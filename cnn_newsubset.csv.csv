"(CNN) -- The most compelling action during Michigan's primary Tuesday will be on the Republican side. The Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen. Hillary Clinton. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigan's economy. In many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last week's New Hampshire contest. The primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Democrats -- can participate. Sen. John McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Michigan. In 2000, McCain defeated then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the Michigan primary. In that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Democrats. Among Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent. In that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right. Overall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Democrats. Michigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is a Democrat, as are the state's two U.S. senators -- Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow. The Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections. Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush. The state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles. Michigan's unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent. Region by region . Wayne County, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Detroit, Michigan's largest city. Detroit is predominantly black and solidly Democratic. North of Wayne County are the more-affluent suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb, which have grown in population in the last two decades. These two counties have been the state's central political battleground in recent elections. West of Wayne is the ""university belt,"" home to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing. The area also includes the industrial cities of Saginaw and Flint, where unions remain strong, as well as Jackson and Bay City. The state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region. The southwest part of the state is dominated by Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city. Grand Rapids is traditionally Dutch-American and has many Christian conservatives and generally votes Republican. The area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities. The economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture, tourism and timber. It traditionally votes Republican. Endorsements . The Detroit Free Press has endorsed McCain. ""While the Free Press differs with McCain on a number of issues, the Arizona senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues,"" the newspaper said in an editorial. The Detroit News also endorsed McCain, citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs, over Michigan native Mitt Romney. ""Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues. But McCain's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation,"" the newspaper said.

"An attorney who says he is representing more than a dozen celebrities whose iCloud accounts were hacked and nude photos stolen fired off a strongly worded letter on Wednesday to Google: Immediately remove all the images from your platforms or face a $100 million lawsuit. Marty Singer -- whose past client roster includes Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt  -- sent a letter to Google on behalf of several  female ""actresses, models, and athletes whose confidential, personal, private photos and videos"" were stolen in late August. Stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Rihanna have reportedly been part of a group of more than 100 who had their accounts hacked and images stolen. Attorney Singer criticized Google for its ""despicable, reprehensible conduct in not only failing to act expeditiously and responsibly to remove the Images, but in knowingly accommodating, facilitating and perpetuating the unlawful conduct."" 5 Things to know about the celebrity nude photo hacking scandal . According to Singer, Google was notified that the images were stolen on more than a dozen occasions. He accuses the company of refusing to act to remove all of the images from its platforms pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. T . The letter notes other website operators and host providers -- including Twitter -- have accommodated take-down demands, but claims Google ""has recklessly allowed these blatant violations to continue in conscious disregard of our clients' rights.""  The letter specifically references images that are still available on Google sites including BlogSpot and YouTube. Singer's letter says: ""Because the victims are celebrities with valuable publicity rights, you do nothing  -- nothing but collect millions of dollars in advertising revenue from your co-conspirator advertising partners as you seek to capitalize on this scandal rather than quash it. Like the NFL, which turned a blind eye while its players assaulted and victimized women and children, Google has turned a blind eye while its sites repeatedly exploit and victimize these women."" Google for its part is disputing the accusations. A spokesperson for the search engine giant told CNN, ""We've removed tens of thousands of pictures -- within hours of the requests being made -- and we have closed hundreds of accounts.  The Internet is used for many good things.  Stealing people's private photos is not one of them."" Singer has not disclosed who he is specifically representing in this case. The FBI investigation into the incidents is ongoing.","Marty Singer is accusing Google of acting ""like the NFL""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Dozens of Chinese workers angry over a pay dispute have held their U.S. boss hostage for five days, the American businessman said. Chip Starnes, co-founder and president of Specialty Medical Supplies China, has been trapped in the company's suburban Beijing factory since Friday. He told CNN it's all because of a misunderstanding about layoffs and severance packages. ""I tried to leave a day and a half ago, and there was like 60 or 70 of them here inside every entrance, and every exit was barricaded,"" Starnes said Tuesday from behind the gates of the factory. ""I can't go anywhere."" Starnes was calm but looked haggard, wearing the same blue jeans and a blue shirt that he said he has been wearing since last week. The incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division. He said he transferred workers to another division, but some workers did not want to move. So the company gave them severance packages. Starnes said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages. But workers who spoke to CNN from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account. Some said they're owed two months' worth of back pay and feared everyone at the plant would be laid off, as they claimed no new materials had entered the factory. Starnes disputed that. ""There are no outstanding balances. There is no reason to be doing this other than bad information,"" he said. ""The wrong information got out. Things snowballed. I am in the process of trying to fix that, but the demands and the amount of money that it is taking to do that puts the company in a bad situation, so there has got to be some compromise."" About four police officers at the scene would not comment on the situation. U.S. embassy officials in Beijing met with Starnes on Monday and confirmed he is safe and is close to reaching an agreement, spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said. He said the executive has access to attorneys. Starnes said the employees haven't caused any physical harm but have disrupted his sleep by banging on doors and windows. He has a cot and is receiving three meals a day, said Les Capella, the U.S president of Specialty Medical Supplies. Capella said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave. But he said the 80 to 100 employees at odds are demanding about $500,000 -- which would bankrupt the company. CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","The U.S. embassy in Beijing says Starnes is safe and has access to lawyers .

"(CNN) -- In many ways, my life is ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. I am a working mother with three young children ages 2, 4 and 6. I got them dressed today. We fought over wearing hats because it was cold outside. I packed their snacks. I dropped them off and kissed their chubby cheeks. I am the PTA treasurer for my daughter's school. I am a volunteer in the community. I am a wife to a partner I have been with nearly 14 years. I live in a suburb. I have all the trappings of a comfortable life. I am content in my daily life. What sets me apart from the typical soccer mom is that I am an outspoken recovering heroin addict. Many people might be familiar with my story from the movie ""Black Tar Heroin: The Dark End of the Street."" I agreed to be featured in the film because I thought it would live on after I died from an overdose as a testimonial to the dangers of drug addiction. Yet I survived eight years of heroin addiction. I was one of the lucky few from that time period when treatment options and evidence-based treatment solutions were limited. I started my journey as a heroin addict while a college student in Cincinnati. I had been given Vicodin after removal of my wisdom teeth. I fell in love with that feeling opiates provided me. My burdens seemed to slip away under the influence. I longed for that feeling. After experimenting with many drugs, I found opiates provided me with the ability to forget my problems. No longer was I obsessed with feeling different. I was happy with being numb. My addiction quickly spiraled until I ended up being a homeless junkie in the streets of San Francisco's Tenderloin district. At first I was doing the drugs, but in short order the drugs began to control every aspect of my life. I was living on the streets and in and out of rat-infested hotels. In a few short years, I was completely unrecognizable as my former self. My last day using was February 26, 1998. I was injecting heroin into the soles of my feet because I no longer had any usable veins. I could barely walk, I was emaciated, and I was relieved when I was arrested that night. I spent my first months off drugs in the San Francisco County Jail. This was not my first time detoxing from heroin. Fortunately, it would be my last time. I was able to get into a treatment program followed by a sober-living house, where I lived for four years. In the years I have been off heroin, I have struggled with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. Many addicts find that once the drugs are removed, the underlying cause to the use can be nearly as painful as the use itself. When the drugs are removed, there can be an overwhelming sense of sadness. Getting clean can be seen as the ultimate solution. When the veil of chemicals lifts, the person may not like what is revealed to him or her. I dealt with these feelings without using heroin. However, the thought crossed my mind many times that relief can easily be found at the bottom of a spoon. That is part of my affliction. Everyone has a different treatment story. The reality for me was and is that stopping use of the substance is relatively easy compared with staying off drugs. The lifetime commitment to abstinence from drugs is what kills many people. When they have cravings to use, the stigma attached to heroin use forces them to deal or not deal with their affliction in private. This decision is frequently fatal, as in the case of Philip Seymour Hoffman. If we were courageous enough to try to conquer our insatiable desire for heroin, we feel weak telling another person that we feel like using is once again a viable option. I know these feelings. Fifteen years later, I still deal with the stigma of being a heroin addict. The track marks and scars are visible, but the pain of longing lies deep under the surface. Many heroin addicts are embarrassed to admit they ever had a problem with this powerful substance. If you are open about it, it triggers speculation and scrutiny as to your personal well-being. Addiction is a medical condition, yet there is little sympathy because society views it to be self-inflicted. I have chosen a different path for myself. I chose to be completely open about my experience in hope that others can learn that recovery is possible. What will I tell my children? They are too young to understand drugs, but they know I used to be homeless. I want them to understand how fortunate they are in hopes they will not go down the same path. What do I say when people see the movie and contact me through social media looking for answers to their own addiction? There are many roads to recovery. The path that I followed worked for me, but I cannot dictate what may work for another user struggling to get off drugs. I can only share my experience. I have spent my second chance at life teaching both harm reduction and overdose prevention because all of us have a life worth saving. I feel blessed I am able to bring a voice and a face to the issue.","Tracey Helton Mitchell says her drug addiction spiraled after she was given painkillers .

"(CNN) -- Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is very softly spoken. The tech titan, now chief executive of mobile payments company Square, is an observer who pays close attention to everything that goes on around him. The 36-year old prefers to listen rather than talk, which may seem ironic for someone who helped re-define how we communicate. But it might explain the brevity of Twitter, the social media phenomenon which distils communication to 140 characters. READ MORE: Dorsey's plans to reinvent shopping . Dorsey, who I meet in a Toronto coffee store, is a little uncomfortable around the media. This is perhaps not a shock given some negative press which has followed his success -- notably from journalist and author Nick Bilton, who painted an unflattering portrait of Dorsey during the early days of Twitter. But he is surprisingly engaging when he is talking to small business owners and Square customers. Dorsey has a real passion for building communities, and that's the common thread between his current venture, Square, and Twitter. They are both about building communities. There are differences: Twitter was wide in scope, while Square is focused on building a community of small businesses. Dorsey, now a billionaire and one of the world's most influential tech brains, grew up in St Louis, Missouri, with parents who were running small coffee and pizza businesses. He's clearly a genuine believer in small companies and their importance to communities and wider economic growth. That's why Dorsey is traveling around the U.S. and Canada, holding Town Hall meetings for small businesses under the banner #LetsTalk. Dorsey wants to talk to business owners about Square, but also connect these local companies to support and mentor each other. READ MORE: Twitter valued at more than $11 billion . Square is the mobile commerce company he set up back in 2009, with the @Square Twitter handle. It began with a credit card reader and has expanded to analytics (Square Register) and service where you can send cash over email (Square Cash). The initial set up is easy and fees are low, which reflects Dorsey's desire for technology to even the commercial playing field. He wants small businesses to have the same shot at success that big businesses have. Dorsey also thinks technology should make the back office administration (billing, inventory, promotions) easier so that the owner or seller can spend more time on the actual business -- in the front of the shop. Ultimately, he wants to revolutionize commerce. READ MORE: Why is Twitter spending so much on R&D? And despite the presence of Paypal, Google and Intuit, Dorsey thinks there is still too much disruption for customers. He refers to a ""frictionless"" experience for customers that releases business to do what it should be doing: Building the economy. Square is in U.S., Canada and Japan already. But Dorsey, in his unassuming way, is pitching to take it around the globe.","Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is promoting his new business, Square, across North America .

"(CNN) -- Heavy snow in northern Japan claimed the lives of eight people over the weekend, while a blizzard forced a high-speed bullet train to derail. In one incident, a woman and her three children were found dead on Saturday after becoming trapped in their car in Nakashibetsu, a town in eastern Hokkaido prefecture, police told CNN. Authorities believe they died of carbon monoxide poisoning as the car's engine was left running and filled with exhaust fumes. The vehicle's exhaust pipe and windows were buried under snow. A 23-year-old woman, also from Nakashibetsu, died Sunday after she was found collapsed on farmland near the town. Police said she had abandoned her car, which was found a few hundred meters away. Elsewhere in the region, a 53-year-old man and his nine-year-old daughter were discovered unconscious after being buried in snow on farmland near Yubetsu in Monbetsu district. The father was pronounced dead at hospital, but his daughter is now conscious and does not have any life-threatening injuries, police said. The two went missing after leaving their home Saturday afternoon in a truck to visit a friend of the father. Police and rescue workers found the truck on a road Saturday evening and the man and his daughter Sunday morning. According to local media, the father had covered his daughter with his body to try to warm her under heavy snow. The bodies of two other men -- ages 74 and 54 -- were also found outside Sunday. They are believed to have gotten lost after leaving their snow-trapped cars, and police say the elder man froze to death; the other's man's death is under investigation. Meanwhile, a six-car bullet train en route from Tokyo to Akita on the high-speed Akita Shinkansen line derailed on Saturday afternoon after the front wheels of the train's first car left the track in blizzard conditions near Daisen in Akita prefecture. Nobody on board was injured, and the service resumed on Monday, a spokesperson for operator JR East told CNN. Local media reports said the train remained in the same spot for six hours in snowy weather with 130 passengers stranded inside. Investigators from JR East are looking into the cause of the incident.","Woman and her children found dead in their snow-trapped car .

"(CNN) -- Government investigators found no proof substantiating reports that miners massacred members of an indigenous community in the Venezuelan Amazon, officials said. But activists and indigenous groups said Monday that the government was too swift in denying that dozens of Yanomami Indians died in an attack that reportedly occurred in July, and that was the subject of a call for action last week by a Yanomami organization and other groups. ""It's far too early for the Venezuelan government to be denying this massacre took place,"" said Chloe Corbin, a spokeswoman for London-based Survival International. Allegations of the massacre trickled out of a remote region along the Brazil-Venezuela border, where unauthorized Brazilian gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups. The Yanomami, who live in both nations, are considered the largest indigenous group in the Americas that remains largely untouched by advances in the outside world. Venezuelan officials said last Wednesday they were investigating reports of an attack. On Saturday, a top official said visits to the region revealed that reports about the alleged massacre were false. ""We can tell the country that there is no evidence of any deaths, nor any evidence of homes burned down in the supposed massacre of 80 of our Yanomami brothers,"" Nicia Maldonado, Venezuela's minister of tribal people, told state-run VTV. On Sunday, the South American country's interior minister described the allegations as ""false news,"" accusing private media companies and members of the opposition of spreading the report. In a Twitter post, Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami said government investigators had visited all of the Yanomami communities and ""all are well."" But a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the Amazon said the investigators hadn't visited the area where the attack is reported to have taken place. For that reason, the groups said in a statement published on the website of the Venezuelan human rights organization Provea, the authorities can't ""say that no evidence proving the alleged massacre has been found."" They urged the government to continue the investigation and to go as far as site of the settlement that was reportedly attacked. The area is a five-hour helicopter ride, or 15 days on foot, from Puerto Ayacucho, the main Venezuelan city in the Amazon, the government said. Survival International, which advocates tribal peoples' rights worldwide, said in a written statement that the government officials' comments are ""not unusual in these circumstances and should be ignored."" ""There is more that needs to be done on the ground to get to the bottom of this reported massacre and find out how many people were affected by it,"" Corbin said. Indians told members of a neighboring Yanomami community that they saw burned bodies and bones in the area where the attack allegedly occurred, according to Survival International, which had contacted local representatives but had not spoken directly with any witnesses of the alleged attack. Of about 80 Yanomami people who lived in the Irotatheri community, only three survivors had been found, according to a declaration published on Survival International's website, purportedly from indigenous organizations. In recent years, the Yanomami tribe has been under increasing pressure as miners illegally entered their land in the search of profits. Miners in Brazil have transmitted diseases such as malaria and flu to the Yanomami, who have little resistance to such diseases, observers say. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigators didn't visit the site of the alleged attack, indigenous groups say .

"Paris (CNN) -- The apparent assassination of three Kurdish women political activists in central Paris on Thursday, all shot in the head, has provoked shock among the Kurdish community. Mystery swirls around the slayings, with no claim of responsibility or any indication from authorities as to who might have pulled the trigger. The fact that one of the women is a founding member of the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK -- a group viewed by Turkey, the United States and others as a terror organization -- has led to heightened speculation. The killings come at a delicate time for Kurds in Turkey, where analysts say the government has recently entered into talks with Kurdish leaders -- among them the jailed head of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan. Analysts suggest the attack could be an attempt to derail a nascent peace process, in what is one of the Middle East's longest-running conflicts. Opinion: How Paris killings could renew Kurd flashpoint . The PKK, a pan-Kurdish nationalist movement, is best known internationally for the guerrilla war it has fought for nearly three decades against the government of Turkey, a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. The ethnic Kurdish population extends across parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls told reporters in Paris the three women had been ""without doubt executed"" and described the killings as ""totally unacceptable."" Report: Turkey's Kurdish conflict has turned more violent . The main pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey, the Peace and Democracy Party, or BDP, identified the three victims as Sakine Cansiz, who was a co-founder of the PKK, Leyla Sonmez and Fidan Dogan. Police said the women's bodies were discovered about 2 a.m. local time in the Information Center for Kurdistan in Paris, located on a busy street behind the Gare du Nord, one of the capital's main train stations. Officers took evidence bags from the building, near which much of the city's Kurdish community lives, but have released few details. Leon Edart, of the Federation of Kurdish Associations in France, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that the women had been alone at the site, which had no security cameras, on Wednesday afternoon. Read more: Turkish town on Syrian border deals with fighting, ethnic differences . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said that French authorities were determined to shed light on the murders and that a judicial inquiry had been opened. So far, authorities have not indicated who might have been responsible. But political leaders in Turkey have been quick to express their shock and revulsion. Turkish government spokesman Bulent Arinc condemned the ""savage"" killing of the women, in comments to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency, saying it was ""utterly wrong."" And the BDP, which has 35 elected members in the Turkish parliament, demanded answers. ""We expect the French government to enlighten this massacre beyond a shadow of doubt. We want it known that these murders committed overtly in the busiest part of Paris cannot be covered up,"" it said. Roj Welat, a spokesman for the PKK leadership in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq, said the PKK had not seen any claims of responsibility and was waiting for the results of the French investigation into the murders, as well as its own probe. ""It is an assassination, it is terror, it is ideological and political assassination, (a) terror attack against the Kurdish people,"" he said. ""Sakine Cansiz has been actively involved in the peace and democracy struggle, freedom struggle, of the Kurdish people for a long time. She was one of the women who participated in the formation of the PKK."" Read more: Turkey police crack down on Kurds . Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst for the International Crisis Group, suggested the killings would ""raise huge questions on the Kurdish side about what's going on"" in relation to the Turkish negotiations. ""No one should use this as an excuse to end these talks. Because this is a unique opportunity, it is a year without any political elections,"" he said. ""Whoever did it, it's very important that the negotiators take steps to reassure each other."" Pope warned against quick pronouncements on the assassin's identity or affiliation, saying the PKK ""has a long history of killing its own people, too. So there's no way anybody can jump to conclusions."" Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, said information was still coming in, but ""when you look how it was carried out, it seems like an internal settling of scores within the PKK."" Read more: Kurdistan officials hope Iraq will allow Turkish minister in . The murders have also left the Kurdish community in Paris and elsewhere reeling. Valls, the French minister, said that Dogan was the head of the Information Center for Kurdistan and that she was known to many in the community through her work. She was also the Paris representative of the Kurdistan National Congress, or KNK, a political group based in Brussels, Belgium. Akif Rizgar Wan, the British representative of the KNK, told CNN he had known Dogan for more than a decade and had last seen her in December. He described her killing as ""terrorism in the middle of Europe"" and an attack on efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish question. ""It's a very big loss for us,"" he said. ""I cannot describe my sadness. I've not seen anyone else in my life so warm and helpful to anyone."" Read more: Jailed leader calls for end of Kurdish hunger strike . About 200 members of the Kurdish community rallied outside the Information Center for Kurdistan on Thursday morning but dispersed soon after. A statement on the French website Jeunesse Kurde (Kurdish Youth) on Thursday urged Kurds and friends of the Kurdish people to gather in Paris. Berivan Akyol, a spokeswoman for the Kurdish Cultural Center in Paris, said a demonstration would be held Saturday. ""We want to condemn these savage executions and the obscure political forces behind them. We are expecting at least 4,000 people,"" she told CNN. More than 150,000 Kurds live in France, many of them in the Paris area, according to BFM-TV. About 90% of the population originates from Turkey, the broadcaster says. Whether the murders will affect the high-profile negotiations in Turkey remains to be seen. Throughout the long conflict in Turkey, the PKK has modified its goals from demanding a separate Kurdish state to fighting for the expansion of Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, as well as the release of Ocalan, the jailed PKK leader. For decades, the Turkish state discriminated against the Kurds, Turkey's largest ethnic minority, which now makes up roughly 20% of the population. The Kurdish language was banned, and Kurds were long referred to as ""mountain Turks."" During Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10 years in power, the government has made historic outreaches to the long-oppressed population, an effort that included secret talks with PKK leaders in 2005. But PKK-related violence has spiked recently, reaching death tolls unseen in more than 13 years, according to a report published by the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit conflict mediation organization.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Explosions took place Tuesday outside two embassies in Greece, and police carried out controlled explosions of three more suspicious parcels addressed to embassies, officials said. The incidents come a day after one person was wounded when a parcel bomb addressed to Greece's Mexican Embassy exploded. The object at the Swiss Embassy on Tuesday was a small bomb that was thrown into the building's courtyard, police said. A separate explosion happened outside the Russian Embassy, police said. It wasn't immediately known what type of device caused that explosion. No one was injured in either incident. Meanwhile, authorities said they detonated a package at the Bulgarian Embassy and a suspicious package addressed to the Chilean Embassy, after a courier carrying the latter parcel thought it might contain an explosive device. The third parcel was addressed to the German Embassy, but it was detonated near a courier office because embassy officials thought it might be a parcel bomb and sent it back, police said. Monday, a parcel bomb addressed to the Mexican Embassy exploded at the same private courier company and wounded a woman there. Two suspects were arrested Monday after police cordoned off the surrounding area, the ministry said. Both were wearing wigs and one of them was wearing a bulletproof vest. Both also were carrying Glock 9mm pistols and were in possession of two other explosive parcels, including one addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the ministry and police said. The other was addressed to the Belgian Embassy. The packages were detonated by police. The arrested men are in their early 20s and are both Greek nationals, police said. One of them is a suspected member of the Greek leftist militant group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire. Another parcel bomb was found nearby Monday at another courier company in the same area. It was addressed to the Dutch Embassy. From Journalist Elinda Labropoulou .","Police detonate parcel addressed to German Embassy .

"(CNN) -- His journey started in Nigeria, a taunted teenager with large tumors on his face, driven into deep despair. Eleven years later, Victor Chukwueke has undergone numerous surgeries and is a step closer to achieving his dream of becoming a doctor. In a rare act, the United States Congress passed a private bill last week granting Chukwueke permanent residency after years of his living in Michigan on an expired visa. The bill is awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. ""The day Congress passed the bill was one of the happiest days of my life,"" says Chukwueke, who left Nigeria as a teen in 2001 to get treatment for the tumors. Private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- seldom pass. His is the only private bill to pass in Congress in two years. ""I was overwhelmed with joy; it was nothing less than a miracle,"" the 26-year-old says. ""Only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like me."" Before coming to the United States at age 15, Chukwueke lived in the southeastern Nigeria town of Ovim. He suffers from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes massive life-threatening tumors on his face. Treated as an outcast because of his deformed face, he was depressed and humiliated, he says. His family abandoned him at an orphanage. Nuns from the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy rescued him from the orphanage more than a decade ago and arranged for a Michigan doctor to perform surgery on him. He says he considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors. ""Without them, I would not have met the nun, left Nigeria, arrived in the U.S. and had the miracle to attend medical school,"" he says. He lives with the nuns in Oak Park, Michigan. They have cared for him since he came to the U.S., where he has undergone seven surgeries, including one that left him blind in the right eye. Doctors performed Chukwueke's surgeries over a period of time, he says, which contributed to his expired visa. Despite the obstacles, he remains committed to getting an education. ""My own personal struggles to receive treatment have motivated and encouraged me to pursue a medical career ... to alleviate the pain and suffering of others,"" he says. ""A medical career will allow me many gratifying years of making a difference in the health and lives of others. I strongly believe one can make another person's life worthy of living ... I have experienced it."" He finished his GED -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college. A benefactor later helped him attend Wayne State University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and chemical biology last year. He had a 3.82 GPA and gave the university's commencement speech. ""Should I call myself a victim, or should I press forward to my dreams?"" he asked during the speech amid thunderous applause. Soon after his graduation, the University of Toledo in Ohio admitted him to medical school. The only hurdle: The program requires him to have permanent residency status, also known as a green card. Though he qualifies for the DREAM Act, which gives immigrants who came to the United States as minors temporary residency, the measure would not give him the permanent status mandated by the university, according to his attorney. And so began Chukwueke's journey to get legalized, a quest that has seen strangers rally to his help. His attorney Thomas K. Ragland took his case pro bono. ""Victor's story is remarkable,"" says Ragland, who is based in Washington D.C. ""Here is this kid who comes from Nigeria, he was taunted and teased for his diseases, and he comes to this country and excels, despite so many surgeries. It is a testament of not letting anything get in the way."" Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, sponsored the bill, S. 285. The measure passed the Senate in the summer and the House last week . ""Already, his example has enriched Michigan and our nation, but I know that his contributions to our country are only beginning,"" Levin said in a statement. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States was estimated at 11.5 million last year. If Obama signs the bill, the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians. That signature, Chukwueke says, will be his favorite holiday gift.","Victor Chukwueke's visa expires after he comes to the U.S. for treatment of tumors .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The bodies of 14 men shot dead -- and with some signs of torture -- were found in an area north of Baghdad on Thursday, police said. The men were taken Wednesday by armed men in military uniforms who raided the mainly Sunni town of Mashahda, police said. Iraq has been engulfed by sectarian violence for many months. According to police, eight of the men were from one family. In other parts of the country, at least 11 people died Thursday in shootings and explosions, police said.

"New York (CNN) -- Former New York Mayor Ed Koch has been dead for more than four months, but a mistake on his tombstone likely would have amused him. Koch was born December 12, 1924, but his tombstone at Trinity Church Cemetery in Upper Manhattan made him appear 18 years younger than he was -- December 12, 1942, was set in stone. The company responsible for the etchings on the marker became aware of the mistake Monday. The transposed numbers were fixed Tuesday morning using composite granite, according to George Arzt, Koch's former press secretary as mayor and his spokesman until his death. The birth and death dates were added within the past 10 days, according to an etching company representative. Koch hired an inscriber after he purchased his tombstone in 2007. He was able to see the engravings were etched as he wished; however, there were no dates at the time, according to Arzt. ""Ed would have loved this attention and called the situation 'ridiculous!' "" Arzt told CNN on Tuesday. Koch was a U.S. congressman from 1968 until he ran for New York mayor in 1977. He served three terms as the city's 105th mayor, from January 1978 to December 1989. Koch died of congestive heart failure on February 1. He was 88 -- despite what his tombstone temporarily calculated.","Ex-New York Mayor Ed Koch's tombstone featured wrong birth year until Tuesday .

"(CNN)  -- The U.S. Coast Guard closed 98 miles of the Mississippi River from New Orleans, Louisiana, southward after a fuel barge and a tanker collided early Wednesday, spilling more than 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Coast Guard personnel try to contain a fuel oil spill in the Mississippi River in New Orleans on Wednesday. The closure -- on what is a major shipping route between the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico -- could last days, and the cleanup could take weeks, said Capt. Lincoln Stroh, the Coast Guard chief in New Orleans. The collision between the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker Tintomara and the barge pushed by the tug Mel Oliver happened about 1:30 a.m.  Wednesday, splitting the barge nearly in half and dumping more than 419,000 gallons of oil into the river, the Coast Guard said. The accident happened just north of the massive bridges connecting downtown New Orleans to the west bank of the Mississippi, the Coast Guard said. The tanker was undamaged.  See a map of where the spill happened » . The Coast Guard said Wednesday evening that the tug had no properly licensed crew on board at the time of the collision. No injuries were reported, and the National Transportation Safety Board said it has dispatched investigators to look into the accident. The accident left a sheen of oil over much of the river and its banks. Booms were deployed to contain the oil, and skimmers are being used to suck it off the surface, said Petty Officer Thomas Blue, a Coast Guard spokesman.  Watch scenes from the oil spill » . The spill is much smaller than the ones that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the Coast Guard estimated that more than 7 million gallons of oil were dumped into the Mississippi and nearby waterways. But Wilma Subra, a chemist who advises the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, said the oil could affect wildlife and work its way up the food chain into residents, many of whom fish for subsistence. ""This is a spill that occurred in a very urban area, and it can impact a very large number of people,"" she said. The oil, widely used as marine fuel, is heavier than diesel but lighter than crude, and it is likely to stick to rocks, trees and wildlife, Stroh said. ""Some will evaporate with sunlight, but there will be residuals in the waterway which need to be cleaned up,"" he said. However, State Department of Environmental Quality officials said the oil is so thick that it could sink, which would complicate the cleanup, the Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported. The Mississippi is the primary source of drinking water for the region, and workers have deployed booms around intakes for local water systems, said Paul Book, the head of the cleanup effort for barge owners American Commercial Lines. Water intakes in the oil spill area -- those for Algiers, Gretna, St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish -- were closed to prevent contamination, though residents there still could get water through their taps because of reserve supplies, the Times-Picayune reported. A swifter-than-normal current quickly drew the slick downstream. The Coast Guard initially closed 29 miles of the river but expanded that to 98 miles by Wednesday evening, the service said. The heavy, sticky oil left a ""real strong"" smell hanging over much of downtown New Orleans, said Carl Bauder, who runs a barber shop near the foot of Canal Street. The Coast Guard's closure of traffic shut down commuter ferries across the river, said Bauder, who lives in the West Bank neighborhood of Algiers. ""[The oil has] done a lot of damage to our Moonwalk area and down by the aquarium,"" he said. Department of Environmental Quality officials said they didn't believe breathing the air near the river would be a problem, adding that emergency personnel were checking the air with portable monitors and hadn't found dangerous hydrocarbon levels, the Times-Picayune reported. New Orleans is among the largest U.S. ports. More than 30 ships were queued early Wednesday afternoon, waiting to pass through the closed zone, Coast Guard spokeswoman Jaclyn Young said. Ships approaching the mouth of the river from the Gulf of Mexico were being asked to stay out, Stroh said.","Ninety-eight miles of Mississippi River closed from New Orleans southward .

"(CNN) -- First it was McLaren, now it's the turn of Ferrari to unveil the car they hope will speed them to victory in the forthcoming Formula One season. The sport's oldest team, based in Maranello, Italy unveiled their new F14 T car on their website on Saturday. A raft of technical changes introduced for the 2014 season sees teams racing with, to the untrained eye at least, similar looking cars but vastly-changed setups -- most notably using smaller 1.6-liter V6 Turbo engines compared to the 2.4-liter V8 engines used last year. Read more: F1 rips up the rulebook . Other significant alterations this year include reconfigured rear wings, the introduction of a new Energy Recovery System and a limit of 100 kilos of fuel per race. Eagle-eyed observers will also note that the nose cone has been lowered and narrowed. Along with Ferrari's new car comes a new driver -- the quietly charismatic Kimi Raikkonen replaces Brazil's Felipe Massa -- and new hope that the Finn and Spain's Fernando Alonso can return the team to championship-winning ways. ""We both want to win and time will tell what will happen and if we can bring the championship back to Ferrari,"" Raikkonen told the Ferrari F1 website. ""We are more than capable, both of us, to be up there and fight for championships."" Raikkonen won the drivers championship in 2007 with Ferrari, the same year they won their last constructor's championship. This year's car is the 60th built by Ferrari for the F1 world championship with the F14 T name being chosen by fans via a poll on the Ferrari F1 team's website. ""It's nice to know the name of the car has been chosen by our fans,"" team principal Stefano Domenicali said. ""The amazing number of votes shows just how popular Ferrari has always been and this will be, as always, a further impetus for us to do well this year!"" Read more: Reliability not speed key to F1 glory in 2014, says Lauda . Twenty-four hours earlier it was McLaren who were unveiling their new car which they hope can wipe away the memory of a dismal 2013 season. The Surrey-based team finished a lowly fifth, 193 points behind fourth place Lotus, with neither Jenson Button nor former teammate Sergio Perez managing a podium finish in 19 races. The MP4-29 is a ""sensible and calculated response to the new regulations,"" McLaren said. Jonathan Neale, managing director of McLaren Racing said in a statement: ""We've never had such significant new regulations before; reacting to them, and managing those changes, while still pushing the performance limits, has been an extremely tough job. ""We've been relatively pragmatic about it. We know that the need for consistency initially outweighs the need for performance -- the winter tests won't be about chasing set-up or refining the car; the envelope of performance is likely to be so wide, and so relatively unknown, that the winter -- and to some extent the opening races -- will be about understanding the operational boundaries of the car as best we can."" Jenson Button, who will be partnered by Dane Kevin Magnussen this season, is looking forward to getting behind the wheel. ""I'm very keen to learn all about the new formula and our new car, and I want us to be in a position where we head to the opening flyaways feeling comfortable with our package, yet still ready to absorb and learn more as we go,"" Button said in a statement. Testing for the new season, which starts in Melbourne on March 16, begins at the end of January in Jerez, Spain.","Legendary Italian F1 team reveal the look of their new car for the 2014 season .

"(CNN) -- The highly anticipated update to the classic 1980s series ""Sweet Valley High"" is here. As we reported in July, ""Sweet Valley Confidential"" (St. Martin's Press) takes place 10 years after high school. The series protagonists -- twin sisters Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield -- are 27 now and on their own, no longer safely ensconced in the split-level, Spanish-style home of their parents. Their perfect figures, cascading blond hair and aquamarine eyes remain. And in case you need any reminders that the book takes place in modern times, there are references to Facebook, Google, Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake. Jessica still lives in the idyllic Sweet Valley and has done something unforgivable to Elizabeth, who has since high-tailed it to New York, utterly brokenhearted. She is also bent on getting revenge, not a typical Elizabeth character trait. CNN spoke to Sweet Valley creator Francine Pascal about the new book and the lasting legacy of the ""Sweet Valley"" franchise, which sold more than 150 million copies worldwide and was the first young adult series to hit The New York Times best-seller list. ""This is the first time in history that a kids' book has made the leap into adulthood,"" the author said. ""And it's a very difficult thing because the people who used to read the books are people of importance, they're grown adults, and they have a certain ownership of 'Sweet Valley' because it was their adolescence. With the new book I hoped not to outrage them and I don't think I have. But I think I have surprised them in a lot of ways and I hope I have touched them."" Pascal, 73, said the inspiration for the first ""Sweet Valley"" book was the 1980s nighttime soap ""Dallas."" She figured that telling the story in series form would suit the soap opera format well because she wouldn't be tied in to providing closure -- she could feel free to leave readers hanging ""with a hook ending and that would give it the feel of continuity."" Pascal said she selected the high school setting because she ""needed a location that was complete in itself."" ""High school is, after all, a microcosm of the real world,"" Pascal said. ""It's the first time kids have some independence and have a world of their own where they're all together and they make the rules and live their life."" ""High school is so serious,"" she continued. ""There's friendship, pain, joy, betrayal, all those incredible things and the very essence of idealism."" Pascal hinted that is exactly why the town of Sweet Valley and its inhabitants are so unbelievably perfect. It is just that -- an idealization. Pascal said she intentionally made her main characters female because it was important ""to do something where the girls drove the action. Up until then it was sort of a 'Sleeping Beauty' kind of thing where you had to wait for the boy to kiss you before you woke up, and this story I wanted to be in the hands of girls."" The author said she made the girls twins because she had always been fascinated by twins and she wanted ""the opportunity to do a Jekyll and Hyde kind of thing where it's really the good and the bad of one person. So I conceived these impossibly (laughs) perfect people with very distinct personalities."" Surprisingly, Pascal concocted the picture-perfect Southern California town of Sweet Valley having never set foot in the state! ""I thought about what was the best thing about your teenage years and it seemed to me it was summer,"" she said. ""So I wanted a place where it was always summer and that's how I came to California."" ""But I didn't actually come to California,"" Pascal said, ""because at the time I had never been to California. Everything I knew about California came from MGM movies. A couple years later I went out there and it turned out it was just the way I thought it was."" When the first ""Sweet Valley High"" book, ""Double Love,"" was published in 1983, Pascal said she had no idea it would be so successful. ""I remember two weeks after it came out the shock of seeing it on the Publisher's Weekly best-seller list,"" said Pascal. ""I was stunned. This was in 1983 -- before the internet -- and I couldn't understand how everyone knew about it so fast. And it wasn't just the hundreds of thousands of readers who bought my four previous books. We were going into the millions."" Pascal is particularly proud that ""Sweet Valley"" turned a lot of young women on to reading. ""I used to get thousands of letters and about a quarter of them started the same way, 'I used to hate to read. ...'And that's the wonderful thing about this series; it really did bring a lot of young women into the reading world."" Ironically, librarians initially thumbed their noses at the notion of ""Sweet Valley."" ""At first they didn't even want to have the books in the library,"" Pascal said. ""Until they saw girls who had never even set foot in the library before ask for them and then they relented."" Pascal, who divides her time between homes in New York and France, said if she were starting the series today, she wouldn't change much, ""because I do feel the more things change the more they stay the same, particularly in adolescence. That's a unique time when many things are happening."" ""These books were translated into 25 different languages,"" Pascal said. ""Which makes you think: 'What does a girl in Indonesia have in common with these blond, blue-eyed girls in California?' Well, with the physical changes girls go through at that age comes a lot of feelings that are the same no matter where you are. So, the fact that there are cell phones and other technological advances now, those are all rather superficial. It's not how people are communicating, it is THE communication."" She pointed out that ""Sweet Valley's"" legacy lies in ""the hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of girls who became readers because of 'Sweet Valley.' Otherwise they may have spent their lives captive of TV."" ""Sweet Valley's"" next incarnation will be a ""Sweet Valley High"" feature film written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody. Pascal said she believes Cody will do right by the series because, ""She grew up with 'Sweet Valley' and she loved it."" Pascal said she thinks the movie should take place in the 1980s, ""Because I think all of the technological stuff is wrong for this. This is, well, a period piece."" Pascal said she is not quite sure what her involvement in the film will be. ""I'd have to go back to the contract,"" she said. ""It's something like story consultant. When material is adapted the original writers are not that involved. They don't hate them or, like in (Robert Altman's) 'The Player,' wish them dead or kill them. But it's gone from New York (laughs).""","The ""Sweet Valley"" series is back and updated .

"(CNN) -- Somalia, Myanmar and Afghanistan have the lowest scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which measures how people in 178 countries and territories view corruption in their public sectors. On a scale of 0-10, with 10 being ""very clean"" and 0 being ""highly corrupt,"" all three countries score below 1.5. Somalia is the lowest at 1.1, while Myanmar and Afghanistan are tied for second at 1.4. At the other end of the list are Denmark, New Zealand and Singapore, which score the highest at 9.3. The United States, with a score of 7.1, is among the countries viewed as least corrupt. It's tied for 22nd overall with Belgium. But while the U.S. is well ahead of neighbor Mexico (3.1), it seems to have some work to do to catch Canada (8.9). The latest scores were drawn from 13 surveys and assessments published between January 2009 and September 2010 by ""independent and reputable institutions,"" according to Transparency International. It defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Transparency International is a nongovernmental organization headquartered in Berlin. It acknowledges that corruption, by nature, is often hidden and therefore difficult to quantify, but it says it has found people's perceptions to be a reliable estimate over the long term. Some other noteworthy scores from the index: . ** Because of activist Anna Hazare and his recent hunger strike, corruption has been brought to the forefront in India. The country scored a 3.3 on the most recent index, putting it among the countries viewed as most corrupt. ** Libya (2.2) and Syria (2.5), were also near the top of the perceived corruption list, something that might not be a surprise considering the recent unrest there. Yemen also scored a 2.2. Egypt (3.1) and Tunisia (4.3) scored better, but not by much. Again, it's important to point out that these surveys were conducted well before these two countries' longtime leaders were ousted. More comparisons: Which country has the smallest gender gap? Where is the Internet most popular? Where are the undernourished? Where do people live the longest? Which countries have the most vacation days? Who requires the most education? Who's got the highest (and lowest) unemployment rates?","Transparency International ranks countries by their perceived levels of corruption .

"Editor's note: Mike Galanos hosts ""Prime News"" from 5-7 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays on HLN. ""Prime News"" uses the day's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives, spirited debate and your points of view. Mike Galanos says child pornography charges are too harsh for teens caught ""sexting."" ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- ""Sexting."" Have parents out there ever even heard of this term? Whether you want to admit it or not, teenagers are sending sexual messages and naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and girlfriends. In most cases it's the girl sending a picture or message to the guy. If you're thinking to yourself right now, ""What's the big deal?"" then you should think again. This practice can ruin our teenagers' lives. Six teens in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, were charged as juveniles with possessing child pornography after three girls sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves to three boys. It gets even worse. A 13-year-old boy in Middletown, Ohio, is facing felony pandering obscenities charges after taping a sex act and showing it to friends at a skating party. A felony? Yes this kid needs to be punished but we don't need our 13 or 14-year-olds charged with child porn and lumped in with adult pedophiles and labeled as sex offenders. I've spoken with several attorneys on our show and it seems there is no one reason prosecutors are opting to charge teens with child porn instead of lesser charges. Some may be doing it to ""send a message."" Some may feel they have an obligation to charge these teens with the most serious offense possible and, according to the law, naked pictures of underage kids are usually considered child porn. And others may feel they are left with no options since there aren't really any laws that apply specifically to sexting. In any case, it's clear we need to change our laws to catch up with technology. A great illustration of why change is needed now is the story of Phillip Alpert, of Orlando, Florida. He didn't ask, but his girlfriend sexted him naked pictures of herself, according to the Orlando Sentinel. When they broke up, he mass e-mailed the photos to get back at her. Alpert, 18, was convicted of transmission of child porn and he will carry the label of ""sex offender"" until he is 43. He lost friends, was kicked out of school, he can't even move in with his dad because his dad lives near a school. Should Phillip be punished? Yes. Should the six teens in Pennsylvania face consequences? Yes. But let's kick them off cheerleading squads and sports teams. Make them do community service and take classes on sex crimes. Educate other teens on the dangers of sexting. Pay a price, yes, but these young people shouldn't pay for this for the rest of their lives. And if you think this couldn't happen to your kid, think again. Sexting is more prevalent than you think. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy teamed up with CosmoGirl.com and asked over 1,200 teens about their sexual behaviors in cyberspace. According to their study, 39 percent of teens (that's ages 13-19) are sending or posting sexually suggestive messages over IM, text or e-mail and around the same number of teens are receiving such messages. Half of those teens, 20 percent, are sending or posting nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves. That's frightening. Why are our kids doing this? On our show, psychotherapist Stacy Kaiser said, ""What I'm finding is a lot of girls are doing this because they're hoping it will help them get or keep a boyfriend."" The numbers agree with Stacy. According to the study, 51 percent of girls say it's ""pressure from guys"" that's making them send sexual messages and pictures of themselves. So guys are expecting this and our girls are saying ""OK."" It makes me wonder how much progress we've really made in how young women are viewed and treated. The bottom line: We need to educate, not incarcerate, our teens and it has to start with parents. Don't let the culture indoctrinate your little boy or girl about sex before their time. So strike first as a parent. If your kids are older, let them know a digital record is for life. When little Suzie tries to win the affection of little Bobby by sexting him a picture, she is putting her future at stake. There is no control over that image or video once it gets out. But that doesn't mean little Suzie should be charged as a child pornographer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Galanos.","Mike Galanos: Teens are sending explicit photos of themselves to other kids .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The U.S. military says only one supply route to Afghanistan has been closed by the Pakistani government after fighting that led to the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers, and a military spokesman said Thursday that United States is hopeful the situation is only temporary. Pakistan banned NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan after the deaths of the three soldiers, whom the government says were killed in Pakistani territory during fighting between NATO troops and militants, according to a military official from the NATO-led command in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an ISAF spokesman,  said the Torkham Gate in the Khyber Agency has been closed since about midday on Thursday. Chaman Gate, the other border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan, remains open. ""We don't think it's a very serious problem,"" Dorrian said. ""it's a throroughfare we use a lot so it is significant. But we can work around it."" ""We do expect these matters to be resolved."" The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad is talking with Pakistan to resolve the situation. Supply convoys are all-important for the Afghan war effort, and officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were trying to persuade Pakistan to lift the ban. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear. Torkham Gate is one of the main ports of entry for materiel coming into the war zone. But he emphasized it's not the only way of getting supplies in, he said. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region. About half the cargo that flows into Afghanistan comes in via one of the two gates from Pakistan, the Defense Department says. Another 30 percent uses two major routes through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one via Russia and the other via the Caucasus. The remaining 20 percent -- mostly sensitive items like weapons, ammunition and other critical equipment -- comes in by air. ISAF said in a statement Thursday that its forces saw what they thought were insurgents trying to fire mortars at a coalition base in the Dand Patan District of Afghanistan's Paktiya province, near the Pakistani border. An air weapons team targeted the suspected insurgents' firing position, located inside Afghanistan along the border area, and the aircraft entered Pakistani airspace briefly ""as they engaged this initial target,"" the ISAF statement said. After this strike, the ""aircraft received what the crews assessed as effective small arms fire from individuals just across the border in Pakistan"" and the ISAF aircraft, operating in self-defense, entered into Pakistani airspace and killed ""several armed individuals."" Later, Pakistani military officials told ISAF that coalition aircraft struck its border forces. ""ISAF and Pakistani forces are reviewing the operational reporting to verify the exact location of the two engagements and the facts in this case, and we will work together to fully investigate this incident. ""Both sides have in mind that it is the insurgents, operating on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan and violating the territorial sovereignty of both countries, that we are focused on fighting,"" the ISAF statement said. ISAF issued ""sincere condolences to the Pakistani military and the families of those who were killed or injured."" The Pakistani government said two helicopters from Afghanistan appeared to have crossed the border into Pakistan in the Mandata Kandaho, Ali Mangola area of the upper Kurram Agency and engaged an outpost of Frontier Corps through cannon fire. The post, manned by six soldiers, is located 200 meters inside Pakistan, and troops fired their rifles to indicate that the helicopters were crossing into Pakistani territory. Instead of heeding the warning, the choppers fired two missiles and destroyed the post, killing the three soldiers and injuring three others. ""This is the third incident of its kind during past one week. In the wake of the last incident on 27 September, contact was made at the highest military level and the incident was regretted by the USA,"" the government said. NATO helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace from Afghanistan in pursuit of insurgents over the weekend, killing 49 people, a spokesman told CNN Monday. Crossing the border did not violate the International Security Assistance Force rules of engagement, Maj. Michael Johnson said. Pakistan is very sensitive about U.S.-led military operations on its territory and issued a strong protest Monday. Pakistan called the incursions ""a clear violation and breach"" of U.N. rules for foreign forces in Afghanistan. The United Nations ""mandate terminates/finishes at the Afghanistan border. There are no agreed hot pursuit rules,"" Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A commander of international forces in the western part of Afghanistan said Thursday that Pakistan's recent ban on use of supply routes is ""not a problem"" for troops in his area of the country. Italian Gen. Claudio Berto, talking to reporters in the Pentagon via satellite from Afghanistan, said, ""In my point of view, it's not a problem, we are really far away from Pakistan, and if you mean the goods for the soldier, they're coming through other borders, for example Turkmenistan. And we have no problem with this issue.""","NEW: About half of U.S. cargo comes into Afghanistan via Pakistan, Pentagon says .

Jurors began deliberations to determine whether e-mail conversations Gilberto Valle had with alleged co-conspirators about plans to kidnap, torture, rape, cook and eat women were real or fantasy role-play. Valle, who was suspended without pay after his arrest in October, is charged in U.S. District Court with conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a law enforcement database illegally. None of Valle's alleged targets was ever victimized. Valle faces life in prison if convicted of conspiracy. Trial: Graphic photos, how-to-kidnap searches found on computer used by cop . In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman argued that the evidence shown in court proved that Valle had entered into an agreement with his co-conspirators to kidnap the alleged targets through e-mail conversations. Waxman argued that Valle conducted surveillance and handed out police charity cards in furtherance of his plan to kidnap the targets. Waxman argued that Valle expressed ""real, practical concern"" for getting caught during his conversations and was methodical and strategic in his online research of how to carry out kidnappings. She said Valle's research of mass murderers and kidnappers were proof that he was trying to be careful about his alleged plan. Waxman urged the jury to use ""common sense"" and look at the ""big picture"" during deliberation. Cop's defense: Cannibalism chats were fantasy . Defense attorney Julia Gatto began her closing statements by repeating ""I have a world in my mind,"" Valle's words to another fantasy role-play partner extracted from e-mail conversations revealed in court. ""In that world I'm kidnapping women and selling them to people interested in buying them,"" she read aloud from Valle's e-mail conversation. She said Valle had engaged in ""dark improv theater"" and said he fantasized about real people to heighten the experience. Gatto told the jury that it was a part of ""crude, stupid, infantile, masturbatory storytelling."" Gatto said the government's case was ""riddled with reasonable doubt."" She noted that testimony in court revealed the FBI did not find the chloroform, rope, or a human-size oven that Valle alleged he had. ""This case is about storytelling, and the government has told a story too,"" Gatto said in court. Graphic e-mails read at New York cannibalism plot trial . Assistant U.S Attorney Randall Jackson said in his rebuttal that evidence proved that ""this was not someone just having fun."" He banged his fist on the table, telling the jury that government evidence revealed ""things you would expect to see in a plot to actively victimize someone."" ""His porn consists of dead bodies,"" Jackson said. ""That is not normal."" In his instructions, Judge Paul Gardephe advised jurors not to convict based solely on the defendant's thoughts alone, or the nature of the content on the Dark Fetish Network reviewed in court. The jury will resume its deliberations Friday morning. Prosecutors: NYPD officer was 'deadly serious' about cannibalism scheme . CNN's Raelyn Johnson and Sunny Hostin contributed to this report.","Jurors get case of Gilberto Valle, charged with conspiracy to kidnap in cannibalism plot .

"(CNN) -- Remember the Muppets? Silly question -- you're old enough to read, so they probably helped teach you. Back when I was kid, they were huge. ""The Muppet Show"" ran five seasons, 1976-1981, and spawned half a dozen film spin-offs. The first Muppet movie (""More entertaining than humanly possible!"") boasted cameos by Bob Hope, Mel Brooks, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, Steve Martin and Richard Pryor -- not to mention Orson Welles -- a bill that positioned Kermit and company as the natural heirs to a half-century or more of prime-time vaudeville shtick. But the brand has fallen into neglect, and it's entirely possible that an otherwise pop savvy 10-year-old wouldn't know his Scooter from his Waldorf. (""Fred the frog?"" my son guessed, when I asked him to name one. ""And isn't there a pig?"") Catch up with Kermit and Miss Piggy . Enter Jason Segel, who fessed up to a fetish for singing puppets in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and who has taken up the challenge of making Jim Henson's fabric-and-thread creations relevant to today's digital generation. Segel, who stars and co-wrote (with ""Sarah Marshall"" director Nicholas Stoller), grabs the bull by the horns, so to speak, by acknowledging that the Muppets' glory days are long gone. That strategy risks making this comeback vehicle too much of a nostalgia trip to entice the kiddies, but their parents will probably lap it up. Gary and Walter are brothers, and inseparable; except that Gary (Segel) is flesh and blood, and Walter ... well, let's just say there's a reason why Walter's favorite show is ""The Muppets."" When Gary invites his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) for a romantic getaway to Los Angeles, it's only natural that he would invite Walter along too: For as long as they both can remember, it's been Walter's dream to visit the Muppet Studios. But when they get there, the building is dilapidated and on the verge of falling into the hands of an unscrupulous oilman, Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). The only way to save it is to persuade Kermit to round up the old gang and put on a telethon: a comeback comedy special. It's not exactly a fresh idea, but Segel and debut director James Bobin (""Flight of the Conchords"") amuse themselves -- and us -- by poking fun at the cornball conventions of movie musicals: When Mary breaks into a melancholy ballad, the sudden downpour on her window pane doesn't come from the heavens, but a gardener's hose. A song-and-dance routine involving the entire population of ""Smalltown"" climaxes in the citizens collapsing into a heap, exhausted. In fact, this early showstopper -- ""Life's a Happy Song"" -- is easily the pick of the new tunes, an infectiously jaunty number written by ""Flight of the Conchords' "" Bret McKenzie. Too many of the rest are strictly novelty items, including an intentionally awful barbershop rendition of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and Chris Cooper rapping, badly. ""Man or Muppet,"" which is supposed to reflect the identity crisis of the two brothers, doesn't make much sense in the circumstances. We can see pretty clearly which is which and where the 2-foot hand puppet really belongs. I hate to be a party pooper. At its best, this is a bright, colorful, perfectly innocuous amusement, but it's also pretty slapdash and disappointingly sluggish. Tim Burton and Paul Reubens worked this line of parodic faux innocence better in ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" 25 years ago (so did Amy Adams in ""Enchanted""). Segel hasn't given himself enough to do as Gary, whose defining characteristic is neglecting Mary -- and if you're going to go to the trouble of inventing a new Muppet (Walter), why make him a bland nonentity? As for the show's true stars, Kermit and Miss Piggy, it's nice to have them back, but I have to say they've never had the same spark since original voice artists Jim Henson and Frank Oz passed the baton to Steve Whitmire and Eric Jacobson. Piggy, in particular, is a pale shadow of the psychotic diva she used to be -- just don't tell that to Jack Black, the guest star she kidnaps and, uh, hogties when no other celebrity volunteers for the telethon. A mixed bag then: ""The Muppets"" isn't the best or the worst of Kermit's big-screen capers. At least it's a reminder that here's one frog who isn't about to croak.","""The Muppets"" isn't the best or the worst of Kermit's big-screen capers .

"(CNN) -- Two teenagers were killed and another wounded during a Christmas night shooting in Newark, New Jersey, authorities said Thursday. The shooting came less than 24 hours after three men were shot to death early Christmas morning outside a bar about a mile away, authorities said. The teens, identified as 13-year-old Zainee Hailey and 14-year-old Kasson Mormon, were pronounced dead at the University Hospital in Newark, police said. A 14-year-old who was not identified was in critical condition, the Essex County prosecutor said. Junior Clark, a Newark resident, told CNN affiliate WCBS he saw the gunman minutes before gunfire erupted. ""I saw the guy with the gun under his arm, under his jacket,"" Clark told WCBS, ""I heard when he shot."" Authorities said the motive for the shooting was unknown. The investigation was being handled by Newark's homicide major crimes task force, which includes officers from the Newark State Police, the Sheriff's Office and the FBI. Earlier on Christmas Day, a few minutes away in Irvington, three men were shot and killed outside Slick's Go Go Bar. The dead included the bar owner's son -- identified as Pierre Clervoyant, 34 -- and nightclub employee Woodley Daniel, 32. The identity of the third victim, who authorities said appeared to be an unintended target, was not released. Two other men were shot and wounded, and their identities and condition were not released. All five men were transported to University Hospital shortly after 1 a.m., where Clervoyant and Daniel were pronounced dead. Authorities said an altercation between the bouncer and the gunman appears to be a catalyst in the shooting, but the motive was being investigated.","Christmas night shooting leaves two New Jersey teens dead, another wounded .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Police are questioning a suspect in connection with an acid attack that disfigured the artistic director of Russia's illustrious Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow authorities said Tuesday. Sergei Filin was doused with acid by a masked assailant in January, an attack that caused severe burns. Russian authorities gave little more detail on the investigation. In January, doctors fought to save Filin's sight and said it may take at least six months for him to recover from the third-degree burns to his face and eyes. He was coming home around midnight January 17 when the unidentified attacker flung concentrated acid at him on a Moscow street, the state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. The agency reported Filin had suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls and the slashed car tires. Shortly before the acid attack, somebody attempted to hack his Facebook page, RIA Novosti said. Filin took up the key role at the world-renowned ballet company in 2011 after three years directing Moscow's Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theater.","An masked attacker doused acid on Sergei Filin, causing severe burns .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- HBO's ""True Blood"" is already in its third season and it is one of the most watched shows on cable. The last show on HBO to garner as large an audience was ""The Sopranos."" The show has tons of fan sites and more ""True Blood"" fanatics worldwide than you can shake a stake at. So what better time to launch a comic book right? Well, that's exactly what creator Alan Ball thought. He, along with publishers IDW and HBO, are putting out the first ""True Blood"" comic book in a series which debuts at Comic-Con. But if you think it's just like the TV show, think again. CNN recently spoke with Ball about the comic book, the show and what's next for ""True Blood."" CNN: So we are going into the third season of ""True Blood."" Alan Ball: Yeah. CNN: It's as popular as ever. There couldn't be a better time to bring out the comic book. Ball: Well, we were approached last year by some comic book publishers and it seemed like a great fit. I mean it seems like there's definitely characters and a story to fill comic books outside of the world of the show. So I said yeah, let's go for it. We got together and we talked about stories, and we came up with a story. Now issue one is ready and it's going to be available at Comic-Con on July 21. CNN: Was it hard to create this comic book series? ... The TV show is based on a book, so are you paralleling the comic book to the actual show? Ball: Well it was a little difficult for me because comics are such a distinct medium in which I have never worked. So I had to learn a little bit about the medium and what it was all about. What we decided to do was to take the characters of the show and put them in a story that's independent of the show itself, but is very true to the mythology of the show. It's not something that is dependent on the show or the show is dependent on it, which makes a lot of sense. CNN: But is it hard to essentially write two different ""True Blood"" scripts? Ball: Well, you have to stay on top of the mythology. You can't have vampires being made one way in the comic book and a different way in the show. You can't have characters having different histories in the show and another one in the comic. ... You just really have to stay true to what we call the bible of the show and not deviate from that. And that's hard. As each year goes on there's more stuff to stay on top of. CNN: The creatures are very interesting in the comic book series. Ball: There is a new creature in the comic book that is different from any creature that we've done on the show. But who's to say what's going to happen in the future. CNN: How hard was it to develop the picture for that? Ball: We actually knew what the creature was. But in terms of how it manifested physically and what powers it had to work with -- well, I sort of left that up to the artist. We knew that it was vicious, it was supernatural, it was not human, and it could do some real damage. And that sort of got incorporated into the writing of the script. CNN: Are you influenced by the fans because many times these fans know stuff that even the ""True Blood"" writers and publicists don't know about. Ball: It's true, they are very hardcore. CNN: Putting a comic book together, are you looking at some of those fan sites to see what people want or what they're saying at all? Are you influenced by that? Ball: I'm not. I personally do not go to those sites. I don't read what people post. There are plenty of people in the writers room who do and communicate things to me. I just don't have the time. And obviously I spend so many hours per day working on ""True Blood"" that in my free time the last thing I want to do is have more ""True Blood"" -- you know what I mean? I tend to read or play with my dogs or go in the canyon or something like that, because I don't want to go crazy. I want to maintain some reality. CNN: So you guys are unveiling the comic book at Comic-Con this week. Who's going to be there? What are we going to see at Comic-Con? Ball: A lot of us are going to be there -- a lot of the cast. I know that Anna and Stephen and Ryan and Sam and Rutina and Nelson and Deborah will be there. I think Joe is going to be there. I don't think Alexander Skarsgard is going to be there because he's going to be shooting a movie. I'm assuming it'll be pretty much the same group, and we have a big panel discussion. We're going to sign autographs and just sort of partake in the wackiness that is Comic-Con. It's really fun. CNN: How many comic books are in the first series? And how many will be put out? Ball: We're going to do six issues this year. I think there will be a new one every month. And then once all six issues are published, they will be bound in a special collector's anthology edition. And I'm assuming we'll do it again next year if it works out well. CNN: So where do you hope to rank in the world of comic books? Ball: Oh I don't know, I'm such a newbie. To use a ""True Blood"" term, I'm such a newbie to the world of comics that I'm not really sure. I know the comic book is really good. It's a really fun story. It's really entertaining. It's all the characters that you know and love in a new situation fighting a new adversary. You also get some very interesting back story on all the characters, which is very true to who they are. I'm very pleased with it. CNN: Since it's independent of the actual show, will you have new characters being introduced into future issues of the comic book series? Ball: There is a main story where one known character encounters this creature in a situation that they can't get out of, and each of them sort of shares a story from their past and that's where we might meet some new people. We'll see some people who may no longer exist on the show. CNN: Okay so give us a sneak peak of upcoming episodes on season three. Ball: Very soon you're going to find out something that is very important from Eric's past and that is going to motivate him and has been motivating him for years. That is a little bit of a big shocker.","""True Blood"" is capitalizing on popularity with a comic book .

"(CNN) -- Arriving for our interview in Berlin this week, Wolfgang Schaeuble seemed eager to be back on the campaign trail. Fresh from his summer break on the North Sea island of Sylt, the German finance minister effortlessly slipped back into what has now become a familiar routine: fielding questions about the eurozone . When asked if he foresaw any more bailouts, Schaeuble said ""No, no I don't see, the problems are not solved but we are in a much better shape than we used to be some years ago."" He pointed to the falling costs of sovereign debt and lower budget deficits across the common currency bloc and ruled out any more haircuts on outstanding government debt. With Germany heading towards elections on September 22, Chancellor Angela Merkel is enjoying unprecedented popularity. Her approval rating is 63% -- more than double that of her nearest rival, former finance minister and now SPD leader Peer Steinbrueck. The chances of a non-Merkel win may be slim. Read more: Full coverage of euro crisis . However, as per Germany's political tradition, whoever emerges victorious will have to form a coalition with one of the other parties, thus clouding the policy outlook for those on the outside looking in. ""I hope we will win,"" Schaeuble told me, then adding: ""We have to fight [but] I think the general mood is in favor of us."" Germany's government is in a curious position of having to serve two constituencies: one it's elected for and another over which it has no formal mandate but a lot of financial sway. As the dominant economy in Europe, Germany has been pivotal in helping to fund and direct troubled member states but its leader has to balance that with her nation's reluctance to be viewed as the rich relative. Read more: Recession over but don't celebrate yet . In this Schaeuble is steadfast: ""If Chancellor Merkel [is] re-elected I am confident that we will continue to work for a stronger Europe -- that's our general position,"" he said. ""We don't want a German Europe but we want a strong Europe and that means every member state including Germany has to increase its competitiveness."" That, he said was about each country doing its duty and ensuring it did ""not to ask for more money by others -- that's the wrong way to get a strong Europe, that's the wrong incentive."" Since Greece was granted its first bailout in 2010 troubled eurozone countries have been granted around 440 billion euros in financial assistance. The cash has been funnelled through the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union in exchange for promises to rein in spending and debt. Germany, which has the deepest pockets, is on the hook for the lion's share of the support -- and as election fever sets in, so has bailout fatigue. Watch more: Sorrell: Why we need strong leadership . Schaeuble reopened old wounds this month by saying Greece would need a third aid program, though when asked by CNN he wouldn't be drawn on the size of the offer, saying it was too early to speculate. However, Greece's Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said the country could be looking for an extra 10 billion euros in aid. It's a figure close to the 11 billion euro shortfall already identified by the IMF, whose 3-year program is set to end next year. As part of a multi-pronged approach to contain the eurozone's existential crisis, leaders have tried to shore up its financial sector by creating a banking union as well as a contingency fund for countries in distress. Read more: Greece may need another 10 billion euros . When combined with the ECB's commitment to ""do what it takes"" to protect confidence in the single currency, such actions may have averted the worst for now. But Schaeuble is under no illusions that without coordinated budgets for the country's using the single currency, the euro will always be vulnerable. I asked him if the move toward closer fiscal cooperation has left the eurozone more politically divided than it has been in its recent history. Schaeuble told me problems arose if there not a solid fiscal framework, saying the bloc has ""made a lot of progress ..to get better conditions, better rules for common fiscal policy."" One thing Schaeuble cannot deny is the benefits to the country's legendary export machine from the weaker currency. Thanks to its flailing adherents, the euro has been less strong than a deutsche mark would have been. However, Schaeuble also pointed to the lower interest rates enjoyed by the countries in Southern Europe. Read more: Tiny nation bucking eurozone's problems . Schaeuble's euro-speak is as fluent and comes from one who has both experience and economic clout. Yet up until now it's a language that hasn't dominated Germany's campaign literature, which has instead been focused on issues like creating jobs, wages and the housing market. Of course the great irony is that while Germany may be looking inwards this election, the world is keeping its eyes peeled for its next move. Just ask Germany's neighbors. They have relied on her in times of crisis, and they will also look to her for the path to recovery.","CNN's Nina dos Santos sat down for a rare interview with German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 69 years ago, Theodore ""Dutch"" Van Kirk navigated a U.S. B-29 Superfortress called the Enola Gay over Hiroshima, Japan, on a sunny August day. Once over its target, the Enola Gay unloaded the first atomic bomb dropped in war. A single bomb blast killed some 140,000 people and helped end World War II -- and pushed the world suddenly into the nuclear era. On Monday, Van Kirk died of natural causes at the Park Springs retirement community in Stone Mountain, Georgia, according to his eldest daughter Vicki Triplett. He was 93. His death means there are now no surviving members of the Enola Gay's crew who, by doing their jobs, became an early and integral part in the ongoing narrative over nuclear weapons. World War II's atomic bombs . While in the U.S. military, Van Kirk flew dozens of missions in Europe and North Africa. Yet the history books will largely remember him and others aboard that B-29 for the morning of August 6, 1945. By then, Van Kirk had flown about 15 missions out of England and about 10 more out of North Africa. He then returned to the United States with new orders, training ""primarily to make the rapid turn and running away from the bomb,"" Van Kirk recalled decades later to CNN. They dropped the bomb dubbed ""Little Boy"" around 8:15 a.m. ""You didn't see anything except a bright flash and the airplane,"" Van Kirk recalled. ""You saw a white cloud hanging over the city. You saw the -- underneath the cloud the entire city was just entirely covered with smoke and dust, and it looked like a pot of boiling oil down there."" His first thought when the bomb fell was ""'God, I'm glad it worked ... Number two, the thoughts were, 'This war is over.' And that was good. That was good.'"" Three days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered soon after that, ending the bloody war in the Pacific and, in so doing, preventing a U.S. land invasion. Hiroshima atomic bomb memorial site attracts tourists, shares history with new generations . It also set the stage for what would become known as the Cold War -- a nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and United States that would go on for decades -- as well as concerns about developing nuclear weaponry that persist in places like North Korea and Iran to this day. Tom Van Kirk told CNN on Tuesday that his father ""felt no regrets about"" the Hiroshima mission. At the same time, he said ""Dutch"" Van Kirk's life was much more than that. After the war, Van Kirk left the military, got his master's degree in chemical engineering at Bucknell University, then had a long career working for DuPont. He retired in 1985 -- a decade after his wife's death -- and remained active, eventually settling in Georgia near one of his daughters. He will be buried in Northumberland -- the central Pennsylvania city in which he was born -- alongside his wife, Tom Van Kirk said. Together, the couple had four children, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren. ""We treasure the fact that we had my dad for 93Â½ years,"" said Tom Van Kirk. ""He was a great father.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If the craggy, icy west coast of Greenland doesn't inspire them, perhaps Vanessa Carlton's vodka infusions will. Singer KT Tunstall relaxes as the Cape Farewell tour heads towards Disko Bay. On Friday, the American singer-songwriter and self-professed ""expert infuser"" will join an unlikely ensemble of 40 artists, scientists and musicians aboard the 10-day ""Cape Farewell"" expedition to Disko Bay. Musicians Jarvis Cocker, KT Tunstall, Martha Wainwright and Leslie Feist will be there negotiating the bridge with acclaimed French artist Sophie Calle, performance artist Laurie Anderson and novelist Nicole Krauss. See the full crew list . They're not there to perform but to be inspired by the scientists, their work and their surroundings, in the hope they'll return home with a deeper understanding of climate change. ""It's two-way traffic,"" explains Cape Farewell founder, artist David Buckland. ""The place itself is inspiring, the dialogue about climate change is inspiring and the science that we actually do on board is important to the scientists, but it's also inspiring to see scientists working. ""You don't just look at a graph; you actually see who gets the data that feeds into the graph. And from all that, the output is that we find this new language, this new way of communication and that's what the creative souls are there to do."" Around midday Friday, the sturdy and ice-strengthened science research vessel, the ""Grigory Mikheev,"" will depart Kangerlussuaq in Greenland bound for Disko Bay, a location on the west coast that provides some of the starkest examples of the island's melting ice caps. There, the geologists on board will acoustically measure the seabed some two kilometers below. ""What happens is that as ice melts from Greenland it lessens the weight on the land and the land rises. This causes cracks to appear in the ocean seafloor -- this is what we think,"" explains Buckland, adding ""So you can measure what's happening to the landmass of Greenland by looking at the sea."" It's fair to say that the work the artists are hoping to achieve on board requires less scientific rigor. When CNN spoke with British comedian Marcus Brigstocke the day before departure, he was trying to decide which suit to pack. ""I'm wearing a suit jacket and a waistcoat, trying to work out what's the lightest thing I can put in my bag which will also keep me sufficiently warm if I do a stand-up routine on an iceberg."" Brigstocke joined the Cape Farewell crew last year on their most ambitious voyage yet, down the east coast of Greenland. After suffering the combined trauma of seasickness and a cabin awash with sewage after a plumbing failure, Brigstocke vowed he'd ""never, ever"" do it again. ""When I asked him, he sort of went white,"" Buckland laughs. ""I promised him a bigger boat this time, in a cabin that doesn't do somersaults. We're not sailing this time, which is a sadness for me, but it means we can do a lot more work."" On his return last year, Brigstocke wove his experience into a stand-up routine. This time, he's hoping to complete the program they started filming last year on climate change and the Cape Farewell trip. ""I don't know what the end result will be,"" he says. ""It doesn't particularly matter. The footage already is astonishing."" Vanessa Carlton, the U.S. musician best known for her Grammy-nominated single ""A Thousand Miles,"" describes herself as ""pretty green."" ""Right now I'm walking and I'm carrying a reusable grocery bag -- I've just been to the grocery store,"" she tells CNN by cell phone from New York. ""I wear mostly vintage clothes. I have a very energy-efficient house -- very long-lasting light bulbs. Everything's off unless I really need something to be on. If I'm away for a long time, I turn off my water heater."" She's intrigued to see how her experience on the Cape Farewell Expedition will manifest itself in her music. She's also unsure of what she can teach the scientists on board. ""Perhaps I will have a more emotional response to the surrounding than they normally do,"" she guesses, adding ""I hope that inspires their work and injects a bit of 'non-scientific' spirit into the voyage."" Or perhaps another kind of spirit: ""I'm an expert vodka infuser and will be teaching a thing or two about infusions."" It was a much more sober affair when Cape Farewell's Youth Expedition wound its way from Iceland, around the southern tip of Greenland, across the Davis Strait and down the coast of Canada earlier this month.  See photos of the Youth Expedition » . Most of the 28 students on board returned to their respective schools this week. Luisa Lizoain, a 16-year-old grade 11 student from the University of Toronto Schools described the experience as life-changing. ""We went to a few small villages when we were in the north of Greenland and Baffin Island,"" Lizoain told CNN. ""Meeting the people who live in the north put a face to climate change for me."" ""I want to try and raise as much awareness as possible and tell as many people as possible about this experience and what I've just seen."" Martin Rose, director of the British Council Canada, which organized the Youth Expedition with Cape Farewell, says, ""It was clear that the snow was late and the glaciers are retreating year by year."" ""There are all sorts of complicated arguments around that, but symbolically it's quite powerful to see green and red hillsides when normally there'd now be snow,"" he continued. Upon boarding, the Youth Expedition students were given sketchbooks and were encouraged to spend at least ten minutes a day being creative. While sketchbooks won't be standard issue for the professional artists on the Disko Bay Expedition, David Buckland says creative freedom will be encouraged. ""If anybody is inspired to do anything we'll stop the boat and we'll do it, we'll find a way to do it, and that's the rule, that's the only rule: follow the inspiration."" And he doesn't care how long it takes. Author Ian McEwan boarded the boat in 2005 and has only just revealed that his new book, ""A Boot Room in The Frozen North,"" is about climate change. ""Brilliant. I can sit and wait for that, that's fine,"" Buckland says. ""It's a difficult subject, it's a great big amorphous subject, it's abstract and therefore to try to make it real, on a human scale, that's the really important message they get across."" Everyone on board the boat will be blogging about their adventure. You can have your say by posting a comment below.","Forty artists and scientists board science research vessel off Greenland coast .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia Judge M. Teresa Sarmina ruled Friday to stay the execution of Terrance Williams and grant a new penalty phase in the case, after finding that authorities had suppressed evidence of alleged sexual abuse. Williams, 46, had been scheduled to be executed on October 3 for a 1984 slaying in which he beat Amos Norwood to death with a tire iron. Sarmina found ""reasonable probability"" that the verdict might have been different had allegations of abuse surfaced during the initial case, noting that the relationship between the two men had been established but not disclosed. Williams attorney Shawn Nolan said the defense team is ""very gratified"" by the decision, having maintained that information about the alleged abuse was withheld from the trial and that Williams' life should instead be spent in a cell. The sexual abuse began when Williams was 6 years old, his attorneys have said. They argued that the jurors who convicted Williams more than 25 years ago were told that it was a robbery-homicide case and never learned of the abuse allegations. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Friday that he would appeal the decision. He has said the abuse allegations are hearsay and ""a last-ditch effort to escape punishment."" ""In the 28 years since the murder of Amos Norwood, these new allegations only came to light just a few months ago, and (Williams) is not the one making the allegations."" Announcing the scheduled execution, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett's office described the brutal Philadelphia killing. Williams and accomplice Marc Draper led Norwood, 56, to an area near a cemetery, forced him to lie on the ground, tied him up, gagged him and stole his valuables, the governor's office said in a statement. ""Williams and Draper repeatedly beat the man with a tire iron and a socket wrench and then drove away in the victim's car. Williams later returned and burned Norwood's body,"" the statement said. Draper is serving a life sentence. On September 17, the state's Board of Pardons failed to reach the unanimous agreement required to recommend clemency. Three members of the five-person panel voted in favor of asking Corbett to consider granting clemency. But the two other board members voted against the petition. Since the execution date was set, a number of high-profile supporters have called for clemency in the case, including Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly. More than 360,000 people have signed an online petition asking authorities to spare Williams' life. Norwood's widow has also asked for the execution to be called off. But Norwood's daughter wants the execution to go forward, the Philadelphia district attorney's office said. She said Friday that accusations of sexual abuse were false and asked the court to uphold the death penalty.","NEW: Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams will appeal the decision .

"(CNN)The Houthi takeover of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa plunges the country into a yet darker chapter of its troubled modern history. An uneasy and sometimes violent standoff between Houthi fighters and forces loyal to President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi took on the appearance of a coup Tuesday, before a tentative power-sharing agreement was announced Wednesday, pulling the country back from the brink. But the deal is far from certain, with previous accords between the government and Houthi rebels having collapsed quickly. Hadi is now essentially powerless, as of Wednesday a prisoner inside his own home. As Yemen collapses into warring factions, and the United States surveys the wreckage with few good options, one party besides the Houthi seems set to benefit: al Qaeda. The Houthi are Shia from northern Yemen and make up about 30% of the population. They've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade. At the beginning of 2014, they won a series of battles close to the Saudi border. And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended on Sanaa. They took over government buildings, the main airport and a share of power. Negotiations ensued, while Houthis seized other towns, cities and areas, including the port of Hodeida on the Red Sea. They continued to build up their presence in Sanaa, and two weeks ago held a huge rally to celebrate the Prophet Mohammed's birthday. One of the Houthis' slogans is daubed on walls in the capital: ""Death to America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews, Victory to Islam."" Now, apparently unhappy with the shape of a draft constitution, they've gone for broke. The Houthis' power grab gave al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula the best recruiting sergeant they could hope for. Always virulently anti-Shia, AQAP was quick to proclaim itself as the defender of the Sunnis against the ""rafidah,"" a derogatory term meaning ""those who reject."" ""Do not leave a checkpoint for (the Houthis) that you do not strike, nor a headquarters that you do not bomb, nor a troop carrier that you do not explode,"" said one of AQAP's leaders, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, in a video released last September, according to a translation by SITE Intelligence. AQAP's first response was a devastating suicide bombing of a Houthi rally in Sanaa, which killed nearly 50 people. It has stepped up attacks against the army and police, which it claims have been infiltrated by Houthi militia. Just last Sunday, it claimed responsibility for killing dozens of Houthis in sniper attacks, bombings and rocket attacks across the country. The authority of the government in Yemen has never been very strong, in a country of fierce tribal loyalties. Now as it collapses, Yemen may divide into areas controlled by the Houthis and areas controlled by others, with AQAP free to expand in remote southern and eastern provinces. Some tribes have already made common cause with AQAP in the face of the encroaching Houthi threat. Yemen is close to becoming a failing state; the sort of place where al Qaeda incubates quickly. Two years ago, AQAP fighters swept through southern Yemen, seizing a number of towns. It took government forces, aided by an aggressive U.S. drone campaign, months to eject them. Now, AQAP may be in a position to strike out again. U.S. officials say AQAP still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb-making know-how with jihadists in Syria, specifically with the Khorasan Group, reputed to be an al Qaeda ""A team"" based in Syria. AQAP chief bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri has three times plotted to bring down U.S.-bound aircraft, coming closest to success on Christmas Day in 2009 when a Nigerian recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above Detroit. Yemen's battle lines are now drawn on much starker Shia-Sunni sectarian lines, echoing recent developments in Syria and Iraq. But in all three countries, there is also a struggle for leadership of Sunni Muslims, between the jihadists like al Qaeda and ISIS and less extreme groups. In Yemen, the Muslim Brotherhood -- in the shape of the Al Islah Party -- is a powerful group well represented in the transitional government. It loathes the Houthi and has its own militias. The fighting in Yemen provides an opening to ISIS, which is keen to outflank al Qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith. In November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on Yemeni Sunnis to resist the Houthis. ""Oh soldiers of Yemen ... oh people of support and aid ... people of wisdom and faith ... be harsh against the Houthi rafidah, for they are kuffar apostates,"" he said in an audio message. ""Fight them and overcome them."" Some Yemeni jihadists, including former mid-level AQAP commander Ma'moun Hatem, have already declared their support for ISIS and al-Baghdadi. A fratricidal battle within the broader war for Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, may become part of an ever-more chaotic scene. Yemeni officials have frequently accused Iran of providing financial support and weapons to the Houthis in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast, on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. President Hadi himself alleged the Houthi were being trained and advised by Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia. Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing anxiety, fearful of Shia-dominated states on both its eastern and western flanks. Inside Yemen, the Houthi appear to be getting help from forces still loyal to the former President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who clung to power until forced out by international pressure two years ago, handing the reins to Hadi, his longtime vice president. Saleh has never accepted retirement, despite serious injuries suffered in a bomb attack in 2011. And through an opportunistic alliance with the Houthis, he has clawed his way back onto the scene, infuriating Washington. In November, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on Saleh, saying ""he had reportedly become one of the primary supporters of violence perpetrated by individuals affiliated with the Huthi group."" ""More recently, as of September 2014, Saleh reportedly has been destabilizing Yemen by using others to undermine the central government and create enough instability to threaten a coup,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said. That threat has now been realized. Yemen may be poor, but it occupies strategic real estate alongside one of the world's most important shipping lanes. And much of that real estate is now ripe for exploitation by al Qaeda's most effective franchise, as it battles a group that looks for moral support, and maybe more, from Tehran.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea conducted its largest-ever nationwide civil defense drill Wednesday afternoon to prepare the public for a potential military attack from North Korea after Pyongyang shelled a South Korean island less than a month ago. ""After the bombing, we believed it was important for the public to know where to take shelter since the South is within five-minute-distance from a North Korean air raid,"" Kim Kwang-hee, the director of civil defense said. The drill involved 12 fighter jets which flew over the airs of Seoul and the country to mock an enemy air drill. More than 250,000 public workers helped civilians take shelter in underground facilities and subway stations, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). Traffic was stopped all across the country, and students were escorted out of school buildings into underground locations. Office workers were asked to move into basement parking lots for cover. Civil defense drills take place on a regular basis and in the past have been ignored by many. However, the threat of war is felt at a greater degree after North Korea shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong in November which resulted in the death of four people. ""We actually don't participate very well, because nothing happened between North Korea and South Korea. But recently it has happened, so it's very serious for us to think about these kinds of events,"" said Chung Woo-sub, a university student. South Korea plans on boosting its underground shelter facilities along the border regions and in the island areas in the Yellow Sea where the island attack occurred, according to NEMA. Also the Defense Ministry announced Wednesday that it has nominated Gen. Kim Sang-ki, commander of the Third Army, for the newly vacated post of South Korea's Army chief, Yonhap news agency reported. Gen. Hwang Eui-don, the former chief of the Army, resigned this week after being accused of using insider information to make money off of a property investment, Yonhap reported .","The drill starts Wednesday afternoon .

"(CNN)Facebook has reunited siblings separated at birth, rekindled old romantic relationships and helped countless people find someone who understands what they are going through. And now, the social media platform has helped one Tennessee family find a home for their unused embryos, according to CNN affiliate WSMV. Angel and Jeff Watts of Mount Juliet, Tennessee struggled to conceive and turned to in vitro fertilization, which they say blessed them with two sets of twins, ages 3 years old and 16 months. The couple was then left with six unused frozen embryos, which they decided to donate and place with the National Embryo Donation Center in Knoxville, WSMV reported. Separated at birth, reunited on Facebook . But two years later, the embryos were still unused and being housed at the donation center. ""What I didn't realize is that there's a lot of competition out there,"" Angel Watts told WSMV in an interview. ""That center has over 300 sets"" of embryos, she said. Each set could be anywhere from one embryo to 24 embryos per donor, said Stephanie Wood-Moyers, marketing and public relations manager for the National Embryo Donation Center. ""The more restrictions, stipulations that the donors place on the recipients, the longer it's going to take to find a match,"" she said. The average wait time for open communications arrangements such as the one Watts was seeking, where the donor has contact with the recipient, could be anywhere from six months to four years, she said. Frustrated and eager to find a home for her embryos, Watts went an unconventional route. She placed a post on Facebook, and detailed the kind of family she and her husband were looking for: married several years, in a steady loving relationship, strong Christian background, roots in Tennessee. ""And I made sure I let people know, you know, this is not a gimmick, no games,"" said Watts. ""I'm not getting any money for this."" The Watts received hundreds of responses, and in less than three weeks settled on a family: Rayn and Richard Galloway of Cookeville, Tennessee. ""We don't look like what people would statistically say 'Oh those people are infertile.' We just look like a happy, young married couple,"" said Rayn Galloway in an interview with WSMV. Don't believe this Facebook hoax . Rayn said she stumbled upon the post and jumped at the possibility. She recently visited with Angel Watts and her family. ""Meeting them and seeing their children and seeing how they interact as a family, their interests, just their personalities as a whole, is very similar to my husband and I,"" she told WSMV. Angel Watts said she wants her kids to know the Galloway family because they will be genetically connected forever. ""We'll be meeting them all along so they'll know us but they won't know us as parents,"" said Watts. Rayn, who plans to have two transfers of three embryos each, with the first transfer possibly by May, said she agrees with Watts on the importance of an open relationship. ""Those are her babies, and she is giving me that gift,"" said Galloway. ""The least that I can do is let her have a relationship, see those children and have a relationship for her own children's sake."" After IVF shock, mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins . Wood-Moyers of the National Embryo Donation Center said there are few laws in most states in the entire country that cover embryo donations in any form. ""It's a little bit of uncharted territory,"" she said. That is why fertility doctors say counseling for anyone going through open donations is crucial so that both families can share their needs, wants and expectations. ""If it works and people are careful, it will work well,"" Dr. Glenn Weitzman of the Nashville Fertility Center told WSMV regarding this unorthodox path of embryo donation. ""That's part of our generation and our new age, our ability to communicate and communicate with a wide range of people on our own without having to go through what might be considered normal channels.""

"(CNN) -- Joe Van Veldhuizen was 19 miles into his first Ironman. He had two hours left to complete the race, and only three miles to go in the 26.2-mile marathon. Every muscle in his body ached, and the blisters on his feet were the size of a half-dollar. But Van Veldhuizen was determined to finish. Completing the 2013 Ironman Coeur D'Alene would be the culmination of everything he had worked for. No shortcuts . Van Veldhuizen changed careers -- from farmer to firefighter -- 10 years ago when the dairy industry took a significant downturn. Being a firefighter meant spending a lot of time sitting around and eating while waiting for the alarm to sound. The 6-foot-tall Albany, Oregon, resident slowly began to put on weight. By 2007, Van Veldhuizen tipped the scales at 250 pounds, which translated to a body mass index of 35. (Anything over 30 is considered obese.) He knew he needed to get that number down. He felt he didn't have the aerobic stamina to do his job well. ""The things that kill firefighters are cancer and heart attacks,"" said Van Veldhuizen, now 45. ""A lot of those heart attacks happen because people aren't in as good of shape as they might be able to be."" Firefighter obesity a big problem . Losing weight wasn't an easy thing for him, but he refused to take shortcuts. His mantra: take it slow and steady through incremental lifestyle changes -- by cutting his portions and exercising more, instead of trying fad diets or using supplements advertised on TV. For Van Veldhuizen, eating less was a big challenge. His solution? Record everything he ate on a nutrition tracking-app on his smartphone. That way he would also know how much time he'd have to spend at the gym that day. Researchers retract study supporting diet pills . His first weight loss regimen was modest: 20 minutes of cardio on the elliptical machine. He found the rotational motion was easier on his joints, especially in the knees and ankles. Slowly, he increased the length and intesity of his workout. A year later, he could do an hour on the elliptical nonstop. He did it at the highest resistance and incline setting two to three times a week. That helped him lose his first 15 pounds, and he felt like he was in much better shape. After mastering that machine, he felt his joints could take it so he started running. That was in 2008. 6 common mistakes new runners make . A year later, Van Veldhuizen entered a 5K run, followed soon after by a 10K. Then a friend suggested he try a triathlon. He had been running, but he didn't even own a bike. So he borrowed one and he also started going to the pool once a week. Eventually he was swimming every day. By December of 2012, Van Veldhuizen had lost 40 pounds. He says he couldn't have reached his goals without the help of friends like Josh Gum. Gum encouraged Van Veldhuizen and trained alongside him. Gum was an Ironman veteran; for those uninitiated, an Ironman race consists of a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bicycle race, topped by a 26.2-mile run -- all done in under 17 hours. Gum left impressed by Van Veldhuizen's dedication. ""It was a remarkable experience for me seeing (Van Veldhuizen's) progress,"" Gum says. Van Veldhuizen ran a half-Ironman in Sun River, Oregon, and then signed up for the Ironman in Idaho in 2013. Your guide to running at any level . A true Ironman . ""It took me 10 hours to do the bike and swim and get my clothes changed and those kinds of things. So I had 7 hours to do a marathon,"" Van Veldhuizen says. He felt good, but near the end of the race he encountered a serious bump in the road -- or rather, a bump in his foot. Van Veldhuizen soon realized that what he thought was an irritating pebble in his shoe was actually a big red blister on his heel. But he didn't panic. Instead, he calculated the miles to go and the time left on the clock. With seven miles to run before the finish line and three hours left, he decided to proceed the same way he tackled his weight loss journey -- with caution. ""You don't know what the next step brings,"" says Van Veldhuizen. ""All of a sudden you step a little funny on a pebble or you step into a pothole and now you've got a twisted ankle."" Step after step, Van Veldhuizen moved toward his goal. Sixteen hours after he began, he completed his maiden Ironman. ""My whole goal wasn't to set any records, it was to finish the thing,"" says Van Veldhuizen. His friend Gum had been in the race too. He managed to catch up with Van Veldhuizen midway through the second lap of the one-loop, 56-mile bike course. That helped a lot. ""It's very much about friends and the support that you can glean off of each other. You don't do these things alone, you do them together. The experience itself for me is a once in a lifetime."" Van Veldhuizen believes anyone who puts his or her mind to it can do the same thing he did. All you have to do, he says, is figure out what you want and then put in the work to get there. 7 weight loss myths (sort of) debunked . These days, Van Veldhuizen says he feels better prepared to tackle the life-saving challenges in his job. His Ironman training gave him more energy and makes him better prepared to jump into action during his 24-hour shifts as a firefighter. This winter, he says he and his family plan to run trails near his home in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. He, his wife, and his 13-year-old have already entered some 5Ks together. And yes, next summer he plans to do another Ironman in Canada. Only this time, he has a new goal. This time he wants to complete it and beat his old time. This time he doesn't want to do anything slowly.","Joe Van Veldhuizen felt like his weight was holding him back from his job as a firefighter .

"(CNN) -- Some Democrats say they fear their party's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination. The Democrats' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party's conventions. Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are running neck and neck toward the party's August convention in Denver, Colorado. Most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then. Party rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers, elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance. The party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention. But even some superdelegates are questioning the system, as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome. ""It's not the most democratic way of doing things,"" said Maine superdelegate Sam Spencer.  Watch the scenario for a ""civil war"" in the Democratic Party » . At least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses. MoveOn.org, which has endorsed Obama, is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in USA Today. And Democracy for America, headed by Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean's brother Jim, said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates. While pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus, superdelegates are free to vote however they want. And even if they pledge their support to a candidate, they're free to change at any time. Clinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157. But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates, 1,096 to 977, and is on a roll, having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday.  See which states pledged delegates come from » . If the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote, the turmoil would last long beyond the convention, longtime Democratic Party strategist Tad Devine said. ""If a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses, but by politicians in some mythical backroom, I think that the public could react strongly against that,"" Devine said. ""The problem is [if] people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead, insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process, particularly the young people who are voting for the first time, will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated,"" he said. Superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate Democrats back to conventions, where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s, and to relect the party's mainstream more accurately. ""[Superdelegates] are the keepers of the faith,"" said former San Francisco, California, Mayor Willie Brown. ""You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party. You don't want the bleed-over from the Green Party, the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be."" Devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984. Mondale's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former Sen. Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson. Mondale had received more votes, but Hart had won more states. Mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor. Each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side. Jason Rae, a 21-year-old Wisconsin superdelegate, said he's gotten calls from former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from Hillary Clinton's camp, and Obama's wife, Michelle, visited with him during a campaign stop Tuesday in Wisconsin. Rae said he hasn't yet decided how he'll vote in Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday. Crystal Strait, a party activist from California, said she's received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted. Massachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he'll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh's state. So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry. Among Clinton's committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr., her husband's former deputy chief of staff; Terry McAuliffe, who led her husband's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign; and her husband. Whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates, even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote, could split the party. ""It's in a total contradiction of the way the Democrats have set up their primary process, with all this proportional representation,"" said CNN political analyst Amy Holmes. ""The whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites. And if this is decided by superdelegates, I think the Democratic Party morally is going to be looking at each other and say, 'What did we just do?' "" Devine said it could hurt the party in the general election. ""I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we're saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness, whether it's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance, there's a fairness component in all of that,"" he said. ""People need to believe, I think, that our process is fair as well, if they want to believe that our policies will be fair."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved a new vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza. Agriflu, made by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu. The vaccine was approved using an accelerated approval process, the FDA said. Novartis demonstrated that the vaccine induces levels of antibodies in the blood that are effective in preventing seasonal influenza, but it still needs to conduct further studies. Agriflu, for ages 18 and older, is administered as a single injection in the upper arm and is available in single-dose, prefilled syringes, according to the FDA. Novartis produces another licensed vaccine for seasonal influenza, Fluvirin, approved for ages 4 and older. Although no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease, vaccination is the key to flu prevention, according to the FDA. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said Agriflu is made in Siena, Italy, with eggs, and it has been available in Europe under the brand name Aggripal. This approval, he said, will add to future seasonal vaccine supplies.","Agriflu, made by Novartis, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus .

"(CNN) -- As health officials continued their investigation into what role a bacterial infection may have had in the deaths of nine hospital patients and the infection of 10 others in six Alabama hospitals, one official acknowledged that they may never find out. ""We don't know, and may never know, if the Serratia marcescens bloodstream infection played a role in the deaths of these patients,"" Dr. Elizabeth D. Ennis, chief medical officer of the Baptist Health System, said Tuesday in a statement. She was referring to the infection caused by rod-shaped bacteria that were discovered in bags used in intravenous feeding -- also referred to as total parenteral nutrition. The infection would have entered the bloodstream easily and ""with a pretty quick effect in terms of blood pressure and temperature,"" said Dr. Donald Williamson of the Alabama Department of Public Health in a conference call Tuesday night with reporters. But the products no longer pose a threat to anyone who has not already been identified, he added. It was not clear how many people in all had been administered the solution, he said. The infected IV bags have been removed from the hospitals and the product has been recalled, he said. ""For the pharmacy and these patients, this is now a closed loop,"" he said. ""The bigger challenge is how did this happen, and what can be done to reduce the risk of contamination in the future."" The nutrition product, which was recalled last Thursday, was made by Birmingham, Alabama-based Meds IV, which did not respond to phone calls left Tuesday and Wednesday; its website was offline on Wednesday. Of the five patients at Shelby Baptist Medical Center who were infected, two died; of the seven infected at Princeton Baptist Medical Center, four died, Ennis said. Of two cases at Select Specialty Hospital, one died; of three cases at Medical West Hospital, one died; the one case at Baptist Prattville proved fatal, but the one case at Cooper Green Hospital did not die, said Dr. Jim McVay, director of healthy promotion and chronic disease for the Alabama Health Department. Baptist Prattville, 80 miles south of Birmingham, was the sole hospital outside the Birmingham area. The outbreak was identified March 16 when two hospitals reported unusual cases of bacteria among high-risk patients -- an outbreak that had begun in late January, according to McVay. Patients who get the product are typically already very sick, McVay said. Williamson praised those involved. ""This is actually the way the system should work,"" he said. ""In this case, a couple of hospitals identified that they were seeing what they perceived to be an unusual number of cases of serratia marcescens bacteremia. ""When they saw that, they contacted us and the CDC and we contacted the CDC and very quickly you got the shutoff of the production of the product, the cessation of use of the product and then you quickly got an investigation done to identify both what the most likely source was as well as where the source came from and some idea of the magnitude of the problem.""

Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton blasted McCain, saying he ""talked about bipartisanship, but didn't mention that he's been a Bush partisan 90 percent of the time, that he's run a Karl Rove campaign, and that he wants to continue this president's disastrous economic and foreign policies for another four years."" ""With John McCain, it's more of the same,"" Burton said. In a speech before a giant screen showing an American flag waving against a blue background, McCain talked about the economy and education and promised to put the people first. ""I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you,"" he said, to cheers from the crowd.

""We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much,"" he said, drawing some of the loudest cheers of the night. He contrasted his aims with those of his opponent, who, he said, would raise taxes and institute a health care system that would force ""small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor."" McCain referred to the 5½ years he spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, explaining that the experience changed his life. ""I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's,"" he said. ""I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's."" His remarks on Iraq were brief, reminding delegates that he fought for the ""right strategy and more troops ... when it wasn't a popular thing to do.""

If he defeats Obama in November, McCain, 72, will become the oldest person ever to be elected to a first term in the White House.

Republicans nominated the Alaska governor Thursday to be their vice presidential candidate, making her the first woman to run for the office as a Republican. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham praised McCain's character, saying he is leading the nation to victory in Iraq by his unflinching support for the surge.  Watch Graham say the surge is working » . ""We know the surge has worked,"" Graham said. ""The only people who deny it are Barack Obama and his buddies at MoveOn.org. Why won't they admit it? ""Because Barack Obama's campaign is built around us losing in Iraq.""

""Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying Barack Obama doesn't care. I'm just saying he doesn't get it,"" he said, echoing Obama's dig at McCain during Obama's acceptance speech last week. ""The surge was a test for Barack Obama. He failed miserably.

""That person is my dear friend John McCain.""  Watch Graham on Obama: ""He doesn't get it"" » . Graham is one of McCain's closest friends in Congress. Another close friend, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, said McCain has ""unique qualifications for the presidency."" ""I speak to you about a warrior who has sometimes stood alone ... and always shown the way,"" he said. Palin was nominated earlier Thursday on a voice vote that Sen. Mitch McConnell recognized as unanimous approval, prompting chants of ""Sarah! Sarah!"" As governor of Alaska, Palin has won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul. Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said in nominating Palin that she had the leadership skills ""born out of experience, hardship, disappointment and success."" ""She's a hockey mom -- a hunter, a hard-hitting reformer -- and quite frankly, she's not afraid to raise a little hell amidst the Washington elite. Which is just what America needs!"" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty then took the stage and warmed up the crowd for the GOP presidential nominee. He said McCain ""understands the concerns of everyday Americans like you and me."" ""John McCain connects with Sam's Club voters. He gets it,"" Pawlenty said. Overnight, crews transformed the stage at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, so delegates would surround McCain while he addressed the convention.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The latest ISIS advance in Syria has brought a swath of the country's north-central Kurdish region under siege, with Kurdish leaders warning of another humanitarian crisis without international intervention. The Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani (Ayn al-Arab in Arabic) is an island, surrounded by ISIS on three fronts and the Turkish border to the north. The town was already mostly blockaded by ISIS, but in the past three days some 60 nearby villages fell under ISIS control, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ""Islamic State,"" as the group calls itself, took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, the Observatory said. Clashes are constant around Kobani as Kurdish fighters attempt to hold off ISIS, which is armed with heavy artillery and tanks, Kurdish activist Mostafa Baly told CNN. ""Mobilization of people in Kobani is not enough,"" said Redur Xelil, a spokesman for the Kurdish fighters. ""The international community has to take action. If not, there will be a new (Sinjar) genocide, but this time in Kobani."" Sinjar is the Iraqi city that came under ISIS attack last month, causing thousands to flee onto adjacent Mount Sinjar, where refugees became stranded and were starving before U.S. airstrikes helped pave a way for them to flee. The fighting around Kobani has been intense for four days, Xelil told CNN. Masoud Barzani, the President of the Kurdish Region in Iraq, called the ISIS attacks in northern Syria ""barbaric"" and described them as ethnic cleansing. ""I ask the international community to take every measure as soon as possible to save Kobani and the people of Syrian Kurdistan from the terrorists,"" he said in a statement. ""The ISIS terrorists perpetrate crimes and atrocities wherever they are, therefore they have to be hit and defeated wherever they are."" As ISIS encroached on the nearby villages, residents fled toward Kobani, said Baly, the Kurdish activist. There were reports that ISIS kidnapped some of those fleeing to Kobani, including women, children and the elderly, Baly said. At least three rockets landed in Kobani, causing much panic, he said. ""There is a great deal of fear, but people are insisting on standing up to ISIS and remaining steadfast in the face of their attack,"" he said. Turkey opens border . The fear of a humanitarian crisis in Kobani rose as displaced people sought refuge there but became trapped between the fighting and the Turkish border. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Kurds fleeing the violence walked right up to the wire border fence with Turkey, where they initially were not allowed in. They just sat at the border as Turkish Kurds on the other side of the fence tried to persuade the Turkish guards to let them in. The situation on the border could be observed on a live feed from the border and from video footage aired on Turkish news outlets. The refugees also tried to force their way into Turkey, creating chaos as one woman stepped on a landmine. Turkey finally opened the border, relieving some of the mounting pressure in Kobani and allowing refugees to enter Sanliurfa province. ""Four thousand of our siblings will be hosted in our country,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told state media. ""Opening our arms to our Syrian brothers is our historic humanitarian responsibility."" Hosting Syrian refugees is nothing new for Turkey and other neighboring nations. About 815,000 registered Syrian refugees were in Turkey as of last month, part of the 3 million total registered Syrian refugees that the U.N. has counted amid Syria's three-year civil war. A further 6.5 million people were believed to be displaced within Syria as of last month, according to the U.N. U.S. military on deck . The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to approve the arming of Syrian rebels as top U.S. military leadership approved a plan to strike ISIS in Syria. The House approved Obama's request Wednesday. The approval allows President Barack Obama to carry out part of his stated strategy to combat ISIS, though some political leaders remain divided on the way forward. With approval in hand to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, Obama said Thursday the plan keeps with ""the key principle"" of U.S. strategy: No American combat troops on the ground. ""The American troops deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,"" he said in televised remarks from the White House. ""Their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground. ... We can destroy ISIL without having our troops fight another ground war in the Middle East."" Obama said more than 40 countries, including Arab nations, have offered assistance in the battle against ISIS. Long vetting and training process . National Security Adviser Susan Rice, speaking to reporters Friday, said that now that approval to arm moderate Syrian rebels has been given, a long process will start to vet and train those who will be benefit from the measure. U.S. military personnel will train the Syrian fighters outside of Syria, and the process of planning the training and vetting the participants will take months, she said. ""This is a serious training program, and we are serious about vetting those we are training and equipping,"" she said. Rice stepped around questions about whether airstrikes against ISIS in Syria will require an additional thumbs-up from President Obama, repeating the President's own announcement that the United States is ""prepared"" to broaden its actions in the region into Syria. ISIS videos . The advance by ISIS in northern Syria comes as the Islamist group released a 55-minute English-language video warning America against ""direct confrontation."" The video describes the conflict as a fight between believers and nonbelievers, and praises its successes on the battlefield. Earlier this week, ISIS released another video showing a captive British journalist criticizing the American and British governments. Citing the Sunni terror group's brutality, from beheading civilians -- including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- to the mass execution of its opponents, Obama said the United States will not back down. ""With their barbaric murder of two Americans, these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world,"" Obama said. ""But today, they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before: As Americans, we do not give in to fear. When you harm our citizens, when you threaten the United States, when you threaten our allies, it doesn't frighten us. It unites us."" The question now appears to be not if, but when, the United States will strike ISIS in its stronghold in northern Syria. The U.S. military has everything it needs to strike ISIS targets in Syria, a plan that officials told CNN is still waiting on Obama's signoff. ISIS, meanwhile, is modifying its behavior, from the way it communicates to the way it conceals itself, in response to potential U.S. airstrikes in Syria, U.S. military officials told CNN. The officials expressed confidence the airstrikes would be effective. Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul, and Mariano Castillo wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Barbara Starr, Jason Hanna and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Group says ISIS has taken over 60 Kurdish villages in three days .

"(CNN) -- Family, food and faith have guided Kylie Kwong to where she is today. The 41-year-old chef has been cooking up a storm with her TV shows and restaurant for over a decade, adding a dash of color and flavor to Australia's cultural life. A third generation Chinese who grew up in the suburbs of Sydney in the 1970s, Kwong left High School to work for an advertising agency. She soon realized, however, that making people feel bad in order to make them buy things they didn't want wasn't for her. Making people happy through good food was much more appealing. After leaving the advertising industry she worked part-time for a caterer where she saw a way to combine the love of cooking she inherited from her mother with a growing interest in creating her own business. She opened her first restaurant ""Billy Kwong"" 10 years ago and it has since become a fixture on the Sydney restaurant scene. ""When I opened the goal was very simple. I wanted to fill it every night and serve really fantastic, amazing, fresh Chinese food out of this funny little arty place,"" she told CNN. ""And I love running a business. It's so challenging. And I love what it brings out of you. You find these hidden strengths you find that you didn't know you had."" Since then Kwong has developed a larger profile through her cooking shows and recipe books. She also let cameras follow her to southern China and the village where her great grandfather once lived; the first time a member of Kwong's immediate family had been there in 90 years. It was a world apart from the suburban Australia that Kwong knew. Coming from the only Chinese family in her suburb, Kwong says she always felt different from other children. ""I certainly felt different when I'd go to school and open the lunch box and there I'd have last night's rice and soy sauce chicken wings and my friend had the Vegemite sandwiches,"" she told CNN. ""And that point it was very good to be different because our food was so much more interesting. Yes, I felt different, yes, my brothers felt different. But it really didn't affect us negatively at all."" In touch with her roots and a vast extended family (family reunions number in the hundreds) Kwong is also a practicing Buddhist who cooked for the Dalai Lama when he visited Australia in 2009. ""It was one of the great weeks of my life. I still can't believe that it actually happened. We spent all week with him backstage in Sydney,"" she said. ""His practice just really encouraged me to keep practicing and doing what we're doing, and to always try harder and harder in everything we do. And to know every single thing that we feel, or think, or do, makes a really big difference.""","Kylie Kwong is an Australian TV chef and restaurateur .

"(CNN) -- Sandbag walls were beginning to rise Tuesday across parts of the Midwest against what the National Weather Service warned could be record flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys over the next week. Widespread major flooding is expected in parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, Indiana, western Kentucky, northern Arkansas and parts of Oklahoma, said Noreen Schwein, deputy for hydrologic services at the National Weather Service's central region headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. Already, governors in Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky have declared emergencies, as have local officials in several counties. National Guard troops are on the job in Missouri and Indiana shoring up levees and stacking sandbags. Indiana also sent 80 prison inmates to the southwestern part of the state, where record flooding was already reported in Gibson County. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn sent 125 members of the Guard to Marion to assist the response in the southern part of the state. Calls for volunteers to help with sandbagging efforts were going out across the region. Clifton Gentry of Jackson, Missouri, was planning to head to the small community of Dutchtown, Missouri, with his church group Tuesday night to help residents there fill and stack sandbags. ""There's a gas station and probably two, three dozen homes that will be under water tomorrow if something doesn't change,"" Gentry said. ""It's basically just the simple fact that we're told to help those in need, and if I was in that kind of situation I would hope someone would help me."" A levee in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, failed on Tuesday, city and county officials said, sending water flooding into a rural but populated area of Butler County, causing the evacuation of more than 6,000 people. People in the area were asked to leave ""as soon as possible,"" Butler County Sheriff's Detective Scott Phelps said. A levee protecting Bell City, Missouri, also failed, said Dale Moreland, public information officer for the Stoddard County Emergency Management Agency. Bell City schools let out early Tuesday because buses will likely not be able to navigate flooded roads later in the day, Moreland said. Up to 1,200 people south and east of Bell City faced possible evacuation later Tuesday. The breach was 95 feet wide and 6 to 8 feet deep. About 25 to 30 residences in in the county were affected by the water and a dozen people have been rescued since Monday, according to Moreland. A levee also failed in nearby Scott County, Moreland said. Missouri's attorney general turned to a federal court Tuesday to stop a federal plan to blow a levee to ease pressure on the flood-engorged Mississippi River. James Pogue, chief spokesman in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Memphis office, said the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway is a ""safety valve"" in the current crisis affecting several states along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. In Paducah, Kentucky, where forecasters are predicting the Ohio River will rise more than it has in at least 61 years, garbage collection was temporarily suspended because every available worker was installing floodgates before the Ohio River rises too high to contain. ""We are putting all our resources on this catastrophe,"" City Engineer Rick Murphy said. Crews were also working to build a steel barrier and extend a levee around the city's convention center, which was at risk of being flooded. The National Weather Service forecast the Ohio River at Paducah to rise to 55 feet by May 3, 16 feet above flood stage and two feet above the high water mark in 1950. Paducah resident Jennie Bell, a CNN iReporter, said heavy rains and river water are already covering some streets, including the road she normally uses to drive her daughter to school. ""It's getting hard to get around,"" she said. In Clark County, Indiana, flooding has forced some people from their homes in the city of Utica and other nearby communities. Some residents have been evacuated. Others are waiting to see what happens, said Phyllis Wilkins, executive director of the Clark County chapter of the American Red Cross. ""There's a lot of U-Haul trailers sitting in driveways ready to go, people sitting on porches watching the waters rise,"" she said. ""Of course, these are people who've lived on the river for a long time so they're used to that routine."" Record or near-record floods are expected from Smithland, Kentucky, to Cairo, Illinois, on the Ohio River and then south to New Madrid, Missouri, downstream from the juncture of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, Schwein said. If predictions are correct, the flooding could surpass records set in a mighty flood that inundated the region in 1937. The Weather Service said the Ohio River at Cairo would crest at 61 feet on May 3, 21 feet above flood stage and 18 inches higher than the 1937 mark. The Mississippi River is forecast to top flood stage as far south as Reserve, Louisiana, according to the agency. The National Weather Service said snow melt from the upper Midwest and rapid runoff from as much as a foot of rain in Mississippi and Ohio river valley states is contributing to the flooding. Three to 5 inches of additional rain expected in the next two days is built into the flooding forecast, Schwein said. Another bulge of water from melting snow is working its way down the Mississippi River now, Schwein said. The bulge, currently in Iowa, will extend the flooding but is not expected to increase crest levels, she said. Springdale, Arkansas, received 17 inches of rain between Friday and midmorning Tuesday. Poplar Bluff, Missouri, saw just shy of 13 inches. Arkansas' Fayetteville and Eureka Springs received more than 12 inches. The total for Carbondale, Illinois, was 8.64 inches and Paducah, Kentucky, was at 8.24 inches.

"Paris (CNN)A picture of French journalists on the roof of Charlie Hebdo's offices sounded the first alarm. They had taken shelter from three armed men who had just opened fire against their colleagues during the weekly satirical newspaper's editorial committee. Events unfolded very rapidly from then on. French President François Hollande was very quick on the scene, the terrorist nature of the events was confirmed almost immediately and so was the shocking number of casualties: 12 dead and 11 injured, some critically. The operation appeared to have been prepared in a military style with weapons of war. What can cartoonists with their pen and paper do against killers with automatic weapons? The news spread fast, sending tremors through France. Then the dead were given names, this is probably when the news really sank in. The cartoonists with the noms de plume Charb, Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous, known to millions in France, had been assassinated, at point blank range. Cabu and Wolinski, in particular, both in their late 70s, have accompanied generations of French people and made them laugh every week, in many different publications, on radio and on television, for over 50 years. I heard people unable to finish their sentences, forced to hang up the phone on learning the news -- too moved to speak. I saw shoppers stopping in their tracks, sinking lost onto benches, others in tears when learning the news from a friend's call. As U.S. Secretary John Kerry later commented, both in French and English, from Washington: France gave democracy to the world and knows better than most the price of Liberty. The French have been shockingly reminded that Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité -- values they fought hard to see every day on the frontispiece of their schools and public buildings -- are threatened by terrorists. While their identities have not yet been confirmed, France, with the largest Muslim community in the Western world (around 6 million out of a population of 66 million) has always been a prime target for Islamist extremists. In 1995, Paris reeled from a wave of terrorist attacks by the Algerian GIA, which killed a total of 12 people. In 1986, the Hezbollah had carried another deadly attack, bombing the grand magasin Tati, and killing 8 passers-by. French secret services were notoriously good at preventing such plots and President Hollande today revealed that many planned attacks had been very recently foiled. There will be a lot of soul searching in the next weeks and months within the French and President Hollande is facing difficult questions and an enormous task. With the far right of Marine Le Pen blowing the flames of national divisions and blaming immigration for France's many social and economic problems, and the left trying very hard not to stigmatize its Muslim citizens, there is little space left for a robust and calm public debate. The news that the French writer Michel Houellebecq, is now under police protection, as a result of today's attack on Charlie Hebdo, means that the French Interior ministry takes no chances with terrorism, but it also shows the depth of the malaise at the heart of French society. Houellebecq's latest novel takes place in 2022 during the presidential elections. After a second round between the far right and a French Islamist, the Islamists are rise to victory with the help of the liberal left -- and France is refounded as an Islamic State. Today, a French imam called the dead journalists and cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo ""martyrs of freedom."" But France may have also discovered the price of its complacency and learned that such Fraternité should never be taken for granted.

"(CNN)A few days ago, when British journalist Charlene White posted on Twitter an apparently unretouched photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford, she launched a firestorm of debate over what women's bodies should look like as they get older. The image showed the 48-year-old Crawford looking sultry, but imperfect, in black lingerie, her bared stomach and thighs characterized by what appears to be some cellulite, wrinkles and sun damage. ""Take a bow, Mrs. C,"" White tweeted. To many, this was a welcome change from photos of the latest celebrity who'd gone the cosmetic surgery route. Over the last year, when Hollywood stars like Renee Zellweger and Uma Thurman appeared in public with new faces, there was speculation that they got plastic surgery and the public reacted with harsh judgment. So it's no surprise that when photo of Crawford was shared all over social media, many people commended White for making it public and Crawford for having ""the guts"" to open herself up to such scrutiny. White told CNN, ""Women come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. I think it's important to see all sorts of body shapes on our screens and in our magazines so that people have a true reflection of what people look like."" But the photo was not, it turns out, from Marie Claire, as White acknowledged. It's an unpublished outtake from a 2013 photo shoot from Marie Claire Mexico and Latin America, which is owned by a different publisher. The image was shared by White without Crawford's knowledge or permission. The irony here, of course, is that White took ownership of an objectified version of Crawford's body in exactly the same way she set out to criticize others of doing. White said to CNN, ""I want people to feel like magazines aren't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies, but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images. ... No one has the right to tell other people how to feel about their body."" And yet, isn't that exactly what White did? Crawford lingerie image stirs debate over what 'real women' look like . If White had done her journalistic due diligence, shouldn't she have made sure the woman in the photo actually felt comfortable having such an intimate photo of herself broadcast to the world? White doesn't know how Crawford feels about that image, and we still don't know. (The supermodel has not yet commented on the photo.) In releasing the image, White made an example of one woman's body to satisfy a personal agenda -- that magazines should show more ""realistic"" images of women. On ""Good Morning America,"" White said, ""I thought I would tweet the picture because I found it incredibly empowering to see someone as beautiful and iconic as Cindy Crawford in her natural form."" To be sure, there is some comfort to be found in that photo. One of the world's most famous models has cellulite! One of the most recognizable female icons grows old and ages just like the rest of us! But in praising this photo, are we implicitly saying that we respect the aging process only when it mirrors our own or when it shows some imperfections? After all, what we like here is that Cindy, in fact, doesn't look all that amazing, and to say she does resonates as more than a little condescending. She is beautiful, to be sure, but what we're celebrating as ""real"" are her flaws. The release of the photo and the response it has generated is quite the opposite of inspiring. The message it seems to convey is that the only way we celebrate a woman's aging body is when we bear witness to its flaws. After all, we call women like 32-year-old Australian model Erin McNaught, who released photos of her toned body four weeks after giving birth, ""vain,"" ""insecure,"" and ""attention-seeking"" because we don't find any comfort in seeing those photos. So let's call a spade a spade. We don't like Crawford's image because it's ""real."" We like it because it's a little startling and a little unattractive, and therefore makes us feel better about ourselves. But that isn't what empowerment is -- using others' faults to downplay or justify our own. We're also not cheering Crawford's bravery in showing the world what even the most genetically blessed 50-year-old women look like, since the photo was very likely shared without her permission. We're using her to make ourselves feel better. Which, of course, could not be more unattractive.","An unretouched photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford was posted on Twitter by journalist Charlene White .

"(CNN) -- While the gaming world is focused on the new Xbox One from Microsoft, Activision is deploying its most popular franchise, ""Call of Duty,"" for its first assault on the next generation of consoles. Developer Infinity Ward has designed new game-engine technology to take advantage of Sony's PlayStation 4 and the new Microsoft console, both due by year's end. Its ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" will come to PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gamers this November 5, with next-gen release dates coming later. In a recent interview in Los Angeles, Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg showed off what next-generation gaming will mean within the new ""Call of Duty"" game. Rather than continuing the ""Modern Warfare"" storyline, the development studio decided to start from scratch with a new story and new characters. ""Ghosts"" sets players in an alternate-future America that's been crippled by a government in disarray. The Ghosts are remnants of the various branches of the Special Forces. They've adopted the best fighting techniques from these branches as they battle across an array of terrains and environments. Also new to the franchise is an interactive dog, which the developers created with the latest performance-capture technology. The dog promises to be a loyal and important companion throughout the game's campaign. This being a ""Call of Duty"" game, there will also be new multiplayer gameplay to entice players to log in and take on friends from around the world on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" adds dynamic maps, including natural events such as floods and earthquakes and player-activated obstacles such as doors and explosive traps. We sat down with Hirshberg to talk about what opportunities next-gen consoles will open up for gamers. Here's an edited version of our interview: . CNN: What will define what next-generation gaming is this fall? Hirshberg: It's interesting. If you look into what's happened in culture, not just in gaming but overall in culture over the last seven years that this current gen has represented, the way that we communicate, the way that we consume entertainment, the way that we connect socially through digital spheres has completely transformed during that exact time period. The current-gen games like ""Call of Duty"" had something to do with that. They were the tip of the sword. Playing multiplayer in ""Call of Duty"" is probably one of the first mass things that people did together in a digital environment. Now we do almost everything together in a digital environment. All of those ways to connect with the devices in your pockets and being able to comment on everything, categorize everything and rank everything, hasn't really made its way into gaming yet. We were ahead of the curve a little bit with ""Call of Duty: Elite,"" which we came out with to try to create a more social experience. One of the things you're going to see with next gen is that with ""Elite,"" we were working around the current-gen limitations in order to make a meaningful connection to the game itself. We had to find our way through an obstacle course technologically to make that happen. Next gen is being designed with that in mind. There's really a baked-in connectivity to the next-gen hardware, the way it's being conceived, that I think will create many more opportunities for social connectivity surrounding video games. CNN: What will that mean to the community of ""Call of Duty"" gamers out there? Hirshberg: We're seeing 40 million people a month playing ""Call of Duty."" Six million people played today. This is 175 days after the launch of the last game. Anything that that many people do and care about, usually there's a whole ecosystem of content to service their interest in that hobby. They don't just watch a football game. They have a fantasy sports league. They have their favorite highlight shows. They have blogs that they read. They have statistics that they view online. They're connecting with that thing on multiple devices, multiple times a day, seven days a week, not just when there's a football game on. With gaming, it's pretty much either you're playing the game or you're not playing the game, and I think that with next gen you're going to see that ecosystem spread to different devices, different times a day, with a lot more supportive entertainment content for our franchises. CNN: When you look at past transitions to new consoles, the focus has been on improved visual fidelity. Hirshberg: You're going to see that, too. But to be fair, last time it wasn't just graphical fidelity. It was the introduction of connected machines. It was the introduction of multiplayer through Playstation Network and Xbox Live. Games like ""Call of Duty"" took that and ran with it, and there's a certain amount of humility we all need to have. No one will see the future exactly accurately, but the creation of those connected networks with the last generation of hardware created an explosion of new games with multiplayer and that's become the primary way people are spending their hours gaming. Next gen is always a combination of hardware design and ... what developers and creative minds do with that hardware. I'm just looking at the main differences and theorizing that that's where you're going to see an explosion of new creativity. CNN: What role do you feel ""Call of Duty"" will play in enticing gamers to upgrade to next gen? Hirshberg: The game needs to be great, but when you have a brand of the scale of ""Call of Duty"" that's so popular and so massive that it has the capacity to be one of the things that people really want to see. If you look at the last console transition, the top franchises were the ones that bridged the gap between the last gen and the current gen, and I think that will happen again. We can't take that for granted and assume that people will show up just because it's a ""Call of Duty."" It has to be a major game, and it has to be demonstrative and emblematic of everything that the next gen is capable of and that's why we're putting this level of investment against it. That's why we're not taking the easy route in doing a sequel to ""Modern Warfare."" That's why we're opening up the franchise and removing the restrictions and doing all new characters and an all new world and taking a whole new approach to the game. We want to set the standard for the next gen. CNN: What are the challenges when it comes to this transition? ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" is also coming out on next gen, but the majority of gamers will be playing on current generation of consoles. Hirshberg: One of the decisions we made early on, which was not a simple decision, but we think it was the right one, is that we have the same exact team developing the game for the current gen as is developing for the next gen. Some publishers have a lead developer doing the next-gen game and then some outsourcing for the current gen. We felt like it was really important to deliver what I think will be the best current-gen ""Call of Duty"" ever because that game's going to benefit from all of the new thinking and all of the new ideas that are going into the next gen. Some of the things from a technological standpoint won't be executable on the current gen, like the Sub D and the texture mapping and that stuff, but all of the gameplay ideas like dynamic maps, character customization, the new story, the new world; the current gen will be the beneficiary of all of those new ideas. I think it's going to be the best current-gen game we've ever made. CNN: Traditionally, with new hardware comes lower price points for current gen. How much life there is in the current-gen systems moving forward, given that PlayStation 2 had a very long tail? Hirshberg: I try to not predict these things. What I know is we're going to have great games on every platform wherever our audience is. This has been Activision's philosophy for a long time. We've always been platform agnostic. Wherever there are gamers that want to have a great experience, we're going to have a great ""Call of Duty"" game for them; we're going to have a great ""Skylanders"" game for them. Even if the next gen is off to the races on Day One, there will still be a lot of people who either are waiting to see or saving their money and who aren't going to dive in right away, and we want them to have a great experience, too.","""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" will go on sale November 5 .

"(CNN) -- Sophisticated fun commands the style scene in Boston and just a stroll down Newbury Street can inspire anyone to dress their best. The fashionable streets were encouragement enough for Martini Severin to begin her style blog, BeyondBostonChic.com, and Severin remains pleasantly surprised by the looks she captures daily. ""The camera in a lot of ways is a passport to getting to know people,"" Severin said. ""I chat with them, learn more about what motivates them sartorially and how they put what they're wearing together. There is no better way to get to know a city than through its residents. The blog has been successful because it's easy to talk to people and hear what it is about this town that makes them sing."" After admiring the stylish residents of Boston for three years, Severin was appalled to learn that GQ's latest poll called it the ""worst dressed city in America."" Severin believes the classy looks with trendy intimations build a sophisticated look for the city and its neighborhoods. ""It's casual sophistication,"" Severin said. ""It's not as high fashion as what you would see in other cities. So it's practical -- but practical with whimsy."" Below, Severin details the diverse elements of Boston street style. CNN: Describe what you see on Boston's streets? Severin: Style here is really chic, sophisticated and very diverse. People have flair, but in a very different way than any other major city. It's about the little, little details that really amount to a tableau that is just seamless. It's wonderful to see how the city changes with each season. I was walking the other day and it was like, ""Wow, everyone looks so good -- what do I shoot?"" The exuberance for style is here in the city and it's alive. Double the style in the Twin Cities . CNN: How do residents remain sartorial in the winter? Severin: It's beautiful in the spring, summer, fall, but in the winter, it's not unlikely that we'll have 17 feet of snow lying on the city. I find that it becomes really difficult to keep your zeal and dress well when you have to put on layers upon layers of clothes. If you need to keep warm, you have to have a fabulous coat. People will have coats that are flower print, plaid, the most beautiful white mohair, and even wear capes. They're really resourceful in finding a coat that will speak to their personality and sense of style. You spend so much of your time in your winter coat, you always want to find something that says a little bit of something about yourself. Dressing up in Dallas . CNN: What trends are you seeing in Boston right now? Severin: You'll see people wearing scarves with polka dots or plaid. We are wholeheartedly loving stripes here in Boston, so everyone is wearing nautical stripes. We're also sun lovers like any other city, so the sandals you see on the street are fabulous -- the strappier the better. CNN: Is there a local designer scene in Boston? Where are people shopping? Severin: There's a movement to shop local in Boston. We have a lot of little boutiques. Newbury Street is our equivalent of Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive. I personally love the smaller stores. I go and they know who I am. It's the kind of city where it's big but it's also small where you can form relationships. Several boutiques are quite popular. Mint Julep -- they sell the prettiest dresses. Then there's a boutique downtown called Flock. It's a mother and daughter team and they personally chose each of the pieces that are in the store. They work with very small, unknown designers and bring their merchandise to Boston to introduce it to a greater audience. There is also a shop, largely for men, called Uniform, that is very nice. There is also quite a vintage culture here in Boston. One store, Bobby From Boston, was started by this man that collects vintage clothing and film wardrobe designers frequent his store and warehouse. It's a privilege to be invited to his warehouse and shop from there. Colorful layers of style on Chicago's streets . CNN: What's coming up for the Boston scene? Severin: Starting September 19, I have an exhibit that's really a great way to say ""Ha!"" to GQ. It's showcasing about 60 of the photos that I've taken through the three years that I've been running the blog and basically, it's the best of Boston and the surrounding areas: Cambridge, Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, Somerville. I feel like it's going to be a really good show in terms of what we have to offer. That coincides with Boston Fashion Week as well, which starts September 23. I feel like the winds are changing in Boston. There are a lot more people who are focused on style here than there used to be. Everyone is doing their part to let the world know, ""We dress well... and we know it.""

"Actor Robert Brown has reached a ""settlement in principle"" in his racial profiling lawsuits against Macy's and New York,  according to court documents and a statement from the retailer. Brown, who appeared on the HBO series ""Treme,"" made headlines last summer after he claimed that he was targeted because of his race while shopping at Macy's flagship store in Manhattan's Herald Square. Papers filed in federal court Wednesday said Brown reached a settlement with both Macy's and the city of New York, whose police department he accused of targeting him because of his race. The settlement terms were not disclosed. In a statement, Macy's Vice President of Media Relations Elina Kazan said the retailer had also settled various other lawsuits accusing the retailer of racial profiling. The statement did not identify the plaintiffs. ""The lawsuits by various plaintiffs who alleged racial profiling by Macy's have been settled in principle,"" the statement said. ""Our company strictly prohibits discrimination of any kind and has zero tolerance for racial profiling. We value every customer who chooses to shop at Macy's, and we remain committed to ensuring that every individual who steps into our store feels welcome and appreciated."" Retailers post customer 'Bill of Rights' after racial profiling allegations . After buying a $1,300 Movado watch for his mother, Brown was shopping for a pair of sunglasses for himself when he was stopped in the middle of the store by three men, whom he believed to be NYPD officers. They accused him of committing credit card fraud and detained him inside the store, according to court documents. ""They cuff me, parade me around the store, all the while maintaining, 'we do this all the time; it's a fake card; you're going to go to jail,' "" Brown said in October, recounting the incident on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Racial profiling costs Arizona county $22 million . Brown was the most notable of several people who said they were targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race last year and the second to accuse Macy's of the practice. Brown filed the class-action lawsuit  on behalf of himself as well as similarly situated individuals of color, according to court documents. Lawyers for Brown did not return calls seeking comment.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Sunday that United States needs to focus on Afghanistan in its battle against terrorism. Sen. Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai meet Sunday in Kabul. ""The Afghan government needs to do more. But we have to understand that the situation is precarious and urgent here in Afghanistan. And I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on our battle against terrorism,"" Obama said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""I think one of the biggest mistakes we've made strategically after 9/11 was to fail to finish the job here, focus our attention here. We got distracted by Iraq,"" he said. Obama said troop levels must increase in Afghanistan. ""For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three,"" he told CBS. ""I think it's very important that we unify command more effectively to coordinate our military activities. But military alone is not going to be enough."" Obama met Sunday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a leader the Democratic senator has criticized for not doing enough to rebuild the war-torn nation. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee met with Karzai in Kabul, the capital city, during Obama's first visit to the Asian nation. Karzai's spokesman characterized the senator's message as pleasant. ""They're happy to be in Afghanistan. They reassured the support of U.S. people to Afghanistan,"" Humayoon Hamidzada said. Karzai met with the congressional delegation that includes Obama, and they discussed the achievements of the Afghan government as well as challenges such as terrorism, corruption and illegal drugs.

McCain's senior foreign policy adviser criticized Obama on Sunday for ""stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal that places politics above the advice of our military commanders, the success of our troops and the security of the American people."" ""Barack Obama is wrong to advocate withdrawal at any cost just as he was wrong to oppose the surge that has put victory within reach. It is a strategy for defeat, and it is the only strategy Barack Obama has ever supported,"" Randy Scheunemann said in a statement. Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan on Saturday to visit American forces under NATO's Regional Command East, the coalition's Combined Joint Task Force said. Obama is joined by Sen. Charles Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, and Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island. In a joint statement released Sunday, the three senators expressed confidence that progress would be made in Afghanistan. ""We need a sense of urgency and determination. We need urgency because the threat from the Taliban and al Qaeda is growing and we must act; we need determination because it will take time to prevail. But with the right strategy and the resources to back it up, we will get the job done,"" they said in the statement. Shortly after meeting with Karzai, Obama left Afghanistan to continue a trip that will take him to the Middle East and Europe. Obama will travel to Jordan, then visit Israel, Germany, France and England. Although Obama is making the trip as a senator from Illinois and not a presidential candidate, it is aimed at boosting Obama's foreign policy credentials.

""This is my favorite thing to do,"" Obama said as he sat with about two dozen soldiers, sailors and airmen in a military mess hall. Ahead of the trip to Afghanistan, Obama, Reed and Hagel stopped in Kuwait to visit U.S. troops, Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs said. They left Washington on Thursday. In Kuwait, the senators visited Camp Arifjan for about two hours to meet with U.S. Army Central leadership, take a brief tour of the base and talk with soldiers, U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Nutter said. The senators also met with about 1,000 military members at a gymnasium, who cheered jubilantly at their arrival. Later, Obama played basketball with some soldiers, drawing cheers from his successful shots.  Watch Obama visit troops in Kuwait » . Asked whether he would have tough talk for the leaders of Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama said he was ""more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking."" ""I think it is very important to recognize that I'm going over there as a U.S. senator. We have one president at a time, so it's the president's job to deliver those messages,"" Obama said. The fight in Afghanistan has become a more pressing issue on the political radar.

"Back in 1998, just as Harry, Bella and Katniss were on the verge of owning the front shelves of bookstores everywhere, the Young Adult Library Services Association launched Teen Read Week in an effort to mold adolescent bookworms. Monday marked the start of 2013's Teen Read Week, but with young adult literature regularly burning up the bestseller lists, it's clear many young adults don't need an excuse to seek out the written word: Sixteen- to 29-year-olds are the largest group checking out books from their local libraries, according to a Pew survey. Wizards, vampires and dystopian future worlds didn't always dominate the genre, which hit its last peak of popularity in the 1970s with the success of controversial novels by the likes of Judy Blume. In the years between, young adult has managed to capture the singular passions of the teen audience over a spectrum of subgenres. Now, as the book industry enjoys a second ""golden age of young adult fiction,"" according to expert Michael Cart, it bears asking why young adult fiction has become so successful. The proof just may be in the timeline. Young adult books that changed our lives . The very beginning . The roots of young adult go back to when ""teenagers"" were given their own distinction as a social demographic: World War II. ""Seventeenth Summer,"" released by Maureen Daly in 1942, is considered to be the first book written and published explicitly for teenagers, according to Cart, an author and the former president of the Young Adult Library Services Association. It was a novel largely for girls about first love. In its footsteps followed other romances, ands sport novels for boys. The term ""young adult"" was coined by the Young Adult Library Services Association during the 1960s to represent the 12-18 age range. Novels of the time, like S. E. Hinton's ""The Outsiders,"" offered a mature contemporary realism directed at adolescents. The focus on culture and serious themes in young adult paved the way for authors to write with more candor about teen issues in the 1970s, Cart said. The first golden age is associated with the authors who the parents of today's teens recognize: Judy Blume, Lois Duncan and Robert Cormier. The young adult books of the 1970s remain true time capsules of the high school experience and the drama of being misunderstood.  Books like Cormier's ""The Chocolate War"" brought a literary sense to books targeted at teens. But once these books devolved into ""single-problem novels"" -- divorce, drug abuse -- teens grew tired of the formulaic stories. The 1980s welcomed in more genre fiction, like horror from Christopher Pike and the beginning of R.L. Stine's ""Fear Street"" series, and adolescent high drama a la ""Sweet Valley High,"" while the '90s were an eclipse for young adult. With fewer teenagers around to soak up young adult lit due to low birth rates in the mid-1970s, books for tweens and middle-schoolers bloomed. But a baby boom in 1992 resulted in a renaissance among teen readers and the second golden age beginning in 2000, Cart said. R.L. Stine aims to give adults 'Goosebumps' ""When I was a teen in the '90s, there were probably three shelves of teen books I wanted to read,"" said Shannon Peterson, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association. ""Now, I feel like it's evolved from three shelves to whole hallways of books."" The book world began marketing directly to teens for the first time at the turn of the millennium. Expansive young adult sections appeared in bookstores, targeting and welcoming teens to discover their very own genre. J.K. Rowling's well-timed ""Harry Potter"" series exploded the category and inspired a whole generation of fantasy series novelists, Cart said. The shift led to success for Stephenie Meyer's ""Twilight"" vampire saga and Suzanne Collins' futuristic ""The Hunger Games."" But why did paranormal and dystopian tales connect so well with teens? ""Just like adolescence is between childhood and adulthood, paranormal, or other, is between human and supernatural,"" said Jennifer Lynn Barnes, a young adult author, Ph.D. and cognitive science scholar. ""Teens are caught between two worlds, childhood and adulthood, and in YA, they can navigate those two worlds and sometimes dualities of other worlds."" Now, reveling in the continued success of fantasy subgenres and series, young adult fiction is enjoying a sustained boom rather than an afterglow. Banned Books Week: Favorite novels challenged . Nostalgic hallmarks . ""It's not surprising that YA is always dealing with transformation, whether it be realistic or supernatural,"" author and publisher Lizzie Skurnick said. ""It's the only genre that can always be both. It shows teen life in full chaos. And that means constant change."" Skurnick is also devoted to reissuing classic young adult novels, from the 1930s to the 1980s. While young adult spans and mashes up multiple genres, it connects readers to transformation stories best through emotion. When David Levithan was helping develop Scholastic's teen imprint, PUSH, in the late '90s, he and his team spoke directly with teens over the course of four years to discover what they wanted in their literature. PUSH launched a line of novels by debut authors with authentic voices in 2001. ""Teens wanted things that were real, that they connected with,"" Levithan said. ""It doesn't have to reflect reality directly. They love 'The Hunger Games' not because it's real in that it happens, but the emotions there are real, and it's very relatable."" Young adult novelists don't shy away from tackling the deepest and darkest issues that teens face, from identity struggles and sexual abuse to drug/alcohol use and suicide. Authors like John Green write about the best and worst of adolescence fearlessly and honestly, building a trust within readers, Peterson said. Author Meg Cabot tried to find books she could relate to as a teen, but the ""single-problem"" novels that resulted in girls dying for their choices frustrated her. She wanted to read the ""science fiction novels about girls spying on other planets."" Now Cabot has written more than 45 young adult books. ""The whole reason you're reading is because you want some hope that you're going to get through whatever you're going through. I know how hard it was as a teenager, and I understood how it felt to be an outsider. I want to be able to offer people hope."" Meg Cabot's teen escapism and empowered heriones . Turning the page . Because young adult fiction is always changing, anything goes, said Elissa Petruzzi, Web and young adult section editor for Book Club Magazine. From sci-fi/fantasy, paranormal and dystopian to classic romance, mystery and contemporary favorites, writers can explore any subject, and readers are eager for new worlds. Contemporary standalones, or non-serial books, have returned to the forefront as a lighter response to dark paranormal and dystopian series, Barnes said. A real opportunity for growth lies in diversity, Peterson said, although young adult already surpasses children's fiction in that aspect. Cart is pleased to see more gay, lesbian and transgender characters in young adult books but admits that there is a multicultural hole, especially for Hispanic teens. Young author faces great expectations in 'The Bone Season' Cabot strives to amp up the empowerment angle for girls. As a teen, she always looked for role model heroines, so all of her female characters ""kick ass."" The genre is also just as open to male readers as it is to females, said Erin Setelius, a writer for the YA Book Addicts blog. ""Boys and girls can fall in love with the same books."" Because filling gaps is an area where young adult succeeds, the ""new adult"" genre has emerged over the past few years (beginning with St. Martin's Press coining the phrase in 2009), featuring characters in their late teens and early 20s going through the college experience and a second adolescence.  Only time will tell whether it's a trend or a budding genre, Petruzzi said. Young adult lit has become popular with readers of all ages and has even allowed parents to see what their teens care about through what they're reading, Skurnick said. After all, 55% of young adult books purchased in 2012 were bought by adults between 18 and 44 years old, according to Bowker Market Research. ""I don't think people are reading it just to relive their teen moments,"" Peterson said. ""It's so interesting to see what happens when there is all of that living, emotion and the heaviness of all that emotion, without the experience. It's such a terrible and beautiful thing to witness."" Follow Ashley Strickland on Twitter: @CNNAshley .","The first ""golden age"" of young adult fiction in the '70s featured drama and realism .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family gathered Tuesday for an early Thanksgiving dinner, determined not to let money and fame pull it apart, the pop icon's older brother said. ""That's really, really important because we're a family and throughout the years, the managers, the agents and Hollywood have tried to come between that,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""What they don't know is we were together before we came out here and we're going to continue to be together."" Jackson spoke to CNN at a Tuesday morning screening of his brother's ""This Is It"" movie for inner-city students in Los Angeles. He said he has stayed away from the Michael Jackson estate legal battle, which pitted his mother's lawyer against his father's lawyer earlier this month. ""When there's a lot of fame and fortune and attorneys, accountants and advisers and managers and agents, it gets like this,"" Jermaine Jackson said. ""But at the same time, my mother is the boss and regardless of what the executors want to do at the end of the day, she has the say."" When family matriarch Katherine Jackson dropped her legal challenge of the men named in Michael Jackson's will to run his estate, family patriarch Joe Jackson's lawyer was launching his own challenge. This set off a bitter courtroom battle between the lawyers for the Jackson parents. ""She has now reneged on her obligation to her family,"" Joe Jackson's lawyer, Brian Oxman, told the judge. He said Katherine Jackson's reversal was ""one of the most despicable displays"" he's ever seen in court. Oxman accused her of reaching a secret deal -- behind Joe Jackson's back -- with the men who control their son's estate. Jermaine Jackson said despite what you may read, the Jackson family will ""pull together."" ""There's strength in numbers, and when there's a family like ours, we pull together,"" he said. ""We find strength within each other."" Katherine Jackson does not celebrate holidays because of her religion -- she a Jehovah's Witness -- but the Jackson brothers, sisters, and their children do traditionally gather for one day Thanksgiving week, he said. Tuesday is the day, he said. ""And it's really tough because Michael's no longer with us, but he'll always be with us in spirit, but you just continue to move on,"" he said. Michael Jackson's three children -- Prince, 12, Paris, 11, and Blanket, 7 -- are ""doing great"" and are ""best friends"" with his children, Jermaine Jackson said. ""They're doing well,"" he said. ""They're getting their lessons done. They have wonderful tutors and programs, they're getting a chance to go out and do things. They're getting a chance to travel."" An A&E network reality TV series that focuses on the lives of four of the Jackson brothers -- Jackie, Jermaine, Tito and Marlon -- debuts next month. Filming of ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty"" -- in the works before Michael Jackson's June 25 death -- is about to wrap, he said. He said his main job now is to promote his brother's legacy. Jermaine Jackson walked down the red carpet with dozens of students before the ""This Is It"" screening. Michael Jackson's vocal coach and several musicians featured in show also were there. Los Angeles artist David Ilan, who is creating a Michael Jackson tribute portrait with 1 million hand-drawn dots, added a dot on his artwork for each of them. The technique, ""pointillism,"" allows Jackson fans worldwide to sign up online to have a dot added in their name.

File image of a Pakistani soldier . The troops were deployed from Pakistan's western border with Afghanistan, where forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Pakistan's armed forces have been on high alert in anticipation of a possible conflict with India following last month's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed 160 people. India believes the 10 men who carried out the attacks were trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. A senior official said the troops had been moved from areas where there are no active military operations, and emphasized that troop levels have not been depleted in areas where soldiers are battling militants, such as the Swat Valley and near Peshawar, capital of the North West region. In addition to the move, leave for all military personnel has been restricted and all troops were called back to active duty, the senior official said. Asked for a reaction to the development, Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the United States, said, ""Pakistan does not seek war, but we need to be vigilant against threats of war emanating from the other side of our eastern border."" He said Pakistan's conduct since the Mumbai attack ""has been consistent with international expectations. There is no justification for threats against Pakistan."" ""Pakistan is also a victim of terrorism and will continue to act against terrorists,"" he added. ""We are a country of rule of law and need evidence to prosecute anyone for the crime of terrorism."" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the United States has been ""in close contact"" with India and Pakistan in probing the Mumbai attack and fighting terror. He is hoping that ""both sides will avoid taking steps that will unnecessarily raise tensions during these already tense times."" In London, England, Pakistani envoy to Britain Wajid Shamsul Hasan countered the report, noting that winter redeployments are normal and that only police and not the army had their vacation canceled. While he criticized India's ""coercive diplomacy"" and regretted India's ""war hysteria,"" he underscored the fact that the two countries don't want to go to war. Tensions increased between nuclear rivals India and Pakistan following the November 26 attacks in Mumbai, where militants launched a coordinated strike against luxury hotels, a Jewish center and other targets. India has criticized Islamabad for not doing enough to counter terrorism, and it has accused elements within the Pakistan government and military of complicity in fueling terrorism in the region. On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned India to refrain from launching any strikes against Pakistan, according to a report in The Nation newspaper. Another unnamed Pakistani military official told CNN that the Pakistani military has been taking precautionary measures to safeguard borders in the face of mounting military threats from India over the Mumbai attacks. ""Naturally, you have to take certain steps to stem that expected tide of Indian operations,"" he said, ""You can't fight on both fronts so we have redeployed certain military elements from the western border to the northern border to meet Indian operations."" The official said that while Pakistan has tolerated U.S. missile strikes from Afghanistan into Pakistan, he believes the government and public would not stand for an Indian incursion. In the Indian capital of New Delhi on Friday, three military chiefs briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the security situation. An Indian officer said Indian soldiers have spotted Pakistani troop movements along the Line of Control in Kashmir. The Line of Control divides the disputed region between the area controlled by India and the area administered by Pakistan. Indian defense spokesman Sitanshu Kar said India isn't carrying out a troop buildup along its western borders but ""is monitoring the situation closely."" He also said he is ""not aware"" of military reports about Pakistani troop mobilization along the Indian border. ""But we are keeping a vigil,"" Kar said. Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18-year, bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead. There also was a limited border conflict in 1999 between the countries in Kashmir.

"Washington (CNN)Jeb Bush got a public blessing from his mom Friday night, who said she changed her mind about having had too many Bushes, a reference to a statement she had once made when asked if son Jeb should run for President. ""Our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America. If America needs you for as long as you can help,"" former first lady Barbara Bush said. Her remarks seemed to flirt with being an endorsement for Jeb Bush to run for the highest office. Yet, they were made in the context of her son's involvement in charity work. Jeb Bush was speaking at a benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy in Bonita Springs, Florida. His mother's comments deliberately and publicly poked fun at the flap over her previous remarks. While talking about the number of family members involved in the cause, Jeb Bush said, ""My mother not long ago said, 'There have been enough Bushes' (in the White House). And it got me thinking, if we've had enough Bushes in one forum, do we have too many Bushes in the family literacy forum today?"" In a surprise for the audience, Barbara Bush appeared on the auditorium's big-screen monitors. She said, ""Just listening in.  Anyway ... what do you mean too many Bushes?  Are you talking about the legacy?  That's not what I'm talking about, but I've changed my mind."" ""Our problems are still so big in illiteracy that it doesn't matter what your last name is."" Jeb Bush said, ""Hey Mom, can I get that in writing, by the way, just for the record?"" His mother responded, ""I said our problems are so big that it doesn't matter what your last name is in America, if America needs you for as long as you can help.  And yes, you can get it in writing and in public."" Jeb responded, ""Mother, I love you. You're the greatest mom in the world and we're so inspired by everything that you (do)"". The camera later panned to former President George H.W. Bush, who was also on the video hookup. CNN's Ashley James contributed to this report.","Former first lady once said there had been too many Bushes in the White House .

"(CNN) -- Teenage sensation Lydia Ko followed up her record-breaking round of 10-under-par on day one of the Women's Australian Open with a score of 69, but it wasn't enough to retain the overall lead. Colombian Mariajo Uribe, whose round of nine-under on Thursday was overshadowed by her 15-year-old rival, again kept a bogey off her card as a 67 took her one shot clear on 15-under. Korean World No. 7 Jiyai Shin is hot on the heels of Uribe, her round of six-under drawing her level with Ko on 14-under as the trio gear up for a battle in Canberra over the weekend. ""I went out just wanting to get in the competition more, after two months without playing, so it was a fun round,"" Uribe told the tournament's official website. ""I made good putts, took advantage of the opportunities and the same thing I did today. So I feel pretty good. ""It's funny because the tournaments I play better are the ones that I'm rusty or that I'm not hitting the ball that well. I think I come in with low expectations and things kind of happen. ""I believe in things that are meant to be and I feel it's meant to be for me to play good this week. Hopefully it stays like that for the weekend.'' It is the first time Uribe has led a tournament at the half way stage but she said she was comfortable with the expectation that brings: ""I'm not the type of player who gets nervous. I love pressure. That's when I play better, usually.'' It was perhaps inevitable Ko wouldn't be able to repeat her heroics from day one but a steady round of four-under means she is well placed to launch an attack to claim the fourth tournament victory of her fledgling career. ""I think four-under is a pretty good score out there. I mean, it's not an easy golf course. I'm pretty sure it is a pretty good score for me,"" she said. ""I mean at some points, because my putting was so good yesterday when it didn't go in I was a little disappointed but I think I putted well out there and played well.""","Colombian Mariajo Uribe usurps Lydia Ko to take the lead at Women's Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Suffice it to say that of all possible storylines to emerge, heading into the election of a new pope, sensational charges of a shadowy ""gay lobby"" (possibly linked to blackmail), whose occult influence may have been behind the resignation of Benedict XVI, would be right at the bottom of the Vatican's wish list. Proof of the Vatican's irritation came with a blistering statement Saturday complaining of ""unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories,"" even suggesting the media is trying to influence the papal election. Two basic questions have to be asked about all this. First, is there really a secret dossier about a network of people inside the Vatican who are linked by their sexual orientation, as Italian newspaper reports have alleged? Second, is this really why Benedict XVI quit? The best answers, respectively, are ""maybe"" and ""probably not."" It's a matter of record that at the peak of last year's massive Vatican leaks crisis, Benedict XVI created a commission of three cardinals to investigate the leaks. They submitted an eyes-only report to the pope in mid-December, which has not been made public. It's impossible to confirm whether that report looked into the possibility that people protecting secrets about their sex lives were involved with the leaks, but frankly, it would be surprising if it didn't. There are certainly compelling reasons to consider the hypothesis. In 2007, a Vatican official was caught by an Italian TV network on hidden camera arranging a date through a gay-oriented chat room, and then taking the young man back to his Vatican apartment. In 2010, a papal ceremonial officer was caught on a wiretap arranging liaisons through a Nigerian member of a Vatican choir. Both episodes played out in full public view, and gave the Vatican a black eye. In that context, it would be a little odd if the cardinals didn't at least consider the possibility that insiders leading a double life might be vulnerable to pressure to betray the pope's confidence. That would apply not just to sex, but also potential conflicts of other sorts too, such as financial interests. Vatican officials have said Benedict may authorize giving the report to the 116 cardinals who will elect his successor, so they can factor it into their deliberations. The most immediate fallout is that the affair is likely to strengthen the conviction among many cardinals that the next pope has to lead a serious house-cleaning inside the Vatican's bureaucracy. It seems a stretch, however, to suggest this is the real reason Benedict is leaving. For the most part, one should probably take the pope at his word, that old age and fatigue are the motives for his decision. That said, it's hard not to suspect that the meltdowns and controversies that have dogged Benedict XVI for the last eight years are in the background of why he's so tired. In 2009, at the height of another frenzy surrounding the lifting of the excommunication of a Holocaust-denying traditionalist bishop, Benedict dispatched a plaintive letter to the bishops of the world, voicing hurt for the way he'd been attacked and apologizing for the Vatican's mishandling of the situation. Even if Benedict didn't resign because of any specific crisis, including this latest one, such anguish must have taken its toll. Benedict is a teaching pope, a man who prefers the life of the mind to the nuts and bolts of government, yet an enormous share of his time and energy has been consumed trying to put out internal fires. It's hard to know why Benedict XVI is stepping off the stage, but I doubt it is because of a ""gay lobby."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John L. Allen Jr.","Benedict XVI not stepping down under pressure from 'gay lobby,' Allen says .
Allen: Benedict is a man who prefers the life of the mind to the nuts and bolts of government .
However, he says, much of the pope's time has been spent putting out fires .",f2fe18c0283094135979bd58282d99a335e097ad
"A 37-year-old gay mom is set to spark controversy after she said she'd be disappointed if her six-year-old daughter wasn't gay when she grows up. Sally Kohn a political commentator who has appeared on CNN and MSNBC, describes herself as living in the 'liberal bubble of Park Slope, Brooklyn, where 'yuppies' want their kids to be happy.

And I want my kid to be gay, too' In a lengthy essay in The Washington Post  Kohn explained that, she, like most parents simply wants her child to follow in her footsteps. She writes: 'If we went to college, we want our kids to go to college. If we like sports, we want our kids to like sports. If we vote Democrat, of course we want our kids to vote Democrat.' Kohn said: 'When my daughter plays house with her stuffed koala bears as the mom and dad, we gently remind her that they could be a dad and dad. 'Sometimes she changes her narrative. Sometimes she doesn't. It's her choice.' 'Time will tell, but so far, it doesn't look like my six-year-old daughter is gay. In fact, she's boy crazy.' Kohn, a liberal political commentator, community organizer, and founder and chief executive officer of the Movement Vision Lab, a grassroots think tank is also a contributor to the Fox News Channel. She is raising her six-year-old girl daughter, Willa Hansen Kohn, along with her partner Sarah Hansen, whom she met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2003. Hansen works in philanthropy advising foundations how to best support groups in the social and environmental justice movements. Bond: Kohn, right, and her partner Hansen hold their daughter, Willa, center, in their arms during a trip .

Parenting: Kohn, pictured here with her daughter as a baby said 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life' Kohn, however, is no stranger to controversy. In 2014, she wrote that referring to an undocumented person as an 'illegal immigrant' was like calling a black person the N-word. Meanwhile, she often writes about how her sexuality impacts her parenting style. In a parenting blog for The New York Times she described her experience of being 'a butch lesbian' taking her five year old daughter for a Princess makeover at Disney World. She wrote: I have been a tomboy all my life. When I played with dolls they were usually being sacrificed in some sort of erupting volcano-like mud hole in my backyard or running for their lives.' 'My partner and I certainly didn’t teach our daughter to like pink and ruffles and such. And I can’t fathom some genetic or biological nodule that predisposes my girl to like dolls while little boys like trucks. Baloney.' She adds: 'Even in the midst of our hyper-liberal and hyper-diverse neighborhood with girls and boys of all kinds on display every day, it happened. 'Did I do something wrong? Is feminism mysteriously skipping a generation? Meanwhile, I have to bribe her to wear jeans.' In 2010 she posted a Youtube video of her then two year-old daughter entitled 'My 2 year old explains the Bush tax cuts' featuring the precocious little girl. Kohn said: 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life — helping to perpetuate discrimination that might otherwise fade' And while the pundit is known for her outspoken views, she admits that her straight friends have a massive problem with her wanting her daughter to be gay when she grows up. She wrote: [One friend asked] 'Don't you want her to be happy?' She adds: 'A friend once told me 'I wouldn't even choose for myself to be gay.' It was a sad admission, because she was.' She goes on to suggest that there is a widely-held viewpoint that 'no one would choose to be gay — even in the gay rights movement.' She adds: 'I've never for a single second regretted being gay, nor saw it as anything other than an asset and a gift. 'My parents were ridiculously supportive from Day One, and I had a great community of friends and mentors who made me feel unconditionally accepted. 'By the time my daughter comes of age, she'll have even more of a support network, including two moms, for crying out loud. 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life — helping to perpetuate discrimination that might otherwise fade more quickly. 'I want my daughter to know that being gay is equally desirable to being straight. 'The problem is not the idea that homosexuality could be a choice but the idea that heterosexuality should be compulsory. 'In my house it's plainly, evidently not.

"New York (CNN) -- In the aftermath of one of the worst weather systems to hit the Northeast, finding adequate shelter is the big concern. What to do with displaced residents, whose homes were rendered dark, cold and powerless by Superstorm Sandy, is now the question plaguing emergency management officials across the Tri-State area. FEMA's answer for New York: Fix up the homes as best they can and put people back in them. Faced with a lack of physical space for FEMA trailers and limited access to available rental apartments and hotels, FEMA officials in New York said they are bent on making flood-soaked homes inhabitable as winter weather moves in. Jersey City takes 1-2 punch . ""New York is a unique housing environment,"" said Michael Byrne, federal coordinating officer for FEMA, on Wednesday. ""We had to come up with something."" The agency's typical approach to disaster relief, such as the widespread use of emergency trailers for displaced residents and long-term rental assistance, doesn't work as well in the Big Apple. Rental housing vacancies across New York City are less than 5%, while holiday season hotel rooms are packed with tourists and travelers, leaving few options for those in need of shelter, authorities said. Adding to the dilemma, crowding persists in the city's public housing units, where more than 160,000 families were on the waiting list before the storm. Can Christie capitalize politically on Sandy? Officials are expected to focus on getting power restored in places where the sheer extent of the electrical damage has made utility companies cautious about reconnecting homes to the power grid. They will also implement structural repairs to make the homes adequate shelters for incoming winter weather. Repairs could include tarps, plastic and plywood. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . FEMA is putting forth ""an essential package of necessary fixes so that people can get back into their homes,"" said Byrne. ""This is not a complete repair."" More than 17,000 households remain without power across New York. That does not include more than 30,000 customers who ""are unable to safely receive power without customer repairs,"" according to the Long Island Power Authority. Long Island residents sue utility . In hard-hit places like the Rockaways and Staten Island, where residents have often clung to their damp homes instead of evacuating, officials said the new program will better cater to the stark realities of the crisis. ""Our home is not that destroyed. We don't have no heat (and) it's very cold in the apartment,"" said Margaret Alvarez, a 41-year-old resident of Far Rockaway, Queens. ""We just need heat, water and electricity."" Residents like Alvarez, whose homes are damaged but not destroyed, are likely FEMA's target customers. But reservations about safety persist. Opinion: Don't rebuild . ""My house shifted about 5 inches,"" said Joanne McClenin, 55, a New Dorp resident of Staten Island. ""We don't know if the quick repair ... is going to be safe enough."" A thicket of downed houses and washed-out roads lines several blocks in the New Dorp area after a torrent of wind and water swept across the coastal neighborhood on October 29. ""I don't know how minor repairs get you back in your home,"" she said. Sandy amplifies struggles for low-income families . Others seemed somewhat encouraged by the federal plan. ""There are a lot of people that don't have their own contractors, so it's a good program for those people,"" said Dawn Nasella, a 41-year-old resident of Staten Island, whose rental property was destroyed in the storm. But the program is not meant to address the needs of those made homeless. That displaced population has mostly inhabited hundreds of city shelters, holed up with friends and family members or taken to living in more perilous places, like their cars. Costs of Sandy in the billions . Meanwhile, signs of normalcy continued to surface across the Tri-State area. But those still in the dark require inspectors to go door-to-door to check individual electrical panels to avoid further damage and potential electrical fires, raising the possibility of a long and cold winter for those still without proper shelter.

"(CNN) -- Traveling in Europe this week, I had a chance to see the world through the eyes of the London Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail. The view from Britain was startlingly different than the view from Martha's Vineyard, where President Obama is vacationing. There is a consensus in Britain that at least 500 young Brits have gone to the Middle East as jihadists. There is a clear belief, stated by Prime Minister David Cameron, that the ISIS fighter who executed journalist James Foley on videotape is British. This harkens back 12 years to the beheading of another American journalist, Daniel Pearl, and the fact that a British-Pakistani has been sentenced to death as one of the perpetrators. The three British newspapers devoted page after page to exploring the scale of British terrorist recruitment, the danger that the terrorists will come home, and clear warnings from the security forces that they will be overwhelmed if they come home in an organized manner. Something profound is happening when a vicious, radical movement can recruit that many young men from a society that was housing, feeding and educating them. This represents a repudiation of the idea of assimilation on a scale and intensity that will lead to profound public policy changes. Cameron cut short his vacation and returned to London for emergency meetings. He indicated quite clearly that he was prepared to expand anti-terrorist policies and make them even more aggressive. It is already illegal in Britain even to look at video such as the beheading of James Foley. This would clearly be unconstitutional in the United States, but it indicates the seriousness with which the British take the threat of radical Islamists. The British have already begun suspending passports of young men who wanted to go to Syria or Iraq. They have also made it illegal to belong to ISIS. President Obama has taken a lot of grief for reading his statement about the killing of James Foley and then going to play golf. At least one newspaper put a picture on its front page of the President laughing in his golf cart next to a picture of Foley's grieving parents. Having now read the President's statement and compared it to the reality of 500-plus young Britons joining ISIS, I think he may have been lucky that people were too irritated by his schedule to pay attention to his statement. I urge you to read President Obama's full text. It isn't very long. The most delusional line is his assertion that ""people like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy."" Of course it is freedom and the rule of law that have been rare throughout history, and tyranny and lawlessness that have been common. ISIS and the ideology it represents won't just wear themselves out. One has to wonder whether the President understands how serious a threat ISIS presents. ISIS is a fact. It is a religiously motivated movement that uses terror as one of its weapons. Beheading people is nothing new in history. ISIS is much more than a terrorist organization. It is making money out of trading in oil and grain. It is making money from robbing banks and selling stolen artifacts. It is running a significant part of Syria and Iraq. More important than ISIS itself is the larger movement it represents. It is recruiting people from many countries. As I have written before, from Boko Haram in Nigeria to Hamas in Palestine to ISIS in Syria and Iraq, we are seeing the same kind of transnational religious radicalism metastasize into a deep commitment to destroy our way of life. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey said, this is ""an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated"" -- and a vision that could ""fundamentally alter the face of the Middle East and create a security environment that would certainly threaten us in many ways."" The British reports on the number of terrorists they are producing and the potential threat they represent should sober all of us. Unfortunately, the Obama administration has no strategy for dealing with a threat of that scale.","Newt Gingrich: At least 500 young Brits have gone to the Middle East as jihadists .

"(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama ""Antichrist."" The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him. Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out. Halloween is nearly upon us, but ""Antichrist"" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called ""Vows of Chastity."" It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, ""Antichrist"" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named. The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.) Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman. Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against ""Hostel,"" ""Saw"" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably. Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: ""Chaos reigns!"" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch. This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance. Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked ""You get what you pay for, folks"" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end. That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more. Beautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, ""Antichrist"" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox. ""Antichrist"" is not rated and runs 104 minutes.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Facing political pressure, Madhav Kumar Nepal announced Wednesday that he is resigning as Nepal's prime minister. In a 20-minute televised address, Nepal said he wanted to avert crisis and find ""political resolution to the peace process and the drafting of the new constitution."" ""Since it is not right to keep the country in a state of indecision and uncertainty, despite having a clear majority in parliament, I have decided to resign today so that the peace process and the constitution drafting process are completed,"" he said. Nepal has endured a fractious political transition since it was declared a republic in 2008 after the abolition of a centuries-old monarchy. This is the third government that has fallen since then. The opposition Maoists, who form the largest party in parliament, have demanded Nepal's resignation as the troubled Himalayan nation prepares a new constitution. Otherwise, the Maoists had threatened to disrupt the parliamentary session and block approval of the annual budget. The failure to adopt a new constitution by the late May deadline would have automatically dissolved the government. But the Maoists agreed to let the government amend the constitution and extend the deadline by a year. In exchange, the Maoists wanted the prime minister to step down so they could lead the government again. The Maoists fought a decade-long insurgency in an effort to topple Nepal's monarchy, leaving more than 13,000 people dead. They signed a peace deal in 2006. Elections in April 2008 made Nepal a republic and dethroned the king. The Maoists were the largest party in the previous coalition government, but their leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal -- commonly known as Prachanda -- resigned as prime minister a year ago because the president overturned his decision to fire a senrio military official. The Maoists declined to join the next coalition government under Nepal's leadership, upset that the government was not making moves to integrate about 19,000 former rebels into the Nepalese army. The government has been reluctant to integrate its former enemies. It's unclear who will succeed Nepal as the next prime minister.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson has officially become the most popular person on Facebook, with more than 7 million fans on the social networking site. The Michael Jackson Facebook page is now the most popular on the social networking site. Previously, the most popular person on Facebook, with just over 6 million fans, was U.S. President Obama. Over the past week, Jackson's page has grown from 80,000 fans to just over 7 million, generating the largest response on a Facebook page, the social networking site says. He has continued to gain about 20 fans per second and even more during peak traffic hours, said social media commentator Nick O'Neill, founder of the Social Times Web site. By comparison, actor Ashton Kutcher recently entered a race to beat CNN's Larry King to 1 million followers on Twitter. Kutcher won and remains the most popular person on Twitter -- but still has only 2.6 million followers. During his memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, all 10 trending topics on Twitter.com were Jackson-related. Jackson's popularity and the viral nature of Facebook fan pages are the primary reasons for the huge fan base, O'Neill explained. He said, ""It's simply his popularity. Also, as users become fans, the page gets recommended to others, driving the viral growth of the page. ""Michael Jackson is simply the largest celebrity in the world. While he was a controversial figure, he clearly attracts the attention of the global media,"" he continued. The Facebook page has become an online memorial to Jackson, with thousands of comments from around the world; dozens appear every minute. Free virtual versions of Jackson's famous glove are the most popular gift on the site, with more than 800,000 sent to members. The huge following leaves the singer's heirs (and his record label) with a massive network to communicate with fans and continue the massive resurgence of interest in Jackson's music, O'Neill said. ""While Sony has not heavily engaged the fan base on Michael Jackson's page, they at least have a presence. If your fans are there, you should be there. ""This also provided an ongoing promotional channel for any future products that are released. It's simply not an option and will become a component of all marketing strategies."" There have been 2.6 million downloads of Jackson's music since his death. He has the top two albums on iTunes, as well as three of the top 10 singles. In the United Kingdom, Jackson held 11 of the top 200 album positions and 43 of the top 200 singles, based on sales monitored by the Official Charts Co. for the week ended June 27. His ""Number Ones"" album topped the OCC album chart after selling 46,400 physical copies and 10,000 downloads. The surge for demand in Jackson's music looks likely to continue for several months: The fan page has a music player with some of Jackson's hits and an option to buy them through Amazon.","Michael Jackson is most popular person on Facebook with nearly 7 million fans .

"(CNN) -- For the serious contenders at grand slams, it's all about trying to advance with minimal fuss in the first week. That way they have plenty of energy left for when the competition picks up in the second week. Serena Williams certainly isn't messing around in the early stages of this year's U.S. Open. After crushing Taylor Townsend -- a potentially tricky opponent -- in the first round in 55 minutes, Williams routed another fellow American, Vania King, 6-1 6-0 in 56 minutes Thursday to reach the third round. Men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic made quick work of his opponent, too, dispatching Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-1 6-3 6-0. This grand slam is big for Williams. Even though she has won 17 majors, none have come in 2014 and she didn't progress to the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. But New York could once again bring Williams joy -- she is the two-time defending champion. The top seed's only problems against King came in her first service game, when Williams hit three double faults in windy conditions. Williams' path to the final got a little easier when Ana Ivanovic was upset by big-serving Czech Karolina Pliskova 7-5 6-4 and Samantha Stosur -- who defeated Williams in the 2011 final -- blew match points and lost to Estonia's Kaia Kanepi in a third-set tiebreak. Ivanovic and Stosur were in Williams' quarter. Just how potent is Pliskova's serve? She trailed only Williams in aces heading into the tournament. Still, it marks more grand slam disappointment for Ivanovic, the eighth seed and a former No. 1. Despite occupying the final spot in the race for the year-end championships, Ivanovic crashed out early at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and now the U.S. Open. ""I do put a lot of expectations on myself,"" Ivanovic told reporters. ""I tried to overanalyze and overthink instead of just playing the game. ""It's a work in process. But I think I have potential to do well"" at grand slams ""and that's something I want to change for next year."" Almost forgotten this year is Victoria Azarenka, since she's missed most of 2014 with a foot injury and this month dealt with a knee complaint. The two-time finalist, however, rallied from a break down in the first set and then cruised past Christina McHale 6-3 6-2. ""It's always going to take time to rebuild,"" Azarenka told reporters. ""I feel like I'm improving day to day. ""I play much better than I played a month ago. So that's important.""","Serena Williams crushes Vania King at the U.S. Open on Thursday .

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)Incoherent. Talking nonsense. Erratic. Not the man they knew. That's how family members and friends have described Eddie Ray Routh, the man on trial for the slayings of Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, at a Texas firing range two years ago. No one disputes that Routh shot and killed the two men. But defense attorneys say Routh was insane. On Wednesday, the suspect's sister, brother-in-law and former girlfriend testified about Routh's behavior before and after the killings. ""I asked him if he was seeing things, and he said yes,"" Jennifer Weed, his ex, told the court, describing a conversation that happened the night before the slayings. ""And then I asked him if he was hearing things, and he said yes."" Weed testified that Routh got out a yellow legal pad and started writing. ""And when I tried to speak to him he would take his hand and cover my mouth because he didn¹t want them to hear what I had to say,"" she said. Routh's demeanor after the killings was equally strange. ""He said he had to take two souls before they could take his. And I asked him what he meant by that, and he said they were out to get him,"" Laura Blevins, his sister, told the court. ""He was talking nonsense."" She said she told him: ""I love you, but I hate your demons."" ""The man who was my brother was not at my house. The person who came to my house is not the man who I knew was my brother,"" Blevins testified. Her husband said that Routh ""babbled about other incoherent things."" ""I had a sick feeling on what it meant,"" Gaines Blevins told the court. Prosecutors have described Routh as a troubled young man, but they argue he wasn't insane; they say these are the actions of a cold-blooded killer. On Tuesday, prosecutors showed a video of police placing Routh into a squad car moments after authorities chased him down a Texas highway. In the video, Routh is breathing heavily and teary-eyed. An officer asks if he's OK. Routh replies: ""I'm just so nervous about what's been happening in my life today. I don't know what's been happening. I've been so paranoid schizophrenic all day. I don't know what to even think of the world right now. I don't know if I'm insane or sane."" The small arsenal of weapons Kyle brought to the range that day was shown to the jury, which included five long rifles and several handguns, including one of Kyle's rifles labeled ""American Sniper."" According to defense attorneys, Routh, in his psychotic state, thought he was walking into a showdown on the range. Taking the stand for the defense, mother Jodi Routh described her son's history of mental health problems. After his time serving in the military, she said, ""he was no longer his happy-go-lucky self."" His first stay in a VA mental ward was for three days in 2011, she said. Then he returned again, against his will, and spent weeks in the facility. When he was released, she said, he was on nine medications, including mood elevators, anti-psychotic medications and sleep aids. Jodi Routh said she had asked Kyle to help, telling him that her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She told Kyle that her son had been hospitalized multiple times, but did not tell him that he'd also threatened to kill himself and his family. ""Do you regret not sharing that level of detail?"" prosecutor Jane Starnes asked. ""I just wanted to get help for my son,"" the mother replied. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, has grossed the most ever for a war movie. Kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. He had already risen to fame through his book when he died and was involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated. A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Eddie Ray Routh's sister says he she told him: ""I love you, but I hate your demons""

"(CNN) -- Gas prices approaching $4 a gallon on average are causing severe economic pain for millions of Americans. Pump prices spiked 5% in the past month alone. Crude oil prices stood at $108 on Friday, up from only double digits at the beginning of the month. What's the cause? Forget what you may have read about the laws of supply and demand. Oil and gas prices have almost nothing to do with economic fundamentals. According to the Energy Information Administration, the supply of oil and gasoline is higher today than it was three years ago, when the national average for a gallon of gasoline was just $1.90. Meanwhile, the demand for oil in the U.S. is at its lowest level since April of 1997. Is Big Oil to blame? Sure. Partly. Big oil companies have been gouging consumers for years. They have made almost $1 trillion in profits over the past decade, in part thanks to ridiculous federal subsidies and tax loopholes. I have proposed legislation to end those pointless giveaways to some of the biggest and most profitable corporations in the history of the world. But there's another reason for the wild rise in gas prices. The culprit is Wall Street. Speculators are raking in profits by gambling in the loosely regulated commodity markets for gas and oil. A decade ago, speculators controlled only about 30% of the oil futures market. Today, Wall Street speculators control nearly 80% of this market. Many of those people buying and selling oil in the commodity markets will never use a drop of this oil. They are not airlines or trucking companies who will use the fuel in the future. The only function of the speculators in this process is to make as much money as they can, as quickly as they can. I've seen the raw documents that prove the role of speculators. Commodity Futures Trading Commission records showed that in the summer of 2008, when gas prices spiked to more than $4 a gallon, speculators overwhelmingly controlled the crude oil futures market. The commission, which supposedly represents the interests of the American people, had kept the information hidden from the public for nearly three years. That alone is an outrage. The American people had a right to know exactly who caused gas prices to skyrocket in 2008 and who is causing them to spike today. Even those inside the oil industry have admitted that speculation is driving up the price of gasoline. The CEO of Exxon-Mobil, Rex Tillerson, told a Senate hearing last year that speculation was driving up the price of a barrel of oil by as much as 40%. The general counsel of Delta Airlines, Ben Hirst, and the experts at Goldman Sachs also said excessive speculation is causing oil prices to spike by up to 40%. Even Saudi Arabia, the largest exporter of oil in the world, told the Bush administration back in 2008, during the last major spike in oil prices, that speculation was responsible for about $40 of a barrel of oil. Just last week, Commissioner Bart Chilton, one of the only Commodity Futures Trading Commission members looking out for consumers, calculated how much extra drivers are being charged as a result of Wall Street speculation. If you drive a relatively fuel-efficient vehicle such as a Honda Civic, you pay an extra $7.30 every time you fill your tank. For larger vehicles, such as a Ford F150, drivers pay an extra $14.56 for each fill-up. That works out to more than $750 a year going directly from your wallet or pocketbook to the Wall Street speculators. So as speculators gamble, millions of Americans are paying what amounts to a ""speculators tax"" to feed Wall Street's greed. People who live in rural areas like my home state of Vermont are hit harder than most because they buy gas to drive long distances to their jobs. It doesn't have to work this way. The current spike in oil and gasoline prices was avoidable. Under the Wall Street reform act that Congress passed in 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was ordered to impose strict limits on the amount of oil that Wall Street speculators could trade in the energy futures market. The regulators dragged their feet. Finally, after months and months of law-breaking delays, the commission in October adopted a rule. It was a weak version of a proposal that might have put meaningful limits on the number of futures and swaps contracts a single trader could hold. Even the watered-down regulation adopted by the industry-friendly commission was challenged in court. The Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association wanted free rein to continue unregulated gambling in the oil markets. So today, Wall Street once again is laughing all the way to the bank. Once again, federal regulators should move aggressively to end excessive oil speculation. We must do everything we can to lower gas prices so that they reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand and bring needed relief to the American people. The time for real action is now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Bernie Sanders.","Bernie Sanders: Speculators cash in by jacking up oil and gas prices; market loosely regulated .

"(CNN) -- Nothing tempts hackers quite like a high-profile new target. A website is offering a bounty of more than $16,000 in cash and other prizes for the first person to successfully hack the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the new iPhone 5S. The site, IsTouchIDHackedYet, was created by Nick DePetrillo, an independent computer-security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones, and Robert David Graham, owner of Errata Security, a cybersecurity firm. It invites donors to contribute to the bounty, which so far includes an assortment of cash, bitcoins (a form of digital currency), several bottles of booze and ""a dirty sex book."" A successful hack of the phone had not been verified as of Monday morning, although a German hackers' group claimed over the weekend to have bypassed the biometric security of the iPhone 5S by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the image to create a fake finger to unlock the phone. They demonstrated their exploits in this video. ""We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token,"" said Frank Rieger, a spokesperson for the group, the Chaos Computer Club, in a post online. How secure is your iPhone 5S fingerprint? According to terms DePetrillo posted on Twitter, to collect the bounty a hacker must lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow them to unlock an iPhone 5S in less than five tries. All the steps must be documented on video. ""The whole point of #istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of Apple's Touch ID security and implementation,"" DePetrillo said Saturday on Twitter. ""I personally believe (for once) a company has implemented a unique feature (Touch ID) in a reasonably secure way,"" he added in another tweet. DePetrillo tweeted Sunday that he had been in contact with the Chaos Computer Club and was ""waiting on a complete video documentation of the process (of their hack) before declaring valid."" The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Apple calls the new security system Touch ID. Phone owners must ""register"" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. Other users' fingerprints will not unlock the phone, which protects it from thieves. The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too. A Minnesota man posted a video Friday to CNN iReport that showed him using the paw of his pet Chihuahua to unlock his new iPhone. DePetrillo and Graham are so-called ""white hat"" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised. Apple did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.","NEW: German hackers' group claims to have hacked the iPhone 5S .

"(CNN) -- After 22 years on death row, Debra Milke is close to freedom. A jury convicted the Arizona woman, now 49, of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, child abuse and kidnapping on October 12, 1990, less than a year after her 4-year-old son was found dead. A judge sentenced her to death a few months later. But those convictions and the related sentence were tossed out Thursday by a federal appeals court judge. In explaining his decision, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals chided the prosecution for remaining ""unconstitutionally silent"" on the ""history of misconduct"" of its key witness, a Phoenix police detective. ""The Constitution requires a fair trial,"" Kozinski wrote. ""This never happened in Milke's case."" A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. That was the plan, she said, when the boy got into the car with Milke's roommate, James Styers. Styers picked up a friend, ""but instead of heading to the mall, the two men drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine, where Styers shot Christoper three times in the head,"" according to Kozinski's summary of the case. Styers was convicted of first-degree murder in the boy's killing and sentenced to death. The detective, Armando Saldate, said the friend told him that Debra Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son. But neither the friend nor Styers testified to that assertion in court. In fact, ""no other witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime"" other than Saldate's testimony. After pleading not guilty, Milke stood trial and tried to convince a jury that her account -- and not the detective's -- was the true one. ""The trial was, essentially, a swearing contest between Milke and ... Saldate,"" said Kozinski. The detective testified he ""didn't buy"" Milke's reaction after he informed her that her son was dead. After that, Saldate said he placed Milke under arrest. In a subsequent interrogation, she confessed that her role in the murder conspiracy was a ""bad judgment call,"" the detective said. But Milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role in a murder plot. There was no recording of the interrogation, no one else was in the room or watching from a two-way mirror, and Saldate said he threw away his notes shortly after completing his report. ""The judge and jury believed Saldate,"" said Kozinski of the verdict and sentence. ""But they didn't know about Saldate's long history of lying under oath and other misconduct."" Specifically, the judge noted that the detective had been suspended five days for taking ""liberties"" with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors; that judges had tossed out four confessions or indictments because Saldate had lied under oath; and that judges suppressed or vacated four confessions because Saldate had violated a person's constitutional rights. ""The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents,"" Kozinski said. ""... There can be no doubt that the state failed in its constitutional obligation."" The judge ordered ""the state"" to turn over Saldate's personnel records to Milke's lawyers, after which ""a police official"" must state under oath that everything has been disclosed and nothing has been ""omitted, lost or destroyed."" Once this is done, a district court must order Milke's release unless prosecutors tell the court within 30 days that they plan to retry her soon. ""In the balance hangs the life of Milke,"" Kozinski said, explaining the importance of his decision to overturn her convictions.","Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death, given the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- The 1970s were the first full decade after civil rights legislation all but obliterated racial segregation in the United States. And it was in large part because of this great sea change that a bright, bold flowering of African-American popular culture affecting music, movies, fashion, television, sports and literature burst forth, its impact resonating with a breadth and force that had never been witnessed before -- or seen since. Don Cornelius, who was found dead Wednesday, at age 75, in his Los Angeles home, was one of the significant figures of this transformative era. As the creator and longtime host of the TV music-and-dance show, ""Soul Train,"" Cornelius took an established broadcast genre of dancing teenagers, hit records and live performances by pop stars and infused it with assertively African-American style and attitude so electrifying that its appeal crossed racial, ethnic and even generational lines. As filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles helped set off the black-movie boom with 1971's ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song""; as Richard Pryor's ribald, so-real-it's-surreal stand-up comedy hit its stride by mid-decade; as Alex Haley's 1976 epic family saga ""Roots"" became the keystone to a nationwide phenomenon whose culminating TV miniseries is still talked about 35 years later, so did Cornelius establish, through ""Soul Train,"" a crucial gauge for pop music's ebb and flow that no one in the entertainment business could ignore. The elite of late-20th century black pop musicians, from Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, James Brown, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Diana Ross and Gladys Knight, to the Jackson Five, O'Jays, Spinners, Gap Band and Commodores took live turns on the ""Train"" -- and frequently delivered some of their more potent televised performances. Eventually, white artists such as Elton John, David Bowie, Sting and Robert Palmer played on the ""Soul Train"" stage. Though he wisely never made himself more conspicuous than the music or the dancers, Cornelius' buttery smooth baritone, colorful attire -- though relatively understated when compared to the dancers' flashy duds -- and avuncular presence provided an anchor for the show's dazzling grooves and slick moves. He also became something of a star himself, making appearances at live concerts and political gatherings looking to share some of the youthful energy he presided over as host from 1970 to 1993. Other TV shows may have had live acts. But if you wanted to know how to move your body to funk, disco and soul music, ""Soul Train"" provided the first and best lesson for much of its long and legendary run. Fred Astaire, in a ""60 Minutes"" interview, said he was a ""Soul Train"" fan. One imagines the great man studying and perhaps even attempting many of those moves. If you were a true dance aficionado, you waited every week for the ""'Soul Train line"" in which improbably limber young couples enacted breathtaking inventories of what would become known as ""breaking"" and ""popping."" Before he became an innovator, the Chicago-born Cornelius sold insurance for Golden State Mutual Life for $250 a week. In 1966, he decided to change his destiny, and reduce his salary by $200, to work as a substitute disc jockey, news reader and interviewer at WVON radio. Within two years, he had acquired enough facility as a broadcaster to secure an on-camera job as sports anchor on Chicago's WCIU-TV show, ""A Black's View of the News."" With his own money, Cornelius produced a pilot episode of an all-black version of Dick Clark's venerable ""American Bandstand"" to be telecast on WCIU. He had trouble interesting sponsors until the locally based Sears Roebuck & Co. expressed interest, believing the show could boost its record sales. The program, dubbed ""Soul Train,"" debuted in 1970, achieving such formidable ratings among the city's black community that it was nationally syndicated the next year. Cornelius not only served as ""Soul Train's"" host, but was also responsible for drumming up advertisers and seeking more stations nationwide. Some of these advertisers were black-oriented companies such as Johnson Products Co., the beauty specialists behind Afro-Sheen hair spray. By mid-decade, ""Soul Train"" had powered its way to more than 100 markets. By the time it ceased production in 2006, after a series of guest hosts, ""Soul Train"" had become one of the longest running syndicated television programs in history. One wonders whether it's possible in this digitized age to build a cultural phenomenon from the ground up as Cornelius did. If so, his example of chutzpah and daring will serve as the template for future dreamers and cultural mavens to follow. That, along with the blend he suavely, fervently prescribed to his audiences week after week at the end of each ""Train"": ""Love! Peace! And -- all together now -- Soul!""

Yucca Mountain -- 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas -- was to be the solution to the U.S. nuclear waste problem: a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states. In 1987, Congress directed the Department of Energy to dispose of waste in the mountain beginning in 1998. But political opposition to the plan has been relentless, and the Energy Department was unable to meet the deadline. In 2008, the Energy Department submitted a license application to the NRC seeking to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, with a goal of opening it in 2017, a date later delayed until 2020. In March of 2009, following the election of President Barack Obama, the secretary of energy announced plans to terminate the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC has argued that the $11 million Congress appropriated for the permit application is insufficient and that Congress will not provide the additional funds necessary to complete the application. The NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board suspended the application until there was enough money to make progress. But in the court's view, the appropriation bill is a mandate by Congress to proceed with the licensing process, regardless of the approval of additional funds that may be needed. ""We would certainly hope that Congress would step in before the current $11.1 million is expended, so as to avoid wasting that taxpayer money. And Congress, of course, is under no obligation to appropriate additional money for the Yucca Mountain project,"" the court order read.","In a 2-1 decision, judges order NRC to approve or reject the permit for the storage project .

"(CNN) -- South African golf was handed another boost on Tuesday when the country was awarded the right to host one of the lucrative World Golf Championships events for the next five years. The news comes after Charl Schwartzel joined 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen as a reigning major champion with his dramatic victory at the Masters on Sunday. ""This is, without doubt, the most significant milestone in the history of professional golf in South Africa,"" Sunshine Tour commissioner Gareth Tindall said on his return from Augusta following meetings with the U.S. PGA Tour and the International Federation of PGA Tours. ""It is something that we have been working on for a long time, and the unanimous support that we have received from the other professional tours around the world confirms the major standing of our players and the Sunshine Tour in world golf. ""What is even more significant is that we have the commitment that we will host this World Golf Championships event for a period of five years. That has enormously positive implications for the game and for our country as a whole."" Can McIlroy conquer the mental minefield? It will be known as the ""Tournament of Hope"" and will try to build awareness of poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa. The three of the four WGC events held in the U.S. have prize money higher than the season's four major tournaments, while the HSBC Champions in China is comparable. The date and venue for South Africa's first staging next year have yet to be announced, but it will feature the top 70 players in the world. Meanwhile, this year's South African Open has been moved back a week to ensure the tournament will not clash with the President's Cup in Australia due to be held from November 17-20, with several players from the country expected to feature in the International team to take on the United States.

"(CNN) -- My parents always told me I could do anything I wanted. They told me I could be anything I wanted if I studied hard, got good grades and treated people well. They were right. They never said to me, however, that I could have it all. The notion that women can have it all, in the way society defines ""all,"" is a ridiculous myth. That's OK. What matters is I have my version of ""all."" What is easy to forget at the core of it is: What do we actually want? Not what does society expect from us. And not what do our mothers and fathers expect from us, though the latter helps shape our fundamental views on this subject. The real question is: What will make us happy? It sounds simple. But it is not simple precisely because there has been so much buildup of expectations from society as to what a good mother and a successful career woman should be. And none of it is based in reality. As a Latina mother of two young children, I have chosen to follow a tough, grueling, demanding, sometimes discriminating, yet very rewarding career in communications, politics, community advocacy and the private sector, beating back cultural pressure to marry and have children in my 20s and early 30s. Sandberg: Speak up, believe in yourself, take risks . To the chagrin of my mother, my own motherhood choices came later in life. I had my first child at age 38, after I was able to carve out quite a bit of career success. This gave me the ability to find an executive position with flexibility and autonomy, which helped ease the burden of guilt and pain when I first left my baby boy -- and later my baby girl -- to go back to work full time. I could not have done any of this without an amazing husband and partner who sacrificed some of his own professional ambitions to partly stay home with our children during their infant years. (What would my old-fashoined machista Colombian father think about that?) But no matter how nurturing and caring husbands are and how much we trust them to fulfill our children's every need, the pangs of a working mother never subside. Guilt pangs, pangs of wanting to be there to not miss a single thing, pangs of letting your children down because you are not at their side every waking minute. For those of us who have chosen to be working moms, the flip side is also true. When you do have the fulfillment of being at home with the kids, there is a slight pang of guilt nudging you to work on that memo, that proposal, read those news stories, think through that new client pitch. Just this week, I left an important annual dinner, full of rich networking opportunities, to be home for my son so he could finish a school project. The concept of ""having it all"" is individual. Maybe it means being all you can be in the choices you have made and ensuring you are doing your best in the role or roles you are carrying out. Maybe it means trying to have one piece at a time. I chose to focus on my career first, to establish myself and then have some flexibility to have a more fulfilling family life. But many women don't want to wait that long to have children, or worse, have waited only to find heartbreak when they try and cannot get pregnant. Some of my childhood friends chose the opposite timing. They had children early and now that their children are grown, they are focusing on fulfilling their professional dreams. Confessions of a busy mom: 5 lessons . Some of my friends have chosen -- gasp! -- to either not have children and focus 100% on their careers or to give up their successful and lucrative professions to dedicate themselves entirely to their families. Both are perfectly fine choices to make. Instead of judging the choices women make, we should rejoice in the fact that we have the ability to make these choices at all. I believe that true feminism does not lie in having to prove that we can be both doting mothers and high-powered career professionals at the same time and do both 100% well 100% of the time. We can't. No one can. Anyone who says differently is lying or not facing reality. The beauty of what the feminist movement has brought today's women is that these choices are available to us. My mother did not have the luxury to choose. She married my father and took care of us. She worked early on as a secretary, and enjoyed it greatly. Then my father demanded she quit to focus on the family. She did. When I found out this family lore, I was outraged, having been brought up by this same mother and father to be an outspoken, independent-minded woman. But then I had to take a step back and realize it was a different time, a different era and a different country. For me and my husband, it is important that in our choices we are setting examples for our kids that it is natural for girls to be strong leaders and for mothers and women to work in demanding careers, and for boys to be nurturers and for dads and men to be the primary care-givers, and vice versa. My hope is that this ""dilemma"" will not even be an afterthought for my daughter. That she will choose what makes her happy. And that will be the definition of ""having it all."" Work, family and 'leaning in': Seven families trying to make it work . We must acknowledge that many women, because of differing circumstances, may not have the luxury to make choices. We are fortunate to live in a country that allows many of us to pave our own way and to make the choices that are best for us, our families, and if we decide to have them, our children. We can embrace our choice, or change it along the way, in the pursuit of happiness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona: The notion that women can have it all is a myth .

"(CNN) -- Arkansas game officials hope testing scheduled to begin Monday will solve the mystery of why up to 5,000 birds fell from the sky just before midnight New Year's Eve. The birds -- most of which were dead -- were red-winged blackbirds and starlings, and they were found within a one-mile area of Beebe, about 40 miles northeast of Little Rock, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said. Birds fell over about a one-mile area, the commission said in a statement. As of Saturday, between 4,000 and 5,000 birds had been found dead, said Keith Stephens with the commission. ""Shortly after I arrived, there were still birds falling from the sky,"" said commission wildlife officer Robby King in the statement. He said he collected about 65 dead birds. The commission said it flew over the area to gauge the scope of the event, and no birds were found outside of the initial one-mile area. Karen Rowe, an ornithologist for the commission, said the incident is not that unusual and is often caused by a lightning strike or high-altitude hail. A strong storm system moved through the state earlier in the day Friday. ""It's important to understand that a sick bird can't fly. So whatever happened to these birds happened very quickly,"" Rowe told CNN Radio on Sunday. ""Something must have caused these birds to flush out of the trees at night, where they're normally just roosting and staying in the treetops ... and then something got them out of the air and caused their death and then they fell to earth,"" Rowe added. Officials also speculated that fireworks shot by New Year's revelers in the area might have caused severe stress in the birds. Rowe said Sunday there was evidence that large fireworks may have played a role. ""Initial examinations of a few of the dead birds showed trauma. Whether or not this trauma was from the force of hitting the ground when they fell or from something that contacted them in the air, we don't know,"" Rowe said. The dead birds will be sent for testing to labs at the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission and the National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin. The necropsies will begin Monday, Stephens said, and the findings should be available sometime this week. The city of Beebe has hired U.S. Environmental Services to begin the cleanup and dispose of the dead birds, the commission said. The firm's workers will go door-to-door and pick up birds still in yards and on rooftops. CNN's Tina Burnside and Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this report.","No birds were found outside of a one-mile area .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- For Cape Town's carnivores, Mzoli's Meat is the city's hippest hangout. The informal butchery and barbeque joint is a place where social and racial barriers are set aside as locals and out-of-towners come together to eat, drink and party. Even celebrity chef Jamie Oliver is a fan, recently describing Mzoli's as ""sexy"" and praising the ""incredible flavor"" of its grilled meat. Also known as Kwa-Mzoli, Mzoli's Place or Mzoli's Butchery, Mzoli's is a meeting place that brings together people from all walks of life. It was opened in 2003 in Gugulethu, a township 15 km from the center of Cape Town, South Africa, when owner Mzoli Ngcawuzele saw a gap in the market. ""We looked at what was missing in the market, especially in our community and we began to say, 'what can really bring people from all walks of life together?' And we came up with this -- Mzoli's,"" Ngcawuzele told CNN. ""You choose your meat, we grill it for you, you've got a table to sit at, and we serve you."" South African winemaker's vintage year . At Mzoli's, diners select their meat from the butchery and then take it to one of the surrounding stalls, where it is grilled over charcoal fires. The locals call it a ""braai,"" the Afrikaans word for barbecue, and a South African specialty. But Mzoli's attracts a clientele hungry for more than just braai. Live music, and DJs playing kwaito and house music draw a diverse crowd, including white South Africans who might not normally make the journey into the black township. Ngcawuzele told CNN, ""We said, 'this is the rainbow nation, how do we manage to bring the rainbow nation together into one spot, where white, black, colored, everyone gets together over a piece of meat?' ""We get a lot of tourists, a lot of the local community, the white community, the colored community. They just come from all walks of life. ""I can tell you now, the racial tensions of the past, that is the past. Today we're moving forward, looking forward from generation to generation. ""Everybody is welcome.

The country's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said there were no reports of problems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant as a result of the earthquake, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- And now, the rejects. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft . Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of ""Air Force One"" flying over New York -- a flight that caused panic on the streets below -- the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight. The photographs show the Boeing VC-25 -- a military version of a 747 -- making three passes by the Statue of Liberty, at one point accompanied by an F-16 fighter jet and at another point making a steep bank not usually seen with passenger aircraft. That latter move may have contributed to the chaos below. The photographs and several lengthy government e-mail chains were released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests by CNN and other news organizations. The e-mail chains show that the flight's government organizers were aware of many New Yorkers' fears of low-flying aircraft before the April 27 flight, and show a flurry of second-guessing, finger-pointing, damage control and occasional expressions of regret in the hours immediately after the flight.  Watch a compilation of still images of the flyover » . ""Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area,"" an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight. ""This is an issue that PAG [the Presidential Airlift Group] has also been concerned with. As a result, their coordination has been substantial."" But while the White House, the military and numerous federal and local government agencies coordinated the flight, the federal government demanded secrecy, preparing a news release that was to be distributed only if there were media inquiries. Those inquiries came during the morning flight, triggering a quick chain of e-mails among government officials. ""We...need to construct some sort of timeline on when folks became aware of it if that is possible,"" one Air Force official wrote, responding to the public interest. ""I agree we... need to accomplish damage control, but we aren't the POC [point of contact],"" the response reads. ""Nor do I want to become a belly button for NORAD to push on this one."" Wrote one top Pentagon spokeswoman: ""Nothing like having everyone point the finger at someone else so we ALL look like a big bunch of buffoons... can you say Moe, Larry & Curly!??!?!"" In addition to the informal e-mail banter, the documents show the regimented system the Pentagon uses to monitor and respond to breaking news stories. A U.S. Northern Command document offers this ""assessment"" of the story: ""Last 4 hours: Story reported quickly. Covered by AP, CNN, FOX major news outlets. Local reporting very critical, highlighting 'scare' factor. Local populace very critical of event, due to 9-11 sensitivities."" It continues: ""Web site blog comments 'furious' at best. Twitter search reveals 'tweets' regarding two F-16's chasing commercial airliner. Rate of 1 tweet per minute and growing."" ""No positive spin is possible. Admit mistake,"" it concludes. In another e-mail, USAF Col. Scott M. Turner, commander of the Presidential Airlift Group, was doing just that. ""Again, my apologies sir. Real intent here was to honor NYC, not cause mass chaos,"" it reads. The next day, the Northern Command's internal memo included depictions of New York's three major tabloids featuring the headlines, ""Scare Force One,"" ""Just Plane Stupid!"" and ""How Dumb Was This!"" The photographs released Friday, meanwhile, show the presidential aircraft making a steep bank, seemingly well beyond the 30-degree maximum for Boeing 747s carrying passengers, according to one airline pilot consulted by CNN. That may have contributed to the anxiety on the ground. The Pentagon estimated the cost of the flight at $328,835, which includes the Boeing aircraft and the two fighter jets that accompanied it. But, they said, ""the hours would have been flown regardless, and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission."" The VC-25 aircraft is designated ""Air Force One"" only when the president is aboard. President Obama was not on the plane during the photo op. After the incident, Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the flyover, resigned. ""I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office,"" Caldera said in a letter to Obama. ""Moreover, it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president. After much reflection, I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office.""","Presidential plane's flight over New York led to panic on ground .

"An Associated Press photographer was shot to death on the eve of Afghanistan's elections in an attack that wounded the news agency's long-time reporter in the region. Anja Niedringhaus, 48, a Pulitzer Prize-winning German photographer, died in the shooting on Friday in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province, the AP said. The attack injured Kathy Gannon, a Canadian reporter based in Islamabad, who was in stable condition and getting medical treatment, according to the AP. Gannon, 60, has reported on Pakistan and Afghanistan since the 1980s. ""Anja and Kathy together have spent years in Afghanistan covering the conflict and the people there,"" said AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll, speaking in New York. ""Anja was a vibrant, dynamic journalist well-loved for her insightful photographs, her warm heart and joy for life. We are heartbroken at her loss."" In a letter to AP staff Friday morning, chief executive Gary Pruitt also praised the courage and skill of Niedringhaus, describing her as ""spirited, intrepid and fearless, with a raucous laugh that we will always remember."" White House comment . At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that the thoughts and prayers of President Barack Obama and the first lady went out to the family of Niedringhaus. He praised the efforts of journalists from Afghanistan and around the world who risked their own safety to cover Saturday's election, the third since the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. The two women were traveling in their own vehicle in a convoy of election workers delivering ballots in Khost province, protected by the Afghan National Army and Afghan police, according to the AP. A unit commander walked up to their car at one point, yelled ""Allahu akbar"" -- ""God is great"" -- and opened fire on them in the back seat, the AP said. The attacker then surrendered to the other police present. The reason for the attack was unclear, but police have arrested the suspected shooter and the case was under investigation, said Baryalay Rawan, a spokesman for the Khost provincial governor. Hours later, a bomb exploded in a polling center in the province's Tanai district, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from where the attack on the journalists occurred, Rawan said. Two people died in the bombing, including Tanai district's deputy police chief, and three were injured, he said. The attacks came amid heightened security for the nation's presidential and provincial elections on Saturday. Afghanistan's election marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country, with current President Hamid Karzai -- who is term-limited by the constitution -- handing over the reins. Karzai was chosen by Afghan leaders to head the country after the fall of the Taliban, and won two subsequent presidential elections in 2004 and 2009. Taliban disruption . The Taliban have vowed to disrupt the elections and punish anyone involved in them. A series of attacks in the capital, Kabul, and elsewhere has marred the run-up to voting. Pakistan's military said Friday that all border crossing points with Afghanistan were closed for Saturday's election. Taliban militants in the mountainous border region have launched attacks in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate to the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing six Afghan police officers, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. A day earlier, a provincial council candidate and nine of his supporters were killed by the Taliban in northern Sar-e-Pul province, said the province's deputy police chief, Sakhidad Haidari. Last month, Sardar Ahmad, one of Afghanistan's most prominent journalists and a senior reporter for Agence France-Presse, was among nine people killed in an attack on the Serena Hotel in central Kabul. Less than two weeks earlier, Swedish Radio correspondent Nils Horner was shot dead in broad daylight on a Kabul street. In his letter to AP staff, Pruitt said: ""As conflict spreads throughout regions of the world, journalism has become more dangerous. Where once reporters and photographers were seen as the impartial eyes and ears of crucial information, today they are often targets."" The Committee to Protect Journalists highlighted the risks faced by journalists in Afghanistan, particularly women, in a piece published in February. Some fear those risks may increase with the planned withdrawal of NATO combat forces, including U.S. troops, by the end of the year. Changed mission? The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force had just over 51,000 troops, from 48 different countries, in Afghanistan as of Tuesday. The majority -- about 33,500 -- are from the United States. Karzai has refused to sign an agreement to keep foreign security troops in the country after 2014. But Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week that he anticipates international forces will remain in Afghanistan after the currently scheduled withdrawal. ""I think you will see a very large ISAF combat mission changed to a smaller but continued resolute support, train, advise and assist mission at the end of the year,"" he said. ""NATO's mission doesn't end (after 2014); NATO's combat mission ends, but our train, advise, assist mission begins, and this is very important to remember."" The three leading presidential candidates -- Abdullah Abdullah, Zalmai Rassoul and Ashraf Ghani -- have told CNN that they are in favor of signing a security agreement. Abdullah, who was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, was a previous Karzai ally and served in his government as foreign minister. Contenders . In later years, he has been a thorn in the side of the outgoing President. He is seen as a relatively liberal candidate and advocate of women's engagement in public life. Rassoul is seen as the establishment candidate. A Karzai ally, he received the backing of the current President's brother, Qayum, who withdrew his candidacy and endorsed the former foreign minister. Rassoul has a reputation for honesty, despite his years in an administration plagued with accusations of graft. The third key contender, Ghani, is a former U.S. citizen and academic who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He is seen as a moderate, with experience in development, but his past links to the United States may lessen his chances if voters consider him an outsider. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, speaking Wednesday in Belgium, said the latest briefings from NATO commanders show that despite the Taliban's threats, overall violence across Afghanistan ""is lower now than at any time during the last two years."" Rasmussen praised the work of Afghan security forces, which have taken over many responsibilities from ISAF, saying they had ""demonstrated commitment, courage and professionalism"" during preparations for the elections.","Pakistan military increases border security with Afghanistan for election .

"(CNN) -- Indonesia celebrated a unique birth this weekend in the form of a baby Sumatran rhino -- only the fifth known to have been born in captivity ever. The rare arrival took place at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra province, making Indonesia the third country to have successfully bred the species in captivity. There are less than 200 Sumatran rhinos remaining in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), making it the most endangered of all rhino species. Aside from a dozen or so in Malaysia's Sabah province, the Sumatran rhinos reside in three national parks in Indonesia. The critical endangered species is most threatened by poaching for its horns and destruction of its natural habitat. These factors have contributed to an estimated reduction in its numbers of more than 50% over the last two decades, the IRF said. The father of Indonesia's newborn calf is actually one of three Sumatran Rhinos bred in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in the United States. Andalus was born in 2001, some 112 years after the first known captive birth at Calcutta Zoo in India in 1889. Saturday's birth was welcomed by rhino conservationists, following two miscarriages by Andalas' partner, Ratu, since their pairing in 2009.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Laura Hathaway initially had no regrets after getting a tattoo on her lower back when she was 21. But now, 10 years later, she wants it gone. Tattoo removal is more painful than the original tattoo, patient Laura Hathaway says. The pharmaceutical sales representative from Atlanta, Georgia, says it doesn't fit in with her current lifestyle as the mother of a 2-year-old boy who just started to talk. ""The other day I bent over and he said, 'What's that?' and it just confirms why I'm having it removed."" Dr. Scott Karempelis of Atlanta Dermatology Associates is performing a multitreatment laser procedure that will gradually erase Hathaway's tattoo with little or no scarring. The process is painful, expensive and time-consuming. Karempelis says that in spite of the drawbacks, ""business is booming."" He and three other dermatologists in his office see more than 30 patients a day who want tattoos removed by laser.  Watch Hathaway's tattoo beginning to disappear » . The American Academy of Dermatology reports tattoo regret is common in the United States. Among a group of 18- to 50-year-olds surveyed in 2004, 24 percent reported having a tattoo and 17 percent of those considered getting their tattoo removed. Karempelis uses a state-of-the-art laser that targets the pigment in the tattoo. ""It goes through the skin without damaging it and hits the pigment depending on which wavelength and which color you have, and it blows it into small pieces."" The tattoo ink is then reabsorbed into the body through the lymphatic system. The process must be completed over several sessions in order to protect the skin from damage. Hathaway expects to go through 10 sessions several weeks apart, each lasting less than a minute. She admits it's a lot more painful than getting the original tattoo. ""It's prickly,"" describes Hathaway. ""It feels like a bee is sitting on your back stinging time and time again. Afterwards, the pain does go away and you're a little sore for a few hours."" Patients with bigger tattoos are sometimes given the option to use a topical anesthetic, but Karempelis points out that it adds to the cost. Like other dermatologists, he charges by the square inch for the laser treatment. By the time Hathaway's done, she expects to pay more than $2,200. There's no guarantee that she won't have a scar. ""Scarring is your major risk,"" says Karempelis. ""Almost everyone gets a little bit of discoloration, a little lighter, a little darker for a while. But in most cases if you wait a year, you cannot see where it was done initially."" Certain tattoo colors, such as green, yellow and purple, are harder to remove, Karempelis says, especially for people with darker skin. Some parts of the body also pose a challenge. ""The farthest away from the heart are hardest to treat, so the ankles are the toughest,"" Karempelis says. He predicts his business will increase in the future, after a new type of tattoo ink hits the market. Freedom-2 is a microencapsulated dye. It's designed to be easily removed by a single laser treatment. ""The laser would hit that pigment and it would completely dissolve immediately. ... You wouldn't need repetitive treatments,"" the doctor says.

"(CNN) -- We all have weird, irrational concerns. So, if you're just staring at your walls, drowning in fear that the great Tom Hanks may never release a digital typewriter app for your iPad, then this one is for you. Because it finally exists. I'm just not exactly sure why. But, the new Hanx Writer app definitely looks, acts, and sounds just like a real typewriter, all nestled within the technological convenience of your amazing, space-age digital tablet. The one you bought to replace your laptop. Which you bought to replace your desktop. Which we all bought to replace our typewriters when we realized we were living in the '80s and didn't have to deal with this crap anymore. Speaking of which, did you know the decline of typewriters can directly be traced to the rise of the British pop music duo, Wham!. Coincidence? Yes. Totally. Completely. It's just that I sort of got sucked into an Internet information wormhole, and that was my major takeaway. Typewriters went out. Wham! came in. Serious journalism. Anyway, I really don't mean to be critical of anyone's interest in outdated typewriters. Or even modern, pretend digital typewriters. After all, both are great if you enjoy that warm, old-world feel of seemingly irreversible mistakes. ""Dave, you misspelled seven words."" ""Whatever. It's not like it's the Torah."" ""No, it's your resume."" As for me, it's just too much trouble. I'm simply not hipster enough to fully appreciate a device that somehow makes it more difficult to write 700 words about not wearing pants. That kind of art requires only the very best modern technology. And a weird childhood. But long-form writing really isn't the point of the Hanx Writer, for it serves a completely different purpose. Digital nostalgia. And it's a hit. As I'm writing this on Thursday night, the Hanx Writer sits proudly as the No. 1 free iPad app in the iTunes store. Behold! The awesome power of Tom Hanks! He managed to take something from your parents' garage, and put it right on your iPad. But what I really find funny is the iTunes category: Productivity. Sorry, Mr. Hanks. I do appreciate the inventiveness of your app and your passion for the medium, however let's not kid ourselves. It's anything but productive. Unless, of course, your goal for the day is to make multiple spelling and punctuation mistakes. In which case, it"" s f&9#ing greatgdzfg!.; . To be fair, it does have a few necessary conveniences, like a setting which allows you to use ""modern delete."" It also provides for copy-paste. So, it's sort of a combination of old and new. Users can enjoy the feeling of a typewriter while still processing words digitally. The idea is that what you make will feel to you, and look to your reader, like something more personal than an e-mail or a text message. And Hanks argues that kind of personalization shines best through a typewriter. Even a digital one. The Oscar-winning actor is actually a huge aficionado of typewriters. A year ago, he even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about why he loves them so much. Amazingly, Hanks says he uses a manual typewriter almost every day. He wrote: ""Everything you type on a typewriter sounds grand, the words forming in mini-explosions of SHOOK SHOOK SHOOK. A thank-you note resonates with the same heft as a literary masterpiece."" Maybe so. ""Sarah, thanks for being my beautiful maid of honor on such a special day for me and Brad. I'm sorry you threw up in the hotel lobby."" And maybe not. Now, for what it's worth, this column was crafted (ha!) over the span of two days using two different computers. During that time, I paused to read more of Hanks' op-ed. And, despite my earlier cynicism, I admit that I now better understand the appeal. Dammit, Tom Hanks. Why do you have to be so charming? So, yeah, I'm sort of sold on the idea that an old typewriter might tap into your creativity in a different way. Which is why they put a lot of thought into making this app. Pulling from Hanks' vast personal collection, the app's developer, Hitcents, created several totally original vintage-style typewriter choices. One of these comes standard with the app. The others are available for purchase. And each types with a completely different style. With the help of Hanks, they literally studied the ink patterns of these old typewriters, and digitally recreated the typefaces within the app. Thus, if you're not working on anything too serious as a final draft, and if you want to explore your creativity and communication in a different, perhaps even more personal, way, the Hanx Writer might just be the app for you. Maybe so. ""Sarah, we just got a bill from the hotel."" And maybe not. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Yani Tseng's two-year reign at the top of women's golf is over. Five-time major winner Tseng has been at the top of the Rolex World Rankings since February 2011, but the Taiwanese star has finally been usurped by American Stacy Lewis. Lewis produced an eight-under-par final round of 64 to clinch the Founders Cup in Phoenix Arizona, just two weeks after winning the HSBC Women's Champions event in Singapore. The Ohio native is only the second U.S. player to occupy the coveted berth after Cristie Kerr also reached the top in June 2010. Lewis clawed back a three-stroke deficit to Japan's Ai Miyazato to eventually finish three shots ahead of the former world No. 1. The final round's 16th hole proved decisive, with Miyazato slipping and allowing Lewis to take control. ""It's awesome,"" Lewis told the LPGA Tour's official website when asked about the win. ""I played great today. Myself and Ai we just went back and forth all day; she was making putts, I was making putts. ""I was certainly surprised she finished the way she did, but to make those two putts I did on 16 and 17 was pretty unbelievable and I'm just really speechless."" If Lewis' fightback at the Wildfire Golf Club journey was stirring, it is nothing compared to the story of her rise to the top. A decade ago the 2011 Kraft Nabisco Championship winner underwent surgery for scoliosis, following a childhood plagued by back problems. ""Yeah, it's almost 10 years ago I was having surgery, I was going into surgery to put a rod and five screws in my back,"" added Lewis. ""That's not normal, that's not supposed to happen. I mean, I'm not really supposed to be here. ""I know that there's a reason and I know that everything happens for a reason. Every setback you have along the way, everything good that happens, it all happens for a reason. ""I couldn't have dreamed the kid growing up wearing a back brace 18 hours a day that is the No. 1 player in the world. I don't know, I don't know what to say.""

"(CNN) -- It was one of the worst genocides since the Nazi era. The brutal Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975 and terrorized the population for four years, killing more than one million people. One of its infamous leaders died Thursday, escaping judgment for war crimes at the hands of a U.N. tribunal. Ieng Sary passed away in the capital Phnom Penh at age 87, the United Nations-backed court for Cambodia said. He was the foreign minister under, and the brother-in-law-of, Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot. On Tuesday, he was hospitalized for stomach pains. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia -- the U.N.-backed court -- will establish the cause of death before releasing his body to his family. Ieng Sary's death leaves just two defendants facing judgment by the tribunal. His wife, Ieng Thirith, was excluded from the case after she was deemed unfit to stand trial in September 2012. But charges of torture and murder will continue against the remaining defendants -- former nominal head of state Khieu Samphan and former prime minister Nuon Chea. Proceedings halted . Following Ieng Sary's death, Amnesty International asked the court to continue with its proceedings without delay. ""The news of Ieng Sary's death will be difficult for the victims of the Khmer Rouge crimes who have waited so long for justice,"" said Rupert Abbott of the human rights group. The court has faced criticism that it has proceeded too slowly with the trial. The defendants are more than 77 years old, and more of them could die before facing judgment. On Tuesday, proceedings came to a grinding halt after local staffers walked out, saying they will not return until they are paid wages owed by the cash-strapped court for the last three months. A bloody period . Pol Pot came to power as a communist revolutionary after toppling the U.S. backed government in Phnom Penh, when American troops left the region in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam war. For the next four years, the communist Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot was blamed for the deaths of some 1.7 million people through torture, execution, hard labor and starvation. Pol Pot's rule became known as the era of the killing fields when cities were emptied and residents slaughtered. A Vietnamese invasion in 1979 forced the Khmer Rouge to retreat back to the jungle. The dictator died in 1998 before the tribunal's existence and never faced trial. Double jeopardy? The Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia quickly put Ieng Sary on trial and convicted him in absentia in 1979. When he defected from what remained of the broken Khmer Rouge regime in 1996, the Cambodian king pardoned him. The defense for Ieng Sary once argued that the case against him should be dismissed on grounds of double jeopardy -- a defendant cannot be tried twice for the same crime. The court considered the motion. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report .","He escapes justice for alleged genocide .

"(CNN) -- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, delivering Thursday's commencement speech at Harvard University, criticized what he described as a disturbing trend of liberals silencing voices ""deemed politically objectionable."" ""This spring, it has been disturbing to see a number of college commencement speakers withdraw -- or have their invitations rescinded -- after protests from students and -- to me, shockingly -- from senior faculty and administrators who should know better,"" Bloomberg said. The billionaire former mayor cited an October speech during which his ex-police commissioner, Ray Kelly, was shouted down by students at Brown University. The university canceled Kelly's speech when protesters opposed to the police department's stop-and-frisk policy shouted down and interrupted Kelly. Bloomberg noted other universities have had speakers back out. He pointed to Rutgers, where former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice withdrew amid protests, and Smith College, where International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde withdrew after a student petition. ""In each case, liberals silenced a voice -- and denied an honorary degree -- to individuals they deemed politically objectionable. This is an outrage,"" Bloomberg said to applause. An even more glaring example of failing to listen to the opposing side, Bloomberg said, was the longstanding impasse between Republicans and Democrats in Washington, where every major question facing the nation is decided ""not by engaging with one another but by trying to shout each other down."" Bloomberg, who in April pledged $50 million to gun control groups he helped organize, spoke about Washington politicians' handling of gun issues, noting Congress has barred the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting studies of gun violence, a prohibition that was recently extended to the National Institute of Health. ""What are they afraid of?"" he asked. The Senate this year delayed a vote on President Obama's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, because the Harvard physician ""had the audacity to say gun violence is a public health crisis that should be tackled,"" Bloomberg said to applause. ""Let's get serious: When 85 Americans are killed with guns every single day, and shootings regularly occur at our schools and universities, including last week's tragedy at Santa Barbara, it would be almost medical malpractice to say anything else,"" Bloomberg said. The former mayor, who received honorary degrees from Harvard along with seven others -- including former President George H.W. Bush and music icon Aretha Franklin -- spoke of the role of universities as places where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely debate ideas without that ""sacred trust"" being threatened by the ""tyrannical tendencies of monarchs, mobs and majorities."" He recalled when protesters came out several years ago against the development of a mosque a few blocks from ground zero in lower Manhattan. ""We protected their right to protest,"" Bloomberg said. ""But they could not have been more wrong. And we refused to cave in to their demands. The idea that government would single out a particular religion, and block its believers -- and only its believers -- from building a house of worship in a particular area is diametrically opposed to the moral principles that gave rise to our great nation, and the constitutional protections that have sustained it."" He added, ""If you want the freedom to worship as you wish, to speak as you wish, and to marry whom you wish, you must tolerate my freedom to do so -- or not do so -- too. What I do may offend you. You may find my actions immoral or unjust. But attempting to restrict my freedoms in ways that you would not restrict your own leads only to injustice."" Bloomberg compared the intolerance of ideas prevalent in the country today to ""McCarthy's Red Scare"" in the 1950s and its destruction of thousands of lives. In the 2012 presidential race, he said, the overwhelming majority of campaign contributions from Ivy League faculty went to Barack Obama. ""Today, on many college campuses, it is liberals trying to repress conservative ideas, even as conservative faculty members are at risk of becoming an endangered species,"" he said. After the speech, Sarah Surrain, who completed her master's degree in education, said Bloomberg was bold to criticize universities as too liberal. ""I thought it was really thoughtful,"" she said of the speech. ""It was nice that it wasn't just platitudes."" Harvard Law School graduate Jared Nicholson said the speech was ""a great message ... about tolerance of different ideas and diversity of opinions."" Greg Silverberg, an engineering school graduate, said he welcomed the former mayor's viewpoint. ""He gave some interesting perspectives on conservative views in universities that I hadn't heard before coming from a liberal undergraduate institution myself,"" he said. ""It was eye-opening for a lot of people."" Before the speech, Cary Williams, president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, questioned why Bloomberg was selected as speaker, because, she said, the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program ""disproportionately has targeted people of color in New York."" ""It's basically racial profiling,"" junior Keyanna Wigglesworth said of the New York policing policy under Bloomberg. ""And so it's unsettling to me, (for) someone to speak who advocates a racist policy when you want students of color on campus to feel comfortable. It's confusing and I don't think its what Harvard stands for."" CNN's Laura Dolan and Dana Garrett contributed to this report.","Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg blasts what he calls silencing of ideas .

"(CNN) -- A partnership between NASA's Kennedy Space Center and Boeing will bring more than 100 jobs to Florida's Space Coast, the governor announced on Monday. ""Florida has five decades of leadership in the space industry, which makes our state the logical place for the next phase of space travel and exploration,"" Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement. Boeing's plans include manufacturing and testing its Crew Space Transportation-100 spacecraft and locating its Commercial Crew program headquarters at Cape Canaveral. The move is expected to create 140 jobs in Florida by June 2013 and 550 by December 2015. Republican Rep. Sandy Adams called the announcement ""welcomed news"" as she recounted the devastating job losses her 24th Congressional District has suffered since the space shuttle program ended. It was a little more than a year ago that NASA laid off more than 1,200 workers, even after a bill that extended the retirement date of the shuttle program from February to July 2011. Thousands more, including shuttle workers and contractors, lost their jobs when the program ended. Despite the massive job losses, state and federal leaders have worked hard to preserve the history of the space center and produce new jobs that will secure economic growth for years to come. ""This marks the beginning of the vibrance of the economy of the Space Coast,"" Republican Rep. Bill Posey said. NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Beth Garver thanked the Obama administration and Congress for their support and called the agreement ""the latest sign of tangible progress"" as the space center transitions from a government-only facility to a commercial space port. The partnership is ""also part of a larger commitment on the part of NASA and the Obama administration to bring jobs and economic development to the Space Coast by building on all of Kennedy's world-class launch capabilities,"" Garver said. ""The Boeing Co. is helping lead the way in the next chapter of human spaceflight, and I am proud that they chose our community for their home,"" Adams said. The CST-100 spacecraft is a reusable capsule-shaped aircraft that has a crew module and service module, a statement from the governor said.

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso stretched his lead in the world championship standings with a peerless drive from pole position to win the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim Sunday. The 30-year-old Spaniard was claiming his third victory of the season for Ferrari after wins in Malaysia and the European Grand Prix. He came home just under four seconds clear of the two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull. But Vettel was demoted to fifth for running off the track as he overtook McLaren's Jenson Button on the penultimate lap of 67. He was handed a 20 second penalty by race stewards to leave Britain's Button in second place and Finland's Kimi Raikkonen (Lotus-Renault) in the final podium position. Kamui Kobayashi of Japan was promoted to fourth, with Mexican teammate Sergio Perez (Sauber) in sixth. Home hero and seven-time champion Michael Schumacher was seventh for Mercedes ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber, who lost ground in the title race. German Nico Hulkenberg, who was ninth for Force India, and his compatriot Nico Rosberg, in the second Mercedes, completed the points scoring. 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) saw his title chances further recede after being forced to retire after a puncture picked up from track debris. It followed an early collision between Ferrari number two Felipe Massa and Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Lotus. For Alonso, a third world title beckons after stretching his lead to 34 points over Australia's Webber, with Vettel in third, but 10 points further adrift. ""We'll enjoy the win,"" said Alonso. ""Starting on pole was the key factor because it was difficult to overtake and we were not the fastest but we kept the position."" Vettel told the post-race press conference that he had not intended to hinder Button as he overtook the Briton. ""The last thing you want to do is make contact. When we were side-by-side, I tried to give him enough room -- but it's difficult to see. ""I went wide. We were all struggling with tires, Jenson in particular, which is why I was able to pass him.""","Fernando Alonso wins German Grand Prix at Hockenheim .

"(CNN) -- The financial crisis has driven a wedge through Europe, with two economies emerging and -- more dangerously -- a psychological split between the north and the south, European leaders have told CNN. Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank, Mario Monti, former prime minister of Italy, and Joaquin Almunia, EU competition commissioner, joined CNN's Richard Quest to debate if the crisis had fractured the region, both economically and socially. Trichet, who headed France's Banque de France before joining the ECB, said a two-speed economy was emerging, but that could be seen as a ""major rebalancing."" When he began at the ECB in 2003, Germany was the sick man of Europe due to its lack of competitiveness, Trichet said. The country has since emerged as the eurozone's power player, and a lead negotiator in the four-year old financial crisis. According to Trichet, Europe has been adjusting after ""countries that went too far too rapidly, had bubbles and so forth...now those countries that were growing extremely fast, abnormally fast, [and] a lot of them are correcting."" However, member countries are not always going at the ""same time, at the same speed,"" Trichet said. Monti who stepped up as Italy's ""technocrat"" prime minister after the country's economic instability forced the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi, told Quest his greater concern was the prospect of a two class Europe. READ MORE: Could euroskeptics spoil Angela Merkel's party? ""The crisis has been managed very, very poorly in my view as regards the psychology, and the eurozone crisis has generated a backlash against integration,"" Monti said. This ""psychological conflict of north versus south and vice versa, this needs to be tackled."" Trichet echoed the concerns, telling Quest such a split was ""absolutely unacceptable."" ""If we had, in the past, fully implemented the rules including the stability and growth pact, and what was badly needed -- control and monitoring of competitiveness -- we wouldn't have two class Europe,"" he said. Almunia, meanwhile, said his fear was that ""after the crisis those who were, at the beginning of this crisis, at the bottom, would continue to be at the bottom."" However, he added, that would not happen if the countries in recession ""do what they have started to do and ....continue to do [it]."" Germany's emergence as power player . Germany emerged as an economic force after labor reforms were implemented under its then-chancellor Gerhard Schroder. Now, its export-led economy drives the 17-nation eurozone, with Chancellor Angela Merkel -- battling for third term in this weekend's federal elections -- a central figure during Europe's crisis. Merkel's popularity remains high in Germany, and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, is expected to gain the most votes. Merkel's leadership during the crisis saw her named as the world's most powerful woman by Forbes three years in a row. Efforts to combat the crisis included the implementation of bailout funds, closer fiscal cooperation and austerity measures. READ MORE: It's the economy, Dummkopf . When asked if Germany is taking over Europe, Monti replied that the continent's largest economy would have more dominance if it had retained the deutsche mark ""because they would then become the only relevant monetary policy power in Europe."" As it is, Germany remains shackled to the weaker countries in the euro, many of which continue to struggle with spiralling unemployment, high national debts and growing political instability. Greece, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland have received over 400 billion euros ($534 billion) in bailout packages from the euro-area's rescue funds. Last year European finance ministers approved a 39.5 billion euro ($51.6 billion) lifeline for Spain's banks, struggling after the property bubble went bust. Yet Spain and Greece still have unemployment above 27%. Portugal and Ireland are also struggling with chronic unemployment. Anti-austerity protesters in the worst-hit nations have held demonstrations against government cuts and the lack of jobs, with many turning violent. And Eurostat's 2013 growth forecasts for eurozone nations show a growing chasm between the region's prosperous north and its struggling south. READ MORE: German Finance Minister, on the campaign trail . Germany is expected to post 0.4% growth this year while all the Mediterranean countries' economies are likely to contract. The imbalance had created a system ""where the creditor nations rule and impose their conditions and the others are subservient to that,"" Paul de Grauwe, a professor at the London School of Economics, told CNN. ""At some point, these countries will not continue to accept this recipe."" The common currency's future . Public opinion continues to support the political push to integrate the eurozone, Almunia said. Discontent shown by the region's constituents is ""with the way the European institutions tried to solve the problems,"" he said. Indeed, despite efforts to tie the bloc closer, debate continues around the potential for worst affected countries to exit the common currency. Such an outcome has been decried in the past but could, according to European School of Management and Technology faculty member Jan Hagen, be of benefit. Hagen said the bloc needed to ""go for strong political integration, to basically create a single market or a strong fiscal policy, or get rid of the euro. "" Otherwise, Hagen said, ""my fear is .... people in these countries that have problems will turn violently against Europe."" Meanwhile, according to Monti, the region's leaders must work more closely together. Leaders who applaud decisions made in Brussels only to criticize them from home turf are playing a dangerous game, he said. ""This Europe bashing is, of course, very dangerous... because it's simply a dishonest game of shifting the responsibility where it does not belong,"" Monti told Quest. And, as Trichet noted during the debate: ""This is no time for complacency for Europe... it's absolutely clear we have very hard work to do, very, very hard work, and things will remain difficult for a while.""

"London (CNN) -- Monkeys and bananas. It's as natural a pairing as squirrels and nuts or movies and popcorn. Not any more, says one zoo in southwest England. Paignton Zoo in Devon is grabbing bananas out of its monkeys' hands, giving them leafy veggies and sprouts instead. This is no monkey-business diet fad, though. The zoo says the high calorie and sugar content of bananas grown for human consumption -- which are sweeter than those found in the wild -- are bad for the monkeys' health and can rot their teeth. ""Bananas grown for human consumption are full of sugar and calories, and bear no relation to fruit grown organically,"" said zoo spokesman Philip Knowling. ""Life in the wild is hard work and in a zoo you can sometimes look after the animals too well and it isn't good for their health."" Thicker, better fur . Humans can continue gobbling up their bananas, just keep them away from monkeys. ""Sweet and juicy bananas are good for humans but not for monkeys,"" Knowling said. ""Animal nutrition has become a problem. Bananas and monkeys is a bit of a cliche, but they're not a good combination."" The zoo has not been able to find a supplier for the kind of wild-grown bananas that would be more suitable for the monkeys, he said. So, it decided it was time to put them back on the shelf. The zoo has seen ""definite changes"" in the monkey's behavior since the bananas were slowly withdrawn from their diet, Knowling said. ""We've noticed a net improvement in their coat and their fur is thicker and better. Some of the smaller monkeys are less aggressive,"" he said. Thailand's annual 'monkey buffet' Diabetes risk . According to the zoo's head of conservation, Amy Plowman, the bananas' high sugar content could cause the monkeys to develop diabetes or similar conditions. ""It can also cause gastrointestinal problems as their stomachs are mostly adapted to eating fibrous foods with very low digestibility,"" she said. Zoos are getting smarter in the way they feed their captive animals. Rather than throw in ready chopped and prepared food, many now try to make the animals ""work"" for their calories by searching for scattered foodstuffs or doing puzzles to release treats. This is just the next step, Plowman said. Knowling said there was no obvious sign that the monkeys were missing the fruit. In fact, they could well be happier without the extra sugar.

"(CNN) -- While Sen. Barack Obama has campaigned on a message of hope, his wife, Michelle, has talked about the realities of American life -- the gaps between rich and poor, black and white. Sen. Barack Obama has spoken out against criticism of his wife, Michelle. She's publicly criticized the United States as ""guided by fear"" and ""just downright mean."" The woman known as ""the rock"" in the Obama family will now appear before the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, on Monday  -- and before the world -- with a clear message: ""One Nation."" But will Michelle Obama -- who could be the nation's first African-American first lady -- carry a theme of unity in light of controversial comments she's made on the campaign trail that resulted in speculation about her patriotism? Aides in the Obama campaign say she's already honing her message for the fall. ""Michelle wrote her own stump [speech]. And you know, she's refining it now, I think, as we're going into the general election,"" said Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser. ""We have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver. So she's really working on it as we speak."" Her new speeches will include more details about her family and humble upbringing on Chicago's South Side, aides say. Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, 44, was born in Chicago, Illinois. She attended Princeton University and then went on to Harvard Law School. She later became a vice president at the University of Chicago and landed a job as a health care executive making $275,000 a year. Barack, Michelle and their two daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, live on the South Side of Chicago. But along with her success has come criticism. Robin Givhan, fashion editor with The Washington Post, told CNN that people see Michelle Obama in different ways. ""Some people will see confidence, and others might see cockiness. I think some people will see strength. Others might see arrogance,"" she said. ""She comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with."" Behind the scenes, she maintains that independence. But with the election just months away, the potential first lady is trying to connect with voters on a more personal level. In June, she made an appearance as a guest co-host on ABC's ""The View,"" and later, she and her husband graced the cover of Us Weekly. The magazine, headlined ""Michelle Obama: Why Barack Loves Her,"" included details about her love for Target, ""Sex and the City"" and her daughters' recitals. Asked on ""The View"" if she's going through a makeover, she said she realizes that ""I wear my heart on my sleeve"" and that ""it's a risk you have to take."" She said she thinks people will change their perception of her as they see her family more. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a first ladies historian, told CNN that it's important for Michelle Obama to define herself before others define her. ""One comment made off-hand ... might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition,"" he said in June. Michelle Obama saw that in February when a Tennessee Republican ad used a snippet from a campaign event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There, while referring to record voter turnout in the Democratic primaries, she said, ""for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country."" The Obama campaign called the ad ""shameful,"" and it was condemned by the state's two Republican U.S. senators. But the ad's message caught on in conservative blogs -- and later forced Michelle Obama to clarify her remarks. ""What I was clearly talking about is that I am proud in how Americans are engaging in the political process,"" she responded. ""I mean, everyone has said what I said, in that we haven't seen these record numbers of turnouts, people who are paying attention, going to rallies, watching debates."" Cindy McCain, the wife of Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also took a shot at Michelle Obama at the time, saying, ""I am proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier. I am very proud of my country."" More recently, controversy erupted over a July 13 New Yorker magazine cover showing Barack Obama in the Oval Office dressed in traditional Muslim attire, and Michelle Obama with an Afro hairstyle and a machine gun slung over her back. An American flag can be seen burning in the fireplace, and a picture of Osama bin Laden hangs on the wall. Shortly after the magazine was published, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton called the cover ""tasteless and offensive."" John McCain later said it was ""totally inappropriate."" But the overall issue of Michelle Obama as a potential liability has made headlines on both coasts -- with articles in both The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times in early June. The newspapers pointed to relentless online rumor mills, criticism on conservative blogs and articles in conservative magazines, like the National Review, critical of Michelle Obama. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote in June that the backlash against Michelle Obama was a ""good preview of how Republicans will attack Michelle, suggesting that she does not share American values, mining a subtext of race."" Conservatives view the presumptive Democratic nominee's wife as a target of opportunity. But one Republican consultant has said attacks on candidates' wives often backfire. ""Considering there are so many issues -- legitimate issues -- that you can use on Barack Obama, to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidity of the highest level,"" Stephen Marks, a Republican strategist, told CNN in June. ""Mr. Obama is going to come to his wife's defense, and it's going to humanize both of them."" Republican strategists say the wife of the Democratic presidential nominee is fair game. ""There is less information about him to temper her comments against, so what she says represents something a lot more important than perhaps other candidates in the past who have had a longer track record,"" Rachel Marsden, a Republican strategist, also told CNN. The potential first lady, however, appears to be bracing for what may lie ahead. ""We're trusting that the American voters are ready to talk about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing to do with making people's lives better,"" Michelle Obama told ABC News during a joint interview in May. But Barack Obama quickly added, ""I also think these folks should lay off my wife.""

"(CNN) -- Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S. Carona, once dubbed ""America's Sheriff,"" turned himself in Tuesday to a Colorado federal prison to begin serving his 5 1/2-year sentence for a witness tampering conviction. Carona, 55, will serve 66 months in a minimum-security facility called ""The Camp"" at the Englewood federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, said John Sell, a corrections spokesman. The prison is 15 miles southwest of Denver. Carona will have to serve at least 85% of his sentence, spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Central District of California told CNN. Carona was sentenced in April 2009 in federal court in Santa Ana, California. He was convicted of trying to persuade a former assistant to lie to and withhold testimony from a federal grand jury investigating claims of corruption in Carona's campaign and his administration, according to a statement by Mrozek. Carona was also ordered to pay a fine of $125,000, according to Mrozek. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence of a wide-ranging corruption scheme in which Carona used illegal campaign contributions and personally accepted cash bribes, Mrozek's statement said. According to the U.S. attorney's office's press release, U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Guilford sentenced Carona and called witness tampering ""a very serious offense."" The judge added that ""lying will not be tolerated in this courtroom, especially by law enforcement, especially by the highest-ranking law enforcement official in the county,"" according to the prosecutors' statement. During the trial, prosecutors said they presented evidence of a secretly recorded meeting in August 2007 in which Carona tried to persuade former Assistant Sheriff Don Haidl to lie to a grand jury that Carona thought had subpoenaed Haidl, according to Mrozek. In papers filed with the court before the 2009 sentencing, prosecutors charged that Carona received or solicited cash and other items of value worth at least $432,144, according to Mrozek's statement. The FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation into Carona. California news outlets have referred to Carona as ""America's Sheriff"" and have credited former CNN host Larry King with the nickname. In 2002, then-Sheriff Carona appeared on ""Larry King Live"" because he caught the kidnapper and killer of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion, whom Carona dubbed ""America's Little Girl."" King called Carona and the girl's mother, both guests, ""genuine American heroes and heroines,"" according to a CNN transcript.","Former Orange County Sheriff Michael S.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan state TV reported Sunday that the opposition-held town of al-Bregahad been ""been cleansed from the criminal gangs and mercenaries, the area is now safe, and all citizens should go back to their work and their normal life."" Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have been fighting to recapture towns from the rebels since an uprising began last month. Opposition leaders in Benghazi confirmed to CNN that their forces have left al-Brega, but they are calling their move a ""tactical retreat."" The military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf, once in the hands of rebel forces, and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad. The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure. Libya's National Oil Corporation, meanwhile, urged companies to resume oil exports after saying that all ports are safe, state TV reported. Also Sunday, the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group released a video in which it says Abu Yahya al-Libi, an al Qaeda leader, calls on Libyans to take up arms against Gadhafi. The Libyan leader has frequently accused al Qaeda of being behind the unrest that began last month and has since spiraled into a civil war. The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone ""to protect the civilian population"" in Libya, the body's secretary-general Amre Moussa said. ""We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya,"" Moussa said. ""The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced."" The Libyan foreign ministry denounced the League's move, calling it a ""flagrant action against its charter,"" according to state TV Sunday. It also reported that the ministry would welcome the arrival of a fact-finding mission sent by some African nations. Also Saturday, an Al-Jazeera cameraman was killed in an apparent ambush near Benghazi, Libya, becoming the first journalist killed in the country since the start of the civil war, the network reported. Ali Hassan al Jaber was returning to Benghazi, an opposition stronghold in the east, from a nearby town where he had reported on an opposition protest when ""unknown fighters opened fire on a car he and his colleagues were traveling in,"" Al-Jazeera reported on its English-language website. The cameraman and another person were wounded. Al Jaber was rushed to a hospital, but did not survive, the network said. ""Al-Jazeera condemns the cowardly crime, which comes as part of the Libyan regime's malicious campaign targeting Al-Jazeera and its staff,"" the network reported. The no-fly zone which the Arab League is calling for would be a preventive measure and would have to be stopped immediately when the Libyan crisis ends, Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Oman's foreign minister said in a joint appearance with Moussa. Arab League members have reservations about military intervention, but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians, bin Abdullah said. ""We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision,"" he said. ""Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition."" Moussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council, the Libyan opposition's newly formed administration, and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis. ""We are giving them legitimacy but we're not giving them political recognition,"" Moussa said. ""We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality."" The Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya, where war has broken out between forces loyal to Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement. The White House cheered the League's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi, support the opposition and prepare for ""all contingencies."" Opposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion, but Gadhafi's military has recently gained strong momentum. The League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo, while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups. Pleading for international help as they continue to lose ground to pro-Gadhafi forces, rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes. No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly. Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Western powers have said any action by the international community, including a no-fly zone, would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he ""won't take (the) decision lightly"" on whether to use military force, including helping to enforce a no-fly zone, saying it is critical to ""balance costs versus benefits."" While France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people, the European Union was more restrained Friday, saying it ""welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi, which it considers a political interlocutor."" The Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad, where the government ousted rebels about a week ago. CNN's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he didn't see them engage in strikes. He saw some structural damage, such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses, including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house. Some stores were closed and others had been looted.

"(CNN) -- Bernard Hopkins first became a world champion 16 years ago and, aged 46, the American boxer made history in May when he was awarded a points victory over Canadian Jean Pascal to become the sport's oldest-ever holder of a global belt. The World Boxing Council (WBC) light heavyweight champion surpassed the record held by compatriot George Foreman with his win in Montreal, with Hopkins set to become the oldest pugilist to defend a world title if he defeats Chad Dawson on Saturday. If Hopkins emerges victorious at the Staples Center in Los Angeles it would mark the latest achievement in a career which has seen the veteran overcome adversity to reach the top of his sport. ""I love what I do,"" Hopkins told CNN. ""I love to work out, I love to win and I'm going to take advantage of it until I can't do it no more. ""It means a lot that I'm in the history books again ... also it sets up for what comes next. Obviously this Saturday with Chad Dawson ... also becoming the second-oldest fighter to be fighter of the year."" Unsurprisingly, Hopkins is significantly older than his opponent this weekend. Dawson, currently ranked by Ring Magazine as the fourth-best light heavyweight in the world, is 29, 17-years younger than the Pennsylvania-born Hopkins. ""29-years-old, as we've seen with Jean Pascal, as we've seen with Kelly Pavlik, as we've seen with most of the guys I've fought that are younger than me at least by 15 years. ""If it's just age, if it's just height. If it's just things that have nothing to do with the IQ ... That's not enough to beat Bernard Hopkins. ""And I mean that. I mean that with confidence and I don't mean that with just promoting. I mean that ... because of how I've been disciplined over these years to train and live and think that way."" But despite his age, Hopkins will not be the oldest fighter on the card in California on Saturday. That honor will belong to Dewey Bozella. The 52-year-old cruiserweight who will be making his debut as a professional boxer in a four-round cruiserweight bout against Larry Hopkins, no relation to Bernard Hopkins, but that is only half of his incredible story. Bozella spent 26 years in New York's Sing Sing prison after being found guilty of murder in 1983, before having his conviction overturned two years ago. During his incarceration, Bozella focused on boxing an was even crowned the Sing Sing heavyweight champion. His story is one which resonates with Hopkins, who served a five-year stretch in Graterford Prison, Pennsylvania between 1983 and 1988. So impressed was Hopkins with Bozella that he has been training with the newcomer ahead of his much-anticipated fight. ""It inspired me,"" said Hopkins of Bozell. ""He chose to do what he did, and not only did he get freedom, but he got humanity. An opportunity to do something that was taken from him years and years ago. To be on a major, major fight card. ""And now that we became, I can say friends, and have understanding about that dark place that I put myself in, you know, I wasn't innocent. But we still understand that dark place. Everybody has a story, but his is beyond a story.""","Bernard Hopkins is the oldest world champion in boxing's history .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- A cease-fire didn't last very long Thursday as more than a dozen rockets from Gaza were fired at southern Israel and the Israeli air force hit what it labeled as seven terror sites, according to Israel Defense Forces. Of the 18 rockets fired, eight struck Israel and eight landed in Palestinian areas, IDF tweeted. Two were shot down, Israel said. Palestinian security officials told CNN that Israeli warplanes bombed a training base of al-Qassam Brigades -- the military wing of Hamas -- while another targeted an old intelligence building. There were no casualties, the officials reported. IDF said it attacked four sites in the southern Gaza and three in northern Gaza. ""Militants attacking Israel from the Gaza Strip will not feel safe, will pay the price and will find that their actions are futile,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for IDF, tweeted. There was news earlier of an Egyptian-brokered truce. Islamic Jihad Khaled Al-Batash told CNN the truce started at 3 p.m. local (9 a.m. ET). Two hours later, two rockets were fired from Gaza, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Palestinian leader blames Israel . Israelis have been preparing for continuing violence, with IDF calling up reservists to man Iron Dome batteries that are intended to intercept missiles from Gaza, according to a spokesman. They intercepted three such missiles Wednesday night and the two Thursday. Another spokesman said the reserves were being brought in for ""operational assessment and accordance with the air force necessities."" Islamic Jihad said the flare-up came after three of its operatives were killed Tuesday by an Israeli military strike in Gaza. The operatives had traveled to Gaza to inspect an Israeli drone -- a small surveillance aircraft -- that had become disabled, Islamic Jihad said. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas blamed the Israelis for the outbreak. ""The Israeli occupation forces killed in cold blood three Palestinians in the West Bank and another three in Gaza, and we did not hear any condemnation or any apologies to these acts from the Israeli government,"" he said Thursday in a joint news conference in Bethlehem with British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""And, yesterday, the launching of rockets happened from Gaza and Israel retaliated to that, and we condemn this escalated military aggression in all its forms, including the firing of rockets,"" he told reporters, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon blamed the attacks on Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, two years after Israel disengaged unilaterally from the area. ""The Hamas is responsible for Gaza and if the Hamas does not know how to ensure the quiet, they will also be responsible,"" he said in Hebrew. ""We are prepared for all possibilities."" Only a few days ago, Egypt declared Hamas a terrorist organization and outlawed its activities in the country. This followed the military-backed government's fierce crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which is linked to Hamas. Airstrikes, rocket fire . Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told Israeli army radio that ""the position of my party Israel Beitanyu is that we support the full occupation of the whole of Gaza in any possible future action."" Liberman opposed a response short of full occupation. ""I am against a limited operation,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked Wednesday evening for his reaction to Liberman's comments at a joint news conference with Cameron in Jerusalem. ""If it is not quiet in southern Israel, it will be very noisy in Gaza,"" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. The announcement of the cease-fire came shortly after four Palestinian residents were critically wounded in an airstrike on tunnels near the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Palestinian medical sources told CNN. A Hamas website reported five people were injured in two attacks. Security sources said one of the attacks struck west of Rafah, destroying two tunnels; a second attack struck east of Rafah on open land. Israel Defense Forces said that two rockets hit southern Israel Thursday and that the country's air force retaliated ""by targeting seven terror sites"" in southern Gaza. Since Wednesday, about 65 rockets have struck Israeli territory, five of them hitting populated areas, IDF said. Lerner said Thursday in a statement that there had been ""a substantial deterioration"" in the safety of southern Israel's residents. ""We have responded and will continue to do so in order to eliminate threats as they develop. This is our obligation and responsibility to those exposed to Gaza terrorism.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly four years into his speakership, John Boehner is stronger than ever. Boehner will be elected to his third term as Speaker on Thursday, a few days before his 66th birthday. He's already facing post-election grumbling from conservatives, but his position is remarkably secure for a Speaker whose tenure has been marked by the drama of the debt ceiling standoff, the government shutdown and the battles within the GOP. The Ohio Republican will soon preside over the largest House GOP majority since World War II and have a new partner in the Senate when Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, becomes majority leader. Boehner will still confront plenty of challenges as he shifts from being the face of the opposition party in Congress to a leader aiming to prove Republicans can govern ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Conservatives say they are worried that Boehner and McConnell may put too much emphasis on proving they can make a dysfunctional Congress work without focusing enough on laying out an agenda that sets up a clear contrast with Democrats. Kansas GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a frequent Boehner critic from the right, told CNN that the midterm elections were a mandate for change and ""change wasn't compromise with the president."" He said ""what won the election in 2014 was bold conservative principles and solutions."" Social conservatives . Huelskamp said he agrees with Boehner's pledge to again pass a series of GOP economic measures next year that the Democratic-led Senate ignored. But he insisted that the GOP base also wants to see a Republican Congress take measures backed by social conservatives, and he cited ""traditional marriage and pro-life bills."" Boehner and McConnell, meanwhile, have largely stayed away from talking about social issues. ""If they define success as passing bills that the president signs, that is setting themselves up for failure over the next year,"" said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, a conservative group that has clashed with Boehner in the past. Holler said the list of economic items that the two Republican leaders listed in their op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal last week was on target, but viewed by conservatives as just ""a good start."" The expanded GOP majority will give the Speaker a bit of a cushion so he can push back against the band of House conservatives who thwarted his legislative strategy and pushed the House to shut down the government last fall. Over the last four years, the Speaker has reminded his own members who wanted bolder action that he faced limits on what he could do because he only controlled ""one half of one third of the government."" ""Most of us were tired of hearing 'this is all Harry Reid will agree to' - that's so 2014,"" Huelskamp said, referring to the current Senate majority leader. Opposing Boehner . Other Boehner critics already plan to vote against him serving another term. A small group of GOP candidates who were elected last Tuesday night campaigned on the pledge they would oppose Boehner remaining Speaker. But the movement isn't big enough or sufficiently organized to cause any serious trouble. There is an effort, backed by Boehner allies, to get those who oppose him to do so behind closed doors on Thursday. This would avoid the embarrassment he endured in 2013 when live C-Span cameras showed a dozen House Republicans voting for someone else or skipping the vote on the House floor when Boehner began his second term. Huelskamp is one of those who publicly opposed Boehner two years ago. Boehner stripped him of his seat on the Budget committee after a series of splits with GOP leaders in 2012. Huelskamp told CNN ""the Speaker and I have our disagreements"" but that he planned to vote for him this time. He said he spoke with the Speaker recently, but declined to describe the ""private discussion."" The problem for those in the anti-Boehner crowd is they don't have an alternative candidate. Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, who is popular among many conservatives and considered a leadership bid, decided he wanted to remain in his current post as the chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee. It is true that some of the new House Republicans are just as conservative -- if not more so -- than the members they replaced. But several House Republicans and leadership aides all say that numerically ""it's a wash"" in terms of how big of a group of rabble rousers Boehner can expect to deal with in the next Congress. Many of those in the right wing of the GOP conference who split with Boehner were fueled by support and encouragement from outside groups. But these groups lost a lot of their clout and credibility after the spending confrontation they demanded led to the shutdown, which Boehner warned would damage the GOP's message . After the surprise defeat of Boehner's former number two - Eric Cantor - who many viewed as his only possible successor, Boehner has worked to solidify his power. Boehner spent most of the summer and fall months traversing the country campaigning for Republican candidates and collecting political chits. He visited 175 cities and remained the top House GOP fundraiser - - bringing in a whopping $102 million for GOP candidates from his various political committees. 'Strong position to persuade' Boehner is ""in a strong position to persuade,"" Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole told CNN. As a 24 year veteran of the House who once served as the Chair of the House Education Committee, Boehner is an institutionalist. He and McConnell are both masters of the behind the scenes legislative maneuvering that is little noticed by the public, but can lead to important deals. It's still unclear how willing Boehner will be to give any major concessions and work with the president and Democrats to pass items like new infrastructure programs and new trade authority. There's a sense that corralling what can sometimes be a rambunctious House GOP conference is a job that no one else besides Boehner is prepared to take on at this point -- or even wants. When Republicans gather this week, Boehner is likely to walk a fine line between telling his members what they want to hear about pushing conservative legislation next year, while starting to set some expectations. Those who have split with the Speaker say their disagreements have never been personal, and he's earned genuine respect. Many enjoy it when he leads the infamous ""Boehner birthday song,"" a fun, very short ditty members use to mark birthdays and now share on Twitter. ""Who else has a birthday song that everyone sings? He's clearly endeared and ingrained himself in a way that's quite unprecedented,"" Cole told CNN.","House GOP will elect Boehner speaker on Thursday .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A 22-year-old medical student suspected of killing a woman he may have met through a Craigslist online ad was arraigned Tuesday and will be held without bail. Medical student Philip Markoff, 22, appears in court Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts. Philip Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, listened intently but did not speak during the hearing in Boston Municipal Court. Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is ""not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything."" A woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. Megan McAllister said Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,"" McAllister wrote. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" She accused Boston police of ""trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations. What else is new??"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters, ""This was a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them."" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said. A Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday. Markoff is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman ""put up a fight,"" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service. She sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said. Markoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified. Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads » . Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man. Police traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and ""the case just begins to build from there."" ""This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,"" Conley said. There may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. ""If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,"" he said. Markoff is ""bearing up,"" according to attorney Salsberg. ""It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,"" said Salsberg. McAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, ""Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it. We expect to marry in August and share a wonderful, meaningful life together."" The couple's wedding Web site had been taken down or was unavailable as of Tuesday afternoon. Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said no conclusions could be made yet, but allowed that the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area."" Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster told CNN the company is ""horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence."" He promised that Craigslist will evaluate the incident to see if additional measures could be introduced to protect users. CNN's Mary Snow and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","Not-guilty plea entered in Philip Markoff's behalf in woman's slaying in Boston .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- All that glitters may not be gold, but for Colombia's narco-molls the most important thing is that it glitters. Yovanna Guzman was 19 when she met drug  boss Wilber Varela, and she says he showered her with luxuries. Beauty queens, fashion models, actresses or regular girls made good are lovers of drug capos and above all lovers of the finest luxuries that cocaine money can buy. Few are prepared to speak publicly and even less to appear on camera. Those who date mob bosses don't want to blow their cover. It could expose their boyfriends to arrest and themselves to retaliation. In addition, it could bring anti-drug police sniffing, ready to seize ill-gotten gains. One exception is Yovanna Guzman, a former beauty queen and model, with a mane of blond hair and a pneumatic figure -- a sure passport into the narco underworld where cup size is more important than IQ. For eight years, she was the lover of one of Colombia's most ruthless cocaine traffickers, Wilber Varela. He was head of the North Valle Cartel. ""He had two faces. I saw him so tender with the ones he loved, then you see the cartel killings. He always said he was the best of friends and the worst of enemies,"" Guzman said during an interview in Bogota.  Watch Guzman describe Varela and how she met him » . The Colombian government accused Varela of running tons of cocaine to the United States via Central America in go-fast speedboats and to Europe in small jets. Should drugs be legalized? Sound off below . Authorities put a $5 million bounty on his head. He gained a reputation for brutality during a yearslong dispute with a splinter faction of the same cartel, led by Diego Montoya, who until his capture in 2007 was listed alongside Osama bin Laden on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. Guzman was 19 when she met Varela. He told her he was a cattle rancher. She didn't ask questions and said she only found out the truth when she saw a Wanted poster with her boyfriend's mug shot. He wooed her with expensive gifts and sponsored her through Chica Med, a second-rate beauty pageant organizers concede was viewed as a cattle market by gangsters looking for new girls. Some mob bosses bought the beauty title as a gift for their molls, though it's not clear whether Varela paid for Guzman's title. ""There were the vacations, the cars and the luxury SUVs and, of course, jewelry. There was always jewelry. But there were small details too like flowers,"" she said. ""Of course, the luxuries don't make you fall in love, but they do dazzle you. When you get dazzled, you get carried away, but then you ask yourself where is the love and my principles?"" Guzman said Varela's first gift to her was a Rolex watch, followed by a Cartier watch, diamonds, jewelry, top-of-the-range sport utility vehicles and luxury apartments. She said she now realizes she was being bought and admits she sold herself. ""I feel all of us have a price up to a point. Sometimes you feel luxuries like the designer clothes, shoes and handbags are important. But afterward you realize you're empty inside,"" she said. Very quickly her drug lord boyfriend locked Guzman in a golden cage. He forbade her to do photo shoots or party with male friends, even though he had a stable of other top model girlfriends. ""He was very jealous, and what's his is his and belongs to nobody else and nobody can touch it, look at it or mess with it,"" she said. As Colombia's law enforcers stepped up the hunt for Varela, Guzman's time with him became less frequent. But she said he always seemed to know where she was or to whom she had talked. At one point, she said, a jealous Varela sent one of his lieutenants to shoot her in the leg. ""When I got shot, I was supposedly never going to walk properly again. The bullet could easily have hit me somewhere else and killed me. But I pulled myself together and I said I'm not going to be crippled,"" she said. What Guzman wouldn't explain was the reason for the punishment shooting. She giggled and promised to reveal the full details in a book she's writing. She said she hopes her experiences will serve as a cautionary tale for other young women on the trail of easy money. Whether or not they will take a leaf out of that book is another matter. Ordinary Colombians seem to have an unshakable attraction to glamorous narco-lifestyles judging by the sky-high ratings of two TV soap operas. The ""Cartel"" tells the story of the rise of the North Valle mob that Varela headed. The sequel, called ""Mafia Dolls,"" portrays women such as Guzman. One of the silicone-enhanced actresses who played a supporting role in both soaps said that since her TV appearances she has received offers from real-life drug dealers, both in Medellin and Cali. ""Those narcos watch TV and are always on the lookout for fresh meat. So I began getting the calls when I appeared in 'The Cartel,' "" she said. ""I got a phone call from a guy who is a showbiz publicist, and he told me a guy from Medellin was offering $7,500 for me to spend the evening with him."" She said she refused that overture. Days later, a new BMW X5 SUV, with a bow on top, was left outside her home by the same drug trafficker who was trying to woo her. She said she returned the gift but gave no explanation how she found out the return address, given how secretive Colombian mob bosses are. ""All those narcos care about is how big your breasts are. If they want you, the first thing they do is send you to their plastic surgeons to have silicone implants. But it's them who decide how big you should be, not you,"" she went on. Guzman dares tell her story now for a simple reason -- Varela is dead. He was slain last year by one of his power-hungry lieutenants eager to take over the business. It marked the end of a nightmare she walked into with her eyes wide open. ""[When I heard the news], I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. Varela had his good side, but my freedom doesn't have a price,"" she said. ""I felt the golden cage had been flung open, and I could fly again.""","Former girlfriend of Colombian drug lord admits being bought by luxuries .

"(CNN) -- Despite most of the team being of short stature and playing barefoot, the Triqui Indian boys from Mexico won the championship -- and the hearts of many -- at the International Festival of Mini-Basketball held in Argentina. Their coach, Sergio Zuniga explains that playing barefoot is a reflection of the poverty in their community in the state of Oaxaca. ""The boys train barefoot, they always walk barefoot. There are no resources to buy shoes,"" Zuniga commented in an interview with the Basketball Federation of the Province of Cordoba, where the tournament was held. The seven games against six local teams ended with incredible scores: 86-3 over Celestes; 22-6 against Cordoba University; 72-16 against Central; 82-18 over Hindu; 44-12 against Monteeis and 40-16 over Regatas de Mendoza. The National Sports and Physical Culture Commission of Mexico named the team as the ""Barefoot Giants of the Mountains."" Blog: New era for women's basketball in the U.S.? 54 teams from various Argentine provinces and countries such as Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela, participated in the tournament. A total of 8,000 kids were part of the championship held from October 11th to 14th. Last year, the youth championship (which started in 2010 in Ecuador) was held in La Vega, Dominican Republic. About 400 kids participated in the event. Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and delegations from 20 Dominican provinces were part of the championship. Education first . The Triqui children-training program began its operations in 2009 with 500 kids. Nowadays, it trains around 2,500 children with focuses on: psychology, leadership and ""laughter therapy,"" according to coach Zuniga. ""The main idea was to help these children through sports, to give them a different opportunity: go to school, play basketball, to get away from the mountains, to see other parts of the world,"" he said. The most important factor that determines who participates in the tournament (or who gets to be in the team) is to have good grades. ""If they don't have a 8.5 grade --out of 10-- (in elementary school,) they don't train or play."" ""With education as the motivator, the kids are going back to school, which is the project's main goal: give these kids an education through basketball. Away from the sports, the most important results are those reached at school."" According to Zuniga, the academy's success inspired other Mexican states to adopt the Triqui community model. Similarly other countries such as Peru, Bolivia and some Hispanic communities in the United States have expressed interest in the program. Winning attitude . The Triqui kids were inspired after the Mexican team reigned at the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship held in Caracas, Venezuela in September. ""We can also do it. If they did it, we can also win, we can qualify and be world champions,"" said Rigoberto Lopez, 11, a member of the Triqui kids team, to CNN en Espanol before traveling to Argentina. Silverio Cruz, 9, another member of the Triqui basketball team, said the most important element in the game is to have the ""mentality of a champion."" Before leaving Argentina, the kids also defeated the Gorriones de Argentina 3-1 in a soccer match. The team's next goal is to participate in the 2014 Barcelona Cup Basketball Tournament. In the meantime, they will keep working hard and will continue their journey to achieve their goals. ""It's beautiful to see that all their cons became their weapons. Hunger, poverty, motivated them to show themselves as they are. It's something we lack in Mexico: character, strength, inner strength. They are setting an example, even to me, that yes, you can do it,"" said Zuniga.","Triqui Indian boys from Mexico win basketball tournament playing barefoot .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- She walked to the cameras and could barely look up. With her lip quivering, Sherry Jarvis apologized to the family of 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who is clinging to life in a hospital burn unit. Jarvis is the mother of two boys who, along with three other youths, are accused in the burning of Brewer. Detectives say witnesses saw Brewer, consumed in flames, run about a hundred yards, tear off his shirt and jump into a swimming pool. Brewer's screams can be heard on a 911 call from the October 12 incident. Doctors say he was burned on about 65 percent of his body. ""I'd just like to express how horribly sorry we are,"" Jarvis said in a public statement she and her family made Wednesday. Accompanied by her husband and two daughters, Jarvis spoke slowly as she addressed a gathering of reporters. ""This is a horrible incident that should have never had occurred."" said Jarvis, her voice full of sorrow and shock. Her sons, ages 13 and 15, face charges that could send them to prison for a long time. Authorities in Broward County, Florida, believe that Brewer was attacked in a chain of events that began when he did not pay one of the five boys $40 for a video game. That boy stole Brewer's father's bicycle, and when Brewer told police, the youth was arrested, then released, authorities said. The next day, the group of five teens allegedly surrounded Brewer and, according to eyewitnesses, yelled, ""He's a snitch. He's a snitch"" before one of them poured alcohol over him, another sparked a lighter, and Brewer was ablaze. All of the boys had been friends since elementary school, authorities said. They did sleepovers at one another's homes, and their families knew each other. ""We pray for Michael's recovery every day, that he gets stronger, which we know in our hearts that he will,"" Sherry Jarvis said. But doctors are unsure about his recovery. Brewer remains on a ventilator. A machine is breathing for him. Each day, a team of doctors spends about four hours changing his bandages. He remains heavily sedated and is going through a very difficult period right now, according to doctors. ""The swelling has come way down, and you can recognize facial expressions now,"" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami. ""We're still dealing with the respiratory failure. We're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive,"" Namias told CNN. ""People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about. He is by no means well ... but the expectation is survival,"" he said. Because he is sedated and on the ventilator, Brewer has been unable to communicate with detectives. Earlier this week, prosecutors were granted extra time to build their cases against the five teens, four 15-year-olds and the 13-year-old. Prosecutors have until November 12 to charge the five as adults, or they will be charged as juveniles and released pending trial later. The 13-year-old cannot face adult charges under Florida law, but that would change if Brewer died. Prosecutors want to interview Brewer about the incident, but doctors say that is unlikely to happen before next week. Brewer's family was not represented at the Jarvis family's public apology. The victim's parents could not be reached for comment. After making her apology, Jarvis said the family would not take questions from the gathered reporters. ""I don't have the words to express any more. I can't answer any more questions because of the criminal case that's still pending,"" she said. The Jarvis family has received death threats, according to family members and their attorney. They haven't stayed at their home since the incident, they say, adding that people have been throwing garbage and even dead animals on their property. On Wednesday, with their attorney at their side, they simply wanted to say to Michael Brewer and his family that they are sorry. Detectives have returned to the Brewer house, after two dolls were found in the swimming pool. The male and female dolls had been melted together, head to feet. ""At this point, we're thinking it's a sick joke, said Jim Leljedal, a spokesman for the Broward County Sheriff's Office. ""It's being classified as criminal mischief, but we'd like to know who's responsible,"" he said.","Five teenagers are accused in the burning of a Florida boy .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Jordan warned Wednesday that ""credible information"" has been received about a possible imminent threat in the region of the Gulf of Aqaba, the branch of the Red Sea that lies between Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The embassy warned U.S. citizens to avoid the downtown and port areas of the city of Aqaba, a tourist destination that lies on the Red Sea near the border with Israel. It recommended that all non-official and personal travel to Aqaba be deferred for at least 48 hours. The embassy issued a similar warning last month, after two rockets hit a street near the Intercontinental Hotel in Aqaba on August 2. News reports said a Jordanian civilian was killed. Rockets were also fired the same day at the Israeli Red Sea resort city of Eilat, according to news reports. However, Ali Al Ayed, Jordan's minister for media affairs and communications, told the state news agency Petra that the security situation was assessed and is considered stable.

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's choice for running mate will be announced to supporters in a text message Saturday morning, senior Obama campaign officials told CNN on Friday night, and a senior party official said it won't be Sen. Hillary Clinton. Sen. Barack Obama says he has decided on his running mate but is not yet ready to reveal the name. Obama called some people on his short list for the vice presidential slot Thursday night to tell them he had not selected them as a running mate, a highly placed Democratic Party source said. A senior Democratic official who had spoken with Clinton told CNN late Friday that the Obama campaign has communicated to her through private channels that she will not be Obama's vice presidential pick. Also, sources close to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said he has been informed he was not selected. One source told CNN that Obama personally made the call to Kaine. Another source said Kaine has flown to Denver, Colorado, for the Democratic National Convention. See who's in the running . It is not known who else may have gotten calls. However, late Friday two Democratic sources confirmed that Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh is also out of the running. Most of this week's buzz had been around Bayh of Indiana, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and Kaine. The contenders kept a low profile and Biden has avoided any lengthy interviews. Rep. Chet Edwards said Friday that the campaign had vetted him but that he hasn't talked to Obama.  Watch panelists weigh in on top VP contenders » . Edwards, 56, is a nine-term congressman representing the Central Texas district that includes President Bush's ranch near Crawford. This month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touted Edwards as a dark horse contender for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. The presumptive Democratic nominee was working Friday in Chicago, Illinois, on his address for the convention. He will launch a string of rallies with his running mate on Saturday in Springfield, Illinois. Obama said Thursday that he had made his decision but declined to give further details. ""I won't comment on anything else until I introduce our running mate to the world,"" Obama said in Emporia, Virginia. ""That's all you're going to get out of me."" Watch Obama say he's made his choice » . Clinton re-entered the running mate conversation this week after a poll indicating that nearly half of her supporters have yet to embrace Obama. The Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll out Wednesday night said 52 percent of Clinton supporters said they will vote for Obama. Twenty-one percent favor Republican Sen. John McCain, while 27 percent are undecided or say they will vote for ""someone else.'' The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The former first lady was considered one of the top VP contenders shortly after she ended her White House run in June, but rumors of lingering tension between the former rivals and word that her name would be placed in nomination at the convention are partially to blame for political observers kicking her out of the top tier. Other big names thought to be in the running included retired Gen. Wesley Clark, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.

"London (CNN) -- Space has come of age, grown up enough to be commercially viable -- or has it? For more than 80 years the BIS has been looking at how we get into, and travel in, space, but the society has concentrated more on the technical achievement or feasibility than on the finance or contractual requirements. From the end of World War II, technologies were very much in the hands of the defense industries and development was funded by the defense departments of national governments. Recognizing the strategic importance of space led to the 'space race' and the conquest of space being nationally or government funded. However, times change. The end of the Cold War led to the end of the space race -- governments no longer had to prove their nation's technical superiority in space. But in many Western industrialized nations, as the government support and funding reduced overall, there appeared a raft of technically capable companies and some government departments and entrepreneurs who were able to identify key areas where there could be a viable and sustainable return on their investment. Communications satellites became commercial products as soon it was realized that communications capacity could be sold and could provide a realistic return over their lifetime. Science and Earth observation (EO) missions have not met with such commercialization yet. It is difficult to see a commercial return from scientific exploration of either our own planet or other celestial bodies. But the gathered EO information could see a commercial return from the sale of mapping, environmental or weather data, or charges for navigation services. However, military and government owned assets -- already fully operational -- make it hard to compete. When it comes to launchers and human spaceflight things are changing. The original missile-based launch vehicles gave way to commercially manufactured, but government-owned and operated systems. Now the launcher market is opening up as new players broach new user markets. Space tourism and small payloads have very different launch requirements that are best satisfied by new systems -- like Virgin Galactic's Spaceship 2 and XCOR's Lynx spaceplanes. BIS spokesman Nick Spall adds: ""For many the fascination for space is the almost visceral desire we have to travel further and faster to explore and to spread human interest across the cosmos. The BIS has championed the goal of eventually colonizing the solar system and, indeed, traveling on to the stars one day. ""To achieve this human spaceflight ambition, NASA is quite correct in its decision to use a commercialized approach to lowering the cost of launching astronauts into orbit. The investment in Boeing's CST-100 and the Space X V2 spacecraft for flights to the ISS from 2017 will make seat prices cheaper and more sustainable. ""For the future though, reusable spaceplanes such as the UK's Skylon are the real answer to getting humans and hardware into space to properly explore and occupy the rest of the solar system. ""To help this low-cost approach happen, purely private space tourism spacecraft companies will offer affordable flights to space, with Virgin Galactic's SS2 and the XCOR Lynx going sub-orbit in the next two years. One day we will see space hotels in orbit and then on the Moon and eventually Mars. ""To go into deep space, to asteroids, the Moon and Mars, governments will have to foot the bill initially, but the possibilities are immense and there is a very exciting future for humans in space,"" he said. BIS President-Elect Mark Hempsell believes the UK government's new policy of maximizing economic return from space is illustrated by the recent studies into setting up spaceports in the UK, both for suborbital and orbital flights. ""The recent change in UK government direction, with the formation of the UK Space Agency as a key component, is at long last connecting the vision within Britain with the capability to realize its potential,"" he said. Another important factor of space exploration is in its relations with the dual areas of education and outreach. Space education . BIS vice president Chris Welch said: ""Space -- and especially space exploration -- has been shown time and again to engage and motivate students in a way that few other topics can. ""It also has a role to play for defining how a country sees itself. One only has to look at the recent exploits of China and India to see how success in space exploration can transform a nation's view of itself and what its citizens can achieve if they believe they can aspire to greatness,"" he said. NASA's decision to sub-contract Boeing and SpaceX is a sign of things to come, but governments must continue to support and fund those areas that are not yet self-sustaining. The UK space sector is currently bringing in over Â£11.3 billion ($18.07 billion) per annum to the UK economy and supports 99,000 jobs. The UK government, recognizing this important contribution, plans to capture 10% of the world space market and generate more than Â£40 billion ($64 billion) per annum by 2030, according to the UK government. This will certainly require the support and leadership of UK industry and the creation of up to 100,000 new jobs. With India's Mangalyaan spacecraft now orbiting Mars and China's ""taikonauts"" in Earth orbit and its Chang'e 3 lunar lander already on the Moon, the competition is heating up. The space industries of the Western industrialized nations must play their part in identifying where they can make a real contribution and even take a leadership role, while the national space agencies take on more of a coordination and funding role, particularly in scientific exploration and manned missions .","It is difficult to see a commercial return from scientific exploration, says Alistair Scott .

"(CNN) -- Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro made a disappointing comeback from injury at the Thailand Open in Bangkok on Tuesday, where he was defeated 7-6 6-4 by Olivier Rochus of Belgium in the opening round. The 22-year-old has not played on the ATP Tour since losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open in January, after sustaining a wrist injury which has seen the former world number four slip to 36 in the world rankings. But despite serving 16 aces during the match, the 2009 U.S. Open champion's return to the game was cut short by world number 78 Rochus in just under two hours. A foot shorter than his two-meter, Rochus came through a close first set and a break down in the second to book his place in the second round of south-east Asian tournament where he will play Kazakhstani Mikhail Kukushkin. After the match fifth seed Del Potro was full of praise for his victor and said he was just happy to be playing again despite the loss. ""I played a good match,"" Del Potro told the official ATP website. ""I had my chances in the first-set tie-break and he played some great points. He served very good, which was important on this kind of surface. He played very well today. ""I'm just happy to be back on the circuit and I hope I get better and better.""

"(CNN) -- Saudi King Abdullah has pardoned a rape victim who had been sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison in a case that sparked international attention, a Saudi newspaper has reported. The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. Al-Jazirah newspaper quoted a Saudi Justice Ministry official saying King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in Saudi Arabia. The victim's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon, but considers it to be legitimate since it was announced in an official Saudi newspaper. He thanked King Abdullah for the pardon, saying: ""This fatherly care and noble gesture will help (in) lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring."" ""This is not something new because we know that the King was always generous in dealing with his people and the entire world,"" the husband said. ""This week, we have two holidays to celebrate; the Eid and this great news of the pardon."" Saudi sources told CNN that the king's pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid al-Adha festival that follows, which is normally when the Saudi monarch issues amnesty for prisoners. Watch how Arab media is reporting the story. » . Saudi Arabia's Justice Minister Abdullah Bin Mohammad al-Sheikh told al-Jazirah newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Saudi people, and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system. The White House welcomed King Abdullah's decision, but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that ""this is obviously a matter for the Saudi Arabians and King Abdullah."" A Saudi court ruled the 19-year-old had an ""illegitimate relationship"" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a ""compromising situation, her clothes on the ground."" The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married. The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under strict Islamic law in Saudi Arabia. The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March. Seven men, convicted of abducting the pair and raping her, were sentenced from two to nine years in prison. Abdul Rahman al-Lahim, the lawyer who represented the woman, faced a disciplinary hearing for ""insulting the Supreme Judicial Council and disobeying the rules and regulations"" of the judiciary.  The hearing has been postponed. The woman's husband has been outspoken in his support for his wife. He called a Lebanese TV show to defend her, when a former Saudi judge claimed on the program that she ""spoil(ed) their marital bed"" by meeting an unrelated male ""in secret"" and admitted her guilt. Al-Lahim has said he hopes the case changes the Saudi justice system. ""We want to highlight the rape crimes in Saudi Arabia and the way they are handled and sentenced in court,"" he added.

"U.N. inspectors prepared to examine the site of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria on Monday, a strike a U.S. official said was all but certain was carried out by the embattled Syrian government. Rebel forces and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government have been blaming each other for Wednesday's reported attack in a suburb of Damascus, which opposition members say killed hundreds. Gruesome video of the aftermath showed numerous bodies, including women and children. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the evidence pointing to government forces goes beyond images and open-source reporting from doctors and others. ""There is nothing credible to indicate that the rebels, either the Syrian National Council or even al-Nusra Front, have used chemical weapons,"" the official said. ""Only the Assad regime is responsible for chemical weapons use."" The Syrian government has steadfastly denied its forces used chemical weapons outside Damascus or elsewhere and repeated the denial Sunday. But a second U.S. official said Sunday that tissue samples were collected from the scene in the hours and days after the August 21 attack. The official says the evidence was ""collected by multiple international sources"" and was being analyzed in secure locations. The official would not say how the samples were collected or specify where the analysis was taking place. But with the United States and its allies warning of military action, Syria's leading ally invoked the history of Western claims about Iraq urged Washington to avoid ""a reckless enterprise."" Russia's Foreign Ministry said unilateral force that bypassed the United Nations would ""undermine international efforts to find a political and diplomatic solution to the Syrian conflict, lead to its further escalation and have an extremely destructive effect on what already is an explosive situation in the Middle East."" ""All this is reminiscent of events of 10 years ago in which, using false information that the Iraqis possessed weapons of mass destruction as a pretext and bypassing the United Nations, the United States launched a reckless enterprise with consequences that everyone is well aware of,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman A.K. Lukashevich said in a written statement. The statement added: ""Our American and European partners should realize what catastrophic consequences such a policy would have for the region, for the Arab world, and for the entire Islamic world."" Syria agrees to stop shooting during U.N. inspection . These developments came as a top Syrian official told CNN on Sunday that the government would allow U.N. inspectors full access to any site of a suspected chemical weapons attack. The agreement is effective immediately, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad said. The U.N. secretary-general's office said inspectors hope to begin their investigation Monday at the suspected chemical attack site. The Syrian government has agreed to cease all hostilities as long as the U.N. inspectors are on the ground. Before Sunday, U.N. inspectors in Syria attempting to gather information were not allowed to visit the site of the recent attack. But one senior Obama administration official said the Syrian government's announcement was too little, too late. ""If the Syrian government had nothing to hide and wanted to prove to the world that it had not used chemical weapons in this incident, it would have ceased its attacks on the area and granted immediate access to the U.N. -- five days ago,"" the official said. ""At this juncture, the belated decision by the regime to grant access to the U.N. team is too late to be credible, including because the evidence available has been significantly corrupted as a result of the regime's persistent shelling and other intentional actions over the last five days,"" the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said in a statement. ""Based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, witness accounts, and other facts gathered by open sources, the U.S. intelligence community, and international partners, there is very little doubt at this point that a chemical weapon was used by the Syrian regime against civilians in this incident."" The same senior Obama administration official said the United States is ""continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons."" Last year, while discussing the situation in Syria, President Barack Obama said ""a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized."" The Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region, and two key members of U.S. congressional foreign affairs panels said Sunday they expect the United States to strike Syria after reports of chemical weapons attacks in that country. On Friday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the American military was providing Obama ""with options for all contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces [and] positioning our assets to be able to carry out whatever options the president might choose."" Jihadist group vows revenge . Meanwhile, the jihadist group al-Nusra Front, which has ties to al Qaeda, vowed Sunday to avenge the suspected chemical attack by targeting villages populated by Syria's Alawite minority, the sect to which al-Assad belongs. Competing claims on chemical weapons use in Syria . An audio message posted on YouTube, purportedly from al-Nusra leader Abu Muhammad al-Joulani, accuses the Syrian regime  of bombarding eastern Ghouta ""with tens of missiles"" carrying a ""suffocating chemical agent,"" killing ""hundreds of children, women and men."" ""We are announcing a series of revenge operations called 'An Eye for an Eye.' Your Alawite villages will pay a very dear price for every chemical rocket that you've launched against our people."" According to Syrian state-run television's depiction of events, government forces came across the site of the gas attack when they entered the rebel stronghold of Jobar on the edge of Damascus. The bodies of some of those killed in the attack early Wednesday had been found there. Several of the soldiers were ""suffocating"" from exposure to gases as they entered the city, according to state TV. ""It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area,"" Syrian TV reported, citing an anonymous source. The government uses the term ""terrorists"" to describe rebel forces. Broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks, gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack. The army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in Jobar. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video. ""We said it from the first moment and, here, we assure again that we have never used chemical weapons (around Jobar) or any other region in any form whatsoever -- ... liquid, gas or whatever,"" Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said in an interview on Lebanese television. He blamed the rebels. Syria's refugee children will be the ones to rebuild . Opposition accusations . The rebels say that government forces fired rockets into the heavily populated civilian area. Opposition spokesman Badr Jamous from the Syrian National Coalition claimed that some of the rockets delivered chemical payloads. More than 1,300 people were killed, most of them by gas, said Khaled al-Saleh, another spokesman for the group. Al-Saleh said that medical teams in the affected area had administered 25,000 shots of atropine -- a medication used to treat people exposed to the nerve gas sarin -- after the attack. Doctors Without Borders said three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate reported having received some 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms last Wednesday morning. ""The reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events -- characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent,"" said Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations. Video showed rows of bodies without apparent injury, as well as people suffering convulsions or who appeared to be struggling to breathe. CNN could not verify where or when the videos were recorded, and could not confirm the number of casualties.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- What is most shocking about Gabby Giffords now is how much she looks like her old self. Her golden locks are back; so is the sparkle in her eyes and her broad smile. Gone is the short hair and thin frame we saw at the beginning of her recovery. Yet she knows she will never be the same. ""Stronger. Stronger, better, tougher. Stronger, better, tougher."" That's how Giffords describes herself. The former Arizona congresswoman makes that declaration with determination and gusto. But it still takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration to articulate that, or anything else. Being with Giffords, who was shot in the head two years ago during an appearance in front of an Arizona supermarket, it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her. She follows conversation, reacts, engages and offers unsolicited ideas -- usually in the form of a single word or gesture that makes clear what she means. Exclusive: Gabby Giffords still appreciates gun culture . But at times, even simple words are a struggle, like when she tries to explain how she spends her days. ""Occupational therapy, yogurt,"" said Giffords. Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, patiently and quietly corrects her, saying ""yoga."" ""Yoga, yoga,"" Giffords repeats, offering a playful smile to signal she gets how funny it was that she said ""yogurt"" instead of ""yoga."" Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control . She has go-to phrases that indicate how she feels, often saying ""good stuff"" to express encouragement and ""whoa"" to show something excites her or makes her happy. The right-handed Giffords still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed. She generally wears a sling to keep it from flopping around. Her right leg is also paralyzed. She wears a large brace and literally drags her right leg with her good, left leg to walk. Still, she walks remarkably well. Giffords has a service dog -- Nelson, a golden lab -- with her at all times. She is also still aided by nurses, who come to her home, and by speech therapists, who constantly work with her to help improve her ability to communicate. She also doesn't see very well. 'Yes, it's tough': For Giffords, a wounded life has a new purpose . ""Not great at all,"" is how she described her vision. Giffords has limited sight in both eyes, no peripheral vision to the right. Kelly jokes that when he wants to sneak up on her he will come around the right so she can't see him coming. That makes Giffords giggle. It is clear watching the couple interact that humor helps keep her spirits up and eases the pressure of their intense daily struggle. For Kelly and Giffords, this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together. She was a bright young political rising star and he was an astronaut. Kelly said it is ""different in a lot of good ways."" The biggest difference? For the first time, they actually live in the same house, in the same city, in the same state. Before Giffords was shot, she jetted between her home in Tucson and work in Washington, while Kelly lived and worked in Texas, home of Johnson Space Center. They had a commuter marriage, which didn't allow them much time together. Now, they are together all the time, living in a ranch-style home they bought last summer. And since January, the two have worked together as well. They started Americans for Responsible Solutions, an organization and super PAC dedicated to pushing Giffords' former colleagues in Congress to support new restrictions to help curb gun violence. Giffords and Kelly own guns, and CNN filmed Kelly taking target practice with the same kind of gun Jared Loughner used to wound Giffords and kill six other people. Giffords says she would like to learn to shoot again, but it's not a high priority. When asked about the National Rifle Association's argument that the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" Giffords becomes animated. ""It doesn't work!"" she says. ""It doesn't work."" She says if she were still in Congress, she would have supported new gun-control legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Giffords' work and her recovery are not unrelated. Those around her said she has noticeably made more progress with her speech and physical challenges over the past few months since she re-engaged in the world of politics and public policy. Kelly said Giffords does have moments of frustration, but both insist she is mostly optimistic and not resentful. ""No. Move ahead,"" said Giffords. ""Move ahead.""

"(CNN) -- Debra Lafave, the former Florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student, violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker, a Florida judge found Thursday. Debra Lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager. She is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18. But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was ""not willful and substantial."" ""Please don't come back,"" he scolded. Dressed in a tailored, black pantsuit, Lafave said she had ""innocent"" physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18.  Watch Lafave in the courtroom » . At the time, she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at Danny Boy's, a small restaurant in the Tampa, Florida, area. Lafave, 27, pleaded guilty in November 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation. Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors. A tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court, prompting the prosecutor to observe, ""I think she's accounted for."" Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation. She referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just ""girl talk."" Lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers. ""I don't speak that way about my personal life,"" she said. But she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a ""small group setting."" While other co-workers socialized outside work, Lafave said, the 17-year-old was not included in those outings. Asked why she hugged the young co-worker, Lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family. The contact came, she said, ""out of my good nature, that's the way it worked."" The contacts that led to Thursday's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of Lafave's court-ordered supervision. She received a verbal reprimand a year ago, according to testimony. When the behavior continued, her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation. She was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother's beauty shop. In the past, Lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment.

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State assistant football coach Mike McQueary, who testified that he saw Jerry Sandusky in a shower with an underage boy, filed a whistleblower lawsuit Tuesday against the university, according to a court document from Centre County, Pennsylvania. McQueary was a key prosecution witness and was the only individual -- excluding the victims themselves -- who said he witnessed an apparent sexual encounter between Sandusky and a boy. Sandusky, who has maintained his innocence, was convicted in June for abusing young boys over a 15-year-period. In support of McQueary's whistleblower claim, the lawsuit states he was the only assistant football coach who was not invited to interview for employment with the incoming new head football coach after longtime coach Joe Paterno was fired amid the Sandusky scandal. Victim 1 sues Penn State over Sandusky abuse . McQueary also claims he was the only former employee who was not reimbursed for legal fees, and that he did not receive his severance payments on time. The lawsuit states McQueary believes those situations and his employment termination were the result of his cooperation with authorities in the Sandusky case. Read details of the lawsuit (PDF) According to the lawsuit, after testifying in court, McQueary was placed on administrative leave with pay in November 2011, only to later be terminated in July 2012.

"By . Helen Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 05:36 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:51 EST, 17 May 2013 . Shane Rattenbury had a close encounter with a kangaroo during his morning jog and came away with deep scratches and bruising . An Australian politician has been attacked by a kangaroo on his morning jog. Shane Rattenbury, a minister in the Australian Capital Territory government, almost collided with the eastern grey kangaroo, which was grazing on a front lawn in a Canberra suburb. 'We both got a nasty fright, and of course when kangaroos are startled, they lash out,' Mr Rattenbury said. 'As the kangaroo sought to escape, it landed on me, and its claws dug into my leg.' Mr Rattenbury, 41, says the 4ft 7in kangaroo left him with two deep scratches to his left leg and bruising to his right leg. Moments later, a passer-by spotted the minister on the ground in Ainslie and drove him home. He was taken to hospital and given a tetanus shot. 'The nurse who treated me had treated someone before who had been scratched by a kangaroo and ended up with a very bad infection,' he said. 'So she was quite keen to give it a good clean-out.' Mr Rattenbury arrived at the ACT parliament yesterday three hours after his encounter, and found most of his colleagues were more concerned about the kangaroo's welfare than his. 'I can assure people that the kangaroo is fine,' he said. 'It was last seen hopping off into the distance quite comfortably.' He posted a picture of his injuries to his Twitter page and assured his followers that the mugger had not made off with his wallet or watch. Mr Rattenbury, who was running as part of his triathlon training, posted a picture of the scratches on Twitter . Kangaroos are among Australia's most loved native species, featuring alongside an emu on the nation's coat of arms. But there are so many kangaroos around Canberra that the ACT government maintains a controversial culling program to contain them. Mr Rattenbury, who is a member of the Greens party, said he accepts the scientific evidence that kangaroo numbers have to be controlled around Canberra. 'Without a predator, kangaroos have . increased their abundance and have a detrimental impact on the rest of . the ecosystem,' he said. 'The Greens have not opposed that cull. 'I . really enjoy seeing kangaroos and we're very lucky in Canberra to have . them as part of our neighbourhoods, but I usually prefer to keep them at . a bit more of a distance than this,' he said. Mr Rattenbury told CNN the encounter had not put him off running and he intended to be out the next day to continue with his triathlon training. Kangaroos . rarely harm people, although in 2009 one jumped through a bedroom . window of a Canberra home late at night and terrorised a family before a . householder wrestled it out the front door. The 4ft 7in eastern grey kangaroo skipped away unhurt from the collision (file photo) Wildlife veterinarian Karen Vickers said more kangaroos were likely to venture deeper into Canberra suburbs in search of watered lawns to feed in the drier months ahead and that people should be wary. 'It sounds like they startled each other and Shane came off worse,' she told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. 'They're really not out to get us.'","Shane Rattenbury collided with the 4ft 7in kangaroo in a Canberra suburb .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just before Lois Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions in front of a House committee investigating wrongdoing in the IRS tax-exempt office she ran, she gave an opening statement insisting her innocence. ""I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules and regulations,"" said Lerner at the hearing. She has since been placed on administrative leave. But that statement angered Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and others on the committee, causing him Thursday to threaten to recall Lerner and force her to answer his questions, believing she had, in fact, waived her constitutional rights. What it means to take 'The Fifth' ""She just testified. She just waived her Fifth Amendment right to privilege,"" South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, said to applause during Wednesday's hearing. ""You don't get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination. That's not the way it works."" Issa agreed. ""After consulting with counsel, Chairman Issa has concluded that Ms. Lerner's Fifth Amendment assertion is no longer valid. She remains under subpoena, the Committee is looking at recalling her for testimony,"" Oversight committee spokeswoman Becca Glover Watkins told CNN Thursday in a statement. Issa's office declined to explain what his counsel's legal basis was for deciding that her Fifth Amendment assertion is no longer valid. But Democrats and several legal experts think Issa was wrong. ""I'm surprised that chairman Issa's taken that position,"" Ranking House Oversight Committee Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland told CNN on Thursday. ""First, all the law that I've read says that she did not waive her right. As a lawyer I don't believe she waived her right. And I believe that we as a committee should honor one's right, and as a matter of fact."" Some legal experts agree. ""The only true ways to ""lose"" one's rights under the Fifth Amendment are, one, for a court to find that the claimant does not have a reasonable fear of prosecution, because nothing she says could in fact become a helpful link to a prosecution, or two, to get an order of immunity that guarantees that nothing she says will in fact be used to prosecute her,"" said Miguel A. Estrada, a conservative attorney who helps head the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's appellate and constitutional group and who was once nominated by President George W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals. ""The first is unlikely here, and no one is offering to do the second."" It is true that high-profile congressional hearings are equal parts official proceeding and political spectacle. And the very act of being called to testify before Congress can create an impression of guilt in the court of public opinion, even though the congressional panel isn't issuing any kind of legal ruling. In these instances, it might be best to show up with an attorney for the benefit of appearances for the folks back at home watching on television, but plead the ""Fifth"" on sticky legal questions. But even in front of Congress, experts say, a witness doesn't necessarily lose Fifth Amendment protections by speaking first. ""One can invoke the Fifth Amendment at any time. Giving a preamble or any kind of statement doesn't void that,"" said Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, an associate professor who teaches constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. ""Now does it look suspicious? Yes. Does it undermine the person's credibility? Yes."" Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, retired Lt. Col. Oliver North, baseball player Mark McGwire and White House party crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi all invoked Fifth Amendment privilege before Congress due to concerns that anything they may have said could have been used against them in court. And, like Lerner, many of them offered some type of statement before or after taking The Fifth. ""I think what she did was unconventional,"" said Samidh Guha, a former federal prosecutor who now practices at the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP. ""But it's hyper technical to say she waived her Fifth Amendment privilege."" CNN's Dana Bash and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","Lawmakers, constitutional scholars debate whether Lois Learner waived the ""Fifth""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian lawmakers cast ballots Thursday to elect a new president for the South Asian democracy, with the ruling party's candidate considered the almost-certain winner. That candidate, Pranab Mukherjee, is a veteran politician and a former finance minister. Mukherjee's rival is opposition-backed candidate P.A. Sangma, a former speaker of the Indian parliament. Indian presidents are elected through an electoral college made up of more than 4,800 federal and state lawmakers. The result from Thursday's vote are expected to be announced Sunday.

Still, the Indian presidents, in their largely ceremonial position, hold considerable power as the supreme commander of the country's armed forces and custodian of the national constitution, political commentator K.G.

""Now we have a coalition era. We do not know in 2014, when the parliament election takes place, which party would be able to get a clear majority,"" Suresh said.

"(CNN) -- On the cover of their new book, ""You Have No Idea: A Famous Daughter, Her No-Nonsense Mother, and How They Survived Pageants, Hollywood, Love, Loss (And Each Other),"" singer/actress Vanessa Williams and her mother, Helen, radiate an empowered sophistication. Their pose eschews the clichÃ© embrace. Instead they strike a stance of support -- mother and daughter side by side, arms hooked. The book intertwines their two stories, how each has struggled on her own and how the complicated relationship that binds them still supplies a safety net. From public scandal -- she stepped down as the first black Miss America after nude photos of her appeared in Penthouse magazine -- to Broadway triumph, Williams has been on the celebrity radar for decades. Through it all, her mother has been a touchstone of humor and support in good times and bad. CNN sat down with both women to discuss their book, their parenting revelations and their memories from a lifetime in the spotlight. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation. CNN: How has your relationship evolved over time? Helen: Well, as Vanessa has grown into womanhood and become a mother, it's a more adult-to-adult relationship now, rather than the domineering mom, as they tend to think I was, to a more relaxed relationship but understanding that I'm still a mother in the relationship. Vanessa: As a mother now of four children, I can see her much more wholly as a woman, a mother, someone who has had a past and someone whose past has influenced her choices as well as mine. The wiser you get, the more experience you have, and the more you see people for who they are as human beings, as opposed to figures you have to fight against. I think I am much more conscious of back story, temperament and even going through perimenopause and how it can affect your mood, attitude and relations and how you deal with people. There are a lot of things that you don't realize that your parents are going through when you're a kid. CNN: How did you 'survive' all of that together? Helen: (Her father and I) were the support that we felt she needed to survive some of the things that she had to deal with that were not always the positive things. And we were also the supporters when something really exciting happened, like when she had her first Broadway show. Vanessa: And it's never-ending, especially in this business. You're always going to have people that are naysayers, that don't believe in your talent, that don't believe that you have any kind of longevity. I am happy to be able to look back -- because the book is called ""You Have No Idea,"" and every time there has been a major triumph in my career, nobody ever expected it. On Broadway: ""I didn't know she could sing and dance."" A No. 1 hit on the radio: ""I had no idea that she could be a recording artist."" With ""Ugly Betty"" and three Emmy nominations: ""I had no idea she was funny."" It is always redefining who you are and raging against the machine. CNN: What do you think mothers and daughters will take away from this book? Vanessa: I hope that they see that it's not all peaches and cream. Even when we shot the cover -- they had shown me the cover of Ellen Degeneres' book with her mom, and it was warm, loving and toasty, and they are embracing each other. And I said, ""That's not us!"" In the back of the book, you see me crowning her, because she is the real queen in our family. And so there is a sense of humor, which is part of our dynamic, and that's how we get through lots of things in our life. Helen: What I hope they take away is it's an honest story of two experiences, two different people with two different personalities, and how we were able to respect our roles as a mother and daughter and tell the story that worked for us with support, love, caring and being there for your child. CNN: What did you want for Vanessa? Helen: We wanted her to be whatever she chose to be as her life goal. To support her, doing whatever we could to make it happen. To be a happy, successful person. Vanessa: I also think, had I not been talented in the arts and I still wanted to be in it, they would have said ""Why don't you do something else?"" Luckily they saw my talent and my interest in it and they gave me all the gifts to allow me to take dance class, piano and French horn and be in theater and major in musical theater in college, rather than saying, ""Why don't you do something normal?"" or ""Get a real job."" I never heard that. CNN: As a mother now, do you hear yourself saying things that sound like your mother? Vanessa: When I heard it loud and clear was when I was on location shooting a show called ""Who Do You Think You Are."" I was on the phone with my 11-year-old daughter. She started with violin, played piano and percussion, then she wanted to switch to the trumpet, and then wanted to drop it altogether. I remember saying, ""We don't drop our instruments in this family. Everyone takes an instrument until they graduate, and that's what we do as a family, so you've got to figure out if it's violin or trumpet or something else. And I don't ever want to hear the music teacher telling me you're not showing up again."" And that's when I knew, I am the same parent, I have heard this before. CNN: How would each of you describe that relationship between mother and daughter? Vanessa: I am lucky to have three daughters who are completely different. I look at my daughters and I have different relationships with all three and there are parts of each personality that are very special. I rely on them for their particular qualities, but I feel happy that I have three completely different opportunities to make my mommy-daughter relationship different. Helen: And mine was such trial and error before Vanessa was born. I had no skills in diaper changing or feeding or any of the things that you're required to do as a mother. I enjoyed having a girl -- the mother-daughter shopping, dressing up and doing those things together. There'll be difficult times, especially when girls start growing up, and it's not easy, but you get through it. You just have to be patient and give them their space and recognize who they are. CNN: Is there a moment between you two that stands out as unforgettable? Helen: For me, it was when Vanessa had performed ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" on Broadway, because we knew that was one of the things that she wanted to do her entire life. Her high school picture said ""I'll see you on Broadway."" It was something that she'd worked very hard toward. She had some people that did not want her to be on Broadway, and she persisted. Vanessa: I think one of my mother-daughter memories was at the first state dinner that I attended, when President Reagan invited me to the White House that October as Miss America, and my mother said, ""Whatever you do, get the president to sign the menu!"" I ended up sitting at his table and trying to think, how am I going to get through this dinner with the president and get him to sign my menu? I listened to him talk about his life in Hollywood and towards the end, I said ""Can you please sign this menu for my mother? She will kill me otherwise."" And he very politely did it, and she still has it. The things that you do for your mother! Helen: But they're important things.","Vanessa Williams and her mother, Helen, have a new book out for Mother's Day .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- For many U.S. veterans it's a trip they thought they'd never take; returning to South Korea, the land where so many of their brothers-in-arms lost their lives. A mist hangs in the surrounding hills of the South Korean National Cemetery as dozens of returning veterans gather to honor the dead. It's a difficult but necessary journey for most of them as they commemorate the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the fighting in the Korea War. ""I was in the Pork Chop Hill in July 1953 and I remember the sounds of artillery and fighting. That is not something that you will forget. I never intended to come back to Korea. It's not like I didn't like the country but just didn't need to see it,"" says U.S. veteran Danny Peters. Almost two million Korean civilians lost their lives during the war as well as more than 200,000 South Koreans and about 36,000 American soldiers by the time the ceasefire was declared in 1953.

A lone bugler plays taps as men in their 80s, many dressed in military regalia complete with medals and ribbons, march towards an altar of incense and flowers to honor the dead. Some veterans now need canes and wheelchairs to help them complete the 40-meter stretch. Sixty years on, they aren't the strapping teenagers they once were, the years show in the wrinkles crisscrossing their faces but the memories are still fresh. ""The Korean War was very dangerous and I lost a lot of friends,"" says veteran Daniel Arthur. ""I remember all the battles I was in. I lost a lot of friends and saw a lot of people wounded."" For infantryman Philip DiMenno it's a journey he wanted to share with his two daughters, son and granddaughter. For him, it was about closing a chapter in his life, but for his children it was a chance to understand what the war was like. It's DiMenno's first time back since he left the peninsula in 1954. Long gone are the dirt roads and huts. Asphalt and high-rises have taken their place. But the memories of a young, scared 18-year-old rush back among the tombstones. Read more: Cosmetic change but no reform in N. Korea . ""I wanted to do the real thing. When I'm saying do the real thing that was just a figure of talk at that time, because in all fairness I was a very, very scared kid and I had a lot of fear in me,"" says DiMenno. The lively 81-year-old widower's memory doesn't fail as he recalls in descriptive detail to his family the two years he spent in South Korea. ""To be with him here now... I can see a huge difference in his emotions and how trying to gather everything that happened it's unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable,"" says DiMenno's granddaughter, Sara Zepezauer. His daughter, Renee DiMenno-Zepezauer, added: ""The great connection and almost a closure for my father to see a country in such despair and to see a country again with such prosperity."" The thought of the war has brought up mixed emotions from the veterans. Some of them express anger, sorrow and fear but most come to the same general conclusion. Read more: Talking peace with a backdrop of war . ""It (the Korean War) was pain in the ass. It disrupted a lot of lives of the Americans and lives of the Koreans. At the time, you always wondered if it was worth it. To think about it now, it accomplished a lot to the region and the world's order."" ""Don't tell the veterans that the war was nonsense,"" says DiMenno with a sense of defiance and pride. ""It stopped the spread of communism in Asia."" The ceremony honoring the dead doesn't last long, less than a half hour. The veterans salute the memorial, pour incense into a smoldering pot flanked by two giant statues and say their silent prayers. But for DiMenno it can't last long enough. ""We were never told to cry and it makes you cry because we are the survivors. We are just a little patch of what we did. Sure we survived for our country. The people who died should have these honors.""","U.S. veterans return to South Korea to remember fallen comrades .

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- In an audio statement made while he sits in a jail cell awaiting sentence, convicted pedophile Jerry Sandusky says that while others make him out to be a monster, he is a falsely accused man who will continue to protest his innocence. ""They could take away my life, they could make me out as a monster, they could treat me as a monster, but they can't take away my heart,"" the former coach at Penn State says. ""In my heart, I know I did not do these alleged disgusting acts."" Sandusky co-counsel Karl Rominger confirmed the audio statement is legitimate. ""If he wants to say that, God bless the First Amendment,"" Rominger said. Penn State University's ComRadio first aired the audio clip on its website Monday evening. Sandusky, a 68-year-old former defensive coordinator who ran a charity after he retired from coaching, faces up to life in prison. He is scheduled to be the final speaker at a sentencing hearing Tuesday. ""We will continue to fight,"" he said in the audio statement. ""We didn't lose the proven facts, evidence, accurate locations and times. Anything can be said. We lost to speculation and stories that were influenced by people who wanted to convict me."" McQueary files whistleblower suit . Sandusky needs to confess his guilt, said an attorney for the person identified in court as Victim No. 4. ""One thing that's critical for victims' healing is an acknowledgment of guilt. (Sandusky) is stunting that healing,"" attorney Ben Andreozzi. ""He is either delusional, or the victim of one of the most comprehensive conspiracies of mankind."" Another victim's attorney, Tom Kline, said the lack of contrition was to be expected. He called the statement ""sad and unfortunate."" The attorney for a man who claims he was repeatedly sexually abused by Sandusky while a child said the statement is a reminder that child predators justify their actions. ""Pedophiles often believe they did not do anything wrong. In their twisted universe, they helped their victims and loved them,"" said Marci Hamilton, an attorney for Travis Weaver, now 30. Weaver did not testify in Sandusky's trial, but did file a civil action against the former coach. It has been nearly a year since the Penn State scandal erupted, leading to the firing of iconic head football coach Joe Paterno and the ouster of the university's longtime president. Jurors determined in June that Sandusky used his access to university facilities and a foundation he founded for under-privileged youth to sexually abuse 10 boys over a 15-year period. His attorney, Joe Amendola, said Monday that his client, who is being held in the Centre County, Pennsylvania, jail, plans to read a statement before the court. Sandusky's statement should take five to 10 minutes, he said, but likely will steer clear of the argument he failed to receive a fair trial. On Monday the judge made it clear sentencing wouldn't be the place for such legal arguments, Amendola said. On June 22, Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. His attorneys will have 10 days after the sentencing to appeal the decision. At least of three of Sandusky's victims are expected to be in attendance on Tuesday, according to their attorneys. Two of them plan to address the former coach directly, while the third is expected to have a statement read by prosecutors. The statement from Victim No.4 ""will convey anger,"" said Andreozzi said. ""He is nowhere near forgiving Sandusky."" Members of Sandusky's family, including his wife, Dottie, will submit letters of support to the court as will some of the former participants in the Second Mile foundation, Amendola said. Penn State fans vow to support team . During the trial, which garnered national attention and cast a shadow on Penn State's heralded football program, the 23-year-old victim testified that he was only 13 when Sandusky sexually abused him in a university shower. That account is separate from a 2001 incident about which graduate assistant Mike McQueary testified, saying that he saw the former coach pressed up against the back of a boy in the shower room of the Lasch Football Building. Prosecutors described during the trial how Sandusky showered with the boy, using locker room ""soap fights"" as a pretext for abuse. Sandusky's attorneys say they plan to appeal the guilty verdict, and will argue that the jury's opinions had been tainted by a prosecution reference to a disturbing interview their client did with NBC's Bob Costas prior to the trial. Members of the defense team have also maintained that they were denied sufficient time to prepare. Less than a month after Sandusky's conviction, former FBI Director Louis Freeh released his university-funded report that blamed Paterno, President Graham Spanier, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz for taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. When a hero falls off a pedestal . Freeh also said Paterno could have stopped the attacks had he done more, though neither McQueary, Sandusky nor Paterno -- who died in January -- were interviewed by his investigators. Attorneys for Spanier blasted the review, calling it a ""blundering, indefensible indictment"" and ""a flat-out distortion of facts"" that was ""infused with bias and innuendo."" In July, the NCAA imposed sanctions against Penn State, including a $60 million fine, scholarship reductions, the vacating of 112 wins, five years' probation and a bowl ban for four years.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Well that's that. After one week of mingling with elite Party loyalists, China's Communist leaders have wrapped up their 18th National Congress. The next will be in five years time when the presumptive new president -- Xi Jinping -- delivers his thoughts on the challenges, ambitions and threats facing the world's most populous country. Read our live blog for the latest on China's new leaders . His predecessor Hu Jintao fired a flare on the first day of the Congress about the threat of corruption and its power to potentially bring down China's Communist regime. ""If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state,"" he told delegates. China's next leaders: Who's who . CNN asked five experts to explain what they see to be China's most pressing challenge. It's by no means a complete list, presented in no particular order. 1. Factional divisions . Plenty of analysis has accompanied this year's Congress as to the fine -- and not so fine -- lines that split the ideologies and loyalties of the members of the Politburo Standing Committee. But will any fracture lines be enough to tilt the Party towards reform? China commentator Willy Lam weighs in, noting that ""even before the birth of the People's Republic in 1949, factions within the party had fought over the future direction of the country."" The ""struggle between two lines"" during Mao's rule has morphed into divisions according to family ties to revolutionary leaders and guidance from powerful mentors. ""Since the early 1990s, three major factions have emerged within the party: the Shanghai faction led by ex-president Jiang Zemin, the Communist Youth League (CYL) faction led by President Hu Jintao, and the ""Gang of Princelings"" -- a reference to the offspring of party elders -- led by president-in-waiting Xi Jinping. What's the potential for one to win out?  Lam explains. 2. More spending, less saving . In 2011, a team of researchers led by economist Li Gan started asking questions to compile the most comprehensive study so far of household wealth in China. They found that the top 10% of income earners are sitting on most of the wealth. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Gan explains here what China needs to do. 3. Pouring water on disputes . Don't expect China to turn the other cheek when it comes to regional disputes, writes Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt from International Crisis Group. ""Beijing is keen to prevent the world from concluding that China has discarded the notion of a peaceful rise,"" Kleine-Ahlbrandt writes. She says China's going down the path of ""reactive assertiveness."" One example is China's attitude in response to Japan's purchase of islands disputed by both countries in the East China Sea. Find out whether Kleine-Ahlbrandt thinks the country's new leaders are likely to change tact. 4. Too many men . Faced with a surging population, China attempted to put the brakes on procreation in the late 1970s by implementing a controversial policy limiting couples in some areas to just one child. Since then, a cultural bias towards male children has led to a skewed child sex ratio where millions of men, or ""bare branches"" face an uncertain future due to the lack of potential female partners, writes evolutionary biologist Rob Brooks. ""It would be difficult to overstate the urgent need for China to emulate South Korea in eliminating sex-biased abortion and neglect,"" Brooks writes. Studies show, he says, what can happen if it doesn't. 5. Learning the three Rs . The legacy of China's powerhouse of cheap, labor-intensive exports is a natural environment tainted by the pollutants of economic growth. Author Geoff Hiscock says securing the food, water and air security of China's 1.35 billion people is one of the leadership's biggest challenges. ""Beijing and other parts of northeastern China are already water-stressed, the air quality in inland mega-cities such as Chongqing and Chengdu is abysmal, farming land is being poisoned by toxic runoff from mining and industrial activities, acid rain blights large parts of south China, contagious disease is an ever-present risk among its livestock, and unscrupulous makers sell tainted foodstuffs,"" Hiscock writes. So what can China do about it? More from Hiscock. CNN's Kevin Voigt and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","Experts explain what they think is China's biggest challenge .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Hours after it snapped power lines, overturned cars and ripped away bamboo homes, the most powerful cyclone to hit India in years weakened Sunday, but not before it left at least 14 dead. Morning light revealed damage from Tropical Cyclone Phailin after it pounded the eastern coast, the strongest storm in India in 14 years. Debris littered wet streets. Buildings had gaping holes where roofs and windows had been. In Odisha state, where the cyclone landed, at least 13 people were killed after trees fell and walls collapsed when the storm hit, Police Chief Prakash Mishra said. Another death was confirmed in Andhra Pradesh state, India's disaster management authority said. Many had feared the death toll would be higher. Massive evacuation efforts helped limit the number of casualties, officials said. ""It is a huge, huge relief,"" Naveen Patnaik, Odisha's chief minister, told CNN sister network CNN-IBN. ""Damage has been minimal."" But in the hardest hit areas, the storm's impact was clear, with flooded highways, fallen trees and downed power lines. As a precautionary measure, authorities cut the electricity in the affected districts. It could take up to a week to restore power, authorities said. Like a fierce hurricane . Hurricanes are known as cyclones in the Indian Ocean. At 140 mph wind speed, Phailin made landfall as the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. The strongest hurricane is a Category 5, which comes with winds greater than 155 mph. By Sunday, some 13 hours later, it was the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of about 80 mph. Where have all the hurricanes gone? 'Zero-casualty approach' India evacuated nearly a million people before the storm to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1999, when a cyclone killed 10,000 people. ""We have taken a zero-casualty approach,"" said Kamal Lochan Mishra, Odisha state's disaster manager. ""If people do not move, force will be used to evacuate them."" Phailin has brought nearly 8 inches of rain to Odisha's capital of Bhubaneswar, about 30 miles from the coast. The city's average rainfall for October is 6.5 inches. The storm will continue to fall apart as it moves over land, but tropical storm-force winds are still possible through early Monday, said CNN meteorologist Judson Jones. Rainfall will also be a problem as Phailin moves up toward the Himalayas in Nepal. Multiple states in the region were under weather warnings for excessive rainfall and thunderstorms. Hundreds of emergency shelters . About 900,000 were evacuated in Odisha alone. Most people in low-lying coastal areas of the state left on foot or by bicycle, Kamal Lochan Mishra said. Relocating evacuees is a major challenge because of property damage and losses caused by the storm, said Patnaik. Most are housed in nearly 250 emergency shelters set up in sturdy buildings like schools and government offices. The India Meteorological Department warned of extensive damage to houses made of flimsy materials like mud and bamboo, as well as damage to old buildings. The storm disrupted power and communication lines. Extensive flooding also affected rail and road traffic, and crops are likely to suffer major damage, the agency said. In Gopalpur, a coastal resort town in Ganjam, restaurants were shuttered and streets deserted. Tourists and local residents left the town. Military deployed . In October 1999, Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, killing 10,000 people. It was the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the Bay of Bengal, with winds of 155 mph at landfall. It caused more than $2 billion in damage. In advance of Phailin, military units and National Disaster Response Force personnel were deployed to coastal areas with relief supplies and medical aid, CNN-IBN said. All flights to Odisha have been canceled and train services in the state are also disrupted, CNN's sister network reported. Officials survey damage . As authorities surveyed the damage Sunday, they said food assistance would be provided to severely impacted villages. Teams from nonprofits were also canvassing the affected areas. Initial surveys indicate the damage was not as bad as many feared it could be, Save the Children said. But strong winds and heavy rains continued to pound some areas. ""There may be delays in being able to reach the most vulnerable families with aid,"" said Devendra Tak, a spokesman for the organization. ""This also means it could take some time before the full extent of the damage is known."" CNN's Neha Sharma and Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Mallika Kapur, Bharati Naik, Catherine E. Shoichet, Pedram Javaheri and Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","NEW: Save the Children: It could take time before the extent of damage is known .

"(CNN) -- Scott Asheton, who co-founded and played drums for the influential proto-punk band the Stooges, has died. He was 64. The death was disclosed by singer Iggy Pop, who formed the band with Asheton, Scott's brother Ron and Dave Alexander in 1967. ""My dear friend Scott Asheton passed away last night,"" Pop wrote Sunday on Facebook, not mentioning the cause of death. ""Scott was a great artist, I have never heard anyone play the drums with more meaning than Scott Asheton. He was like my brother. He and Ron have left a huge legacy to the world."" Ron Asheton died in 2009. The Stooges were punk well before punk rock came along. At a time when even hard rock bands were putting forth a little peace and love, the Stooges were brash, forthright and polarizing, relying on the brute force of power chords and Pop's peanut-butter-smearing antics to establish a core of followers. ""Taking their cue from the over-amplified pounding of British blues, the primal raunch of American garage rock, and the psychedelic rock (as well as the audience-baiting) of the Doors, the Stooges were raw, immediate, and vulgar,"" Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote on Allmusic.com. Pop told CNN in 2010 that the sound happened partly by accident. The band was a little too ""studious"" in the early days, but after their manager ""pulled the plug on our rehearsal room,"" in Pop's telling, the singer started stalking the manager around the place. Pop's anger rubbed off on the Asheton brothers. ""When I did that, they played differently. Ron and Scott started playing really furiously, and we were rocking,"" he recalled. Iggy Pop roars with a renewed 'Power' The Ann Arbor, Michigan-formed band's first two albums, ""The Stooges"" (1969) and ""Fun House"" (1970), exemplified their sound. The songs were deliberately basic -- two- and three-chord sledgehammers with titles such as ""No Fun,"" ""Dirt"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog."" ""Artistically, what our group had to offer really was ahead of its time,"" Pop told CNN. The late Kurt Cobain of the grunge band Nirvana called the Stooges' 1973 album, ""Raw Power,"" his favorite album of all time. The band wasn't immune to its own behavior. The albums didn't sell, and drug abuse took its toll. After ""Raw Power,"" the Stooges broke up, and Scott Asheton joined several other bands. The Stooges reunited in 2003 and released a fourth album in 2007. The Stooges were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. Social media responded to Asheton's death. ""Deeply (saddened) by the loss of my mate #ScottAsheton,"" wrote photographer Mick Rock on Twitter, who was very much a part of the '70s scene. ""We all lost a hell of a drummer today. Scott Asheton of the Stooges is gone. MC5, Lou Reed, Iggy... These bands changed me and changed music,"" tweeted actor Linden Ashby. Asheton is survived by his wife, Liz, and a daughter, Leanna.

"(CNN) -- Teena Marie, a celebrated R&B singer-songwriter, was found dead Sunday at her California home, her manager said. Born Mary Christine Brockert in Santa Monica, California, the 54-year-old artist famously paired with late funk legend Rick James and was nominated four times for a Grammy Award, according to her official website. Marie was found dead by her daughter after apparently dying in her sleep, manager Mike Gardner said. ""Teena was a black voice trapped in a white body,"" said Cathy Hughes, founder of Radio One, a broadcasting company that targets African-American and urban listeners. ""I would always tell her that she was one of the greatest vocalists of our time."" Among her songs were ""Lovergirl,""  ""Portuguese Love,"" ""Ooo La La La,"" and ""I'm a Sucker for Your Love."" While no cause of death has been released, the singer's publicist Lynn Jeter said that Marie suffered a grand mal seizure -- a neurological event, marked by loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions, according to the Mayo Clinic -- a month ago. ""Luckily, someone was there,"" Jeter said of that seizure. ""The ambulance took her to the hospital, and on the way she had another seizure."" The publicist said that she had a ""great"" conversation on Saturday with Marie, who told her that she was excited about heading to Atlanta to perform this week -- in what would have been her first performance since the seizure. Marie sang under various record labels, including Motown, Epic, Stax Records and Cash Money Classics, since bursting on the scene as a 19-year-old, according to her website. Her last studio album, Congo Square, featured several collaborations. ""I am horrified by the sudden death of my darling Teena Marie,"" Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement sent by his publicist.  ""She was my 'baby,' always true to herself, always true to her heart."" Berry called her  a ""powerhouse performer, writer, producer and arranger."" ""When I first auditioned her she was so awesome she blew me away,"" Gordy said.  ""She had so much soul -- the only thing white about her was her skin."" ""The enduring influence of Teena's inspirational, trailblazing career, could only have been made possible through her brilliant song-writing, showmanship and high energy passion which laid the ground work for the future generations of R&B, hip-hop, and soul,"" said Gene Rumsey, chief label officer with Concord Music Group.  ""We feel extremely fortunate to have worked with a visionary who changed music in indelible ways."" Eddie Levert, founder of the vocal group The O'Jays, praised Marie as both a singer and mother.

"(CNN) -- Law enforcement officials in southern California searched urgently Wednesday for a 3-year-old boy who was kidnapped at gunpoint during a weekend home invasion. Briant Rodriguez, 3, was taken by armed men during a home invasion in San Bernardino, Caifornia, police say. Two men broke into a house in the San Bernardino area on Sunday and tied up the boy, Briant Rodriguez, his mother and other siblings. They ransacked the house and fled with the boy, authorities said. One of the children freed himself and untied the rest of the family, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The boy's father was at work at the time, KTLA said. An Amber Alert was issued late Sunday. Sheriff's deputies in San Bernardino County released composite sketches of the suspects during a news conference on Tuesday.  Watch how the boy was taken at gunpoint » . Sheriff's officials said they placed the boy's picture on billboards along the U.S.-Mexican border and have followed up on half of 80 or so leads from the Amber Alert tip-line.

Officials said the kidnappers have not contacted authorities or the parents. At the news conference, the boy's mother, Maria Millan, held her son's T-shirt and begged that he be released. ""My son, my son, my pretty son,"" she said. Millan said she told the kidnappers ""I don't owe you a thing"" and has said she didn't know the men. There has been speculation that the boy's abduction was a case of mistaken identity or carried out by people involved with organized crime. Authorities say they have found no motive in the case, and they are not ruling out any possibility. They said the parents are not suspects. Hubbard, the sheriff's department's lead investigator in the case, said ""the family obviously has been very distraught."" ""Every second that goes by for us is critical,"" Hubbard said of the round-the-clock and robust investigation. He also added that in his 20-year career he has never experienced a case where a home-invasion robbery resulted in a kidnapping. Briant is described in the Amber Alert as a Hispanic male who was last seen wearing a yellow shirt with blue sleeves and blue-striped shorts with two different colors of blue. The boy's hair is longer than shoulder length. Both suspected kidnappers are Hispanic males -- one 5-feet, 5 inches tall, between the ages of 18 and 20 with a thin build, unknown hair and eye color, last seen wearing a black baseball hat, blue jeans and green T-shirt. The other is 5-foot-10, around age 24 with a thin build, black boots, a black shirt and a bandanna.","Police say the boy's abductors haven't contacted his family .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- President Barack Obama made an unannounced visit Friday to Afghanistan, where he delivered holiday greetings to U.S. troops stationed there and promised continued full support in the war against Taliban and other extremists. The president, who stayed for almost four hours before heading back to Washington, addressed nearly 3,900 troops at Bagram Airfield. Most of the troops were with the Army's 101st Airborne Division, though components of all the service branches were represented. ""I wanted to make sure that I could spend a little time this holiday with the finest fighting force the world has ever known,"" he told the enthusiastic audience. ""On behalf of more than 300 million Americans, we are here to say thank you."" The president praised the troops for what he characterized as recent military gains in the nine-year conflict. Our coalition ""is strong and is growing,"" he said. ""You're going on the offense (We're) tired of playing defense."" Obama visited a hospital on the base, where he met with five wounded soldiers and three wounded civilian contractors, reporters traveling with the president said. He awarded five Purple Hearts and met with the surviving members of a platoon that lost six comrades earlier in the week. Obama had originally planned to travel to Kabul to meet with President Hamid Karzai and greet U.S. Embassy staffers, but stayed at Bagram because of poor weather. He did, however, speak to Karzai for 15 minutes via secure videoconference. The president later huddled with National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, and Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. It was unclear whether U.S. concerns with the Karzai government publicized this week by the website WikiLeaks were discussed. Two of the cables paint an unflattering portrait of President Karzai's half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been accused of dealing drugs. Prior to the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, Petraeus met with the Afghan president in an effort to ease tensions. Karzai had told the Washington Post he would like to scale back the U.S. military presence in his nation, and criticized the military presence as ""intrusive"" while calling Special Operations raids a problem. In response, Petraeus told Karzai aides that the president's view could make his relationship with the United States ""untenable."" A major U.S. military review of the war in Afghanistan is due this month, a year after Obama ordered additional U.S. troops to the country as part of a strategy that could bring some forces home as soon as July 2011. Officials have said the goal is to end combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. Friday's trip was Obama's second to Afghanistan since he became commander-in-chief. He visited Afghanistan in 2008 as a presidential candidate.","NEW: Obama visit to Afghanistan lasts nearly four hours .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama defended his proposed education spending increases Friday, telling an audience of students and teachers in Florida that such investments are necessary to spur future economic growth. ""If we want more good news on the jobs front, then we need to make more investments in education,"" Obama said. ""I am not willing to give up on any child in America. ... I do not accept failure."" Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 includes an 11% hike in federal education spending, to more than $77 billion. Republican congressional leaders are seeking to reduce federal spending on education, with many arguing it should be primarily a state and local concern. Among other things, the administration has made a pledge to prepare an additional 100,000 science, technology, math and engineering teachers by the end of the decade. The White House also is pushing to make permanent the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which is worth up to $10,000 for four years of college. Seeking a political middle ground, Obama has also stressed the need for reform and, more specifically, the need to remove poorly performing teachers and school administrators. He continued to do so Friday, calling the status quo ""unacceptable."" At the same time, however, the president also appeared to criticize at Republicans such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is trying to strip teachers and other public sector workers of the bulk of their collective bargaining rights. Teachers are ""feeling beat up"" right now, Obama said. ""I want to be very clear here. We are proud of what (teachers) do each and every day. We need to honor teachers."" The president appeared with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, at Miami Central Senior High School -- a previously underperforming school which has improved in recent years. The turnaround, Obama stressed, was done by implementing a reform plan in cooperation with the local teachers union. White House officials noted that the school was awarded nearly $785,000 in federal School Improvement Grant funds to help finance its turnaround plan. Obama has asked Congress for $900 million for a new round in the Race to the Top competition, which rewards states and localities that meet the administration's standards for educational innovation and outcomes.","Obama says more education spending is needed to spur future economic growth .

"(CNN) -- RadarOnline released another audio recording Tuesday of a vicious argument allegedly between actor Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva, in which the man is accused of striking the woman and the couple's child -- an accusation the man does not deny. The website has been releasing similarly explosive recordings since July 9. It has not disclosed how it obtained the audio. The recordings are taken from a phone call and capture an obscenity-laced rant by the man as he spews racial and ethnic slurs, sexual insults and death threats. The site claims the male voice is that of the 54-year-old Gibson. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the recordings. In the recording released Tuesday, the woman tells the man he needs to seek help for his current mental state, referencing an earlier altercation between them while she was holding their child in her arms. ""You're acting as a crazy man right now and you have been for many, many months,"" the woman says. ""And you hit me, and you hit her while she was in my hands! Mel, you're losing your mind. You need medication."" The man responds with a slew of obscenities, and ends the rant by saying, ""I want my child, and no one will believe you."" Grigorieva, 40, has acknowledged that the female voice on the recordings is hers and that the other voice is Gibson's. CNN's efforts to obtain comment from Gibson have been unsuccessful. The couple have been locked in a custody dispute over their 8-month-old daughter. The Malibu Hills Police Department opened an investigation earlier this month into an alleged domestic violence dispute between Gibson and Grigorieva. Grigorieva filed a restraining order against Gibson alleging that he struck her in the face, according to her spokesman, Stephen Jaffe. The recordings ""will be part of the investigation,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said last week. It is not known how RadarOnline obtained the recordings. Jaffe has said that the site did not receive them from Grigorieva. Gibson came under fire in 2006 when he admitted to making anti-Semitic remarks during a drunken driving arrest. He issued an apology at the time, and appealed to the Jewish community to help him recover from his alcohol addiction.","The recording allegedly captures an argument between the actor and his ex-girlfriend .

"Chen Guangbiao wants rich people in China to give more to charity and he'll do anything to get their attention. That includes stacking piles of cash to form a wall for a photo op or dancing on the rooftops of brand new cars that he bought for a donation. Chen's latest stunt involved buying lunch for underprivileged people in New York City and giving each person a cash gift. The free lunch took place on June 25 at Loeb Boathouse in Central Park. ""I have visited the U.S. every month since last November, I see many homeless people, poor people on the streets, searching for food in the garbage bins,"" Chen said when asked why he was going all the way to the U.S. to carry out his philanthropy. Calling from his Shanghai office earlier this week, Chen spoke in an even, calm tone, without a hint of the goofball persona that he displays during his media events. Chen publicized the mass lunch with full-page ads in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, asking interested homeless people to sign up for the meal by email. When we spoke to the millionaire, he said more than 5,000 people had signed up for the June 25 lunch. He was working with several U.S. charities to decide on the final guest list. One of them, the New York City Rescue Mission, told CNN last week that the $300 cash gift is a prize for completing one of their training or substance abuse programs. Publicity with a purpose . Mission spokeswoman Michelle Tolson dismissed the idea that the event is a publicity stunt for Chen, saying they had vetted him. ""It's not something we wanted to get into lightly,"" she said, citing her organization's 142-year history. But for Chen, publicity is crucial. Handing out cash and buying lunches is not the long-term goal. The eccentric millionaire says he hopes to influence the rest of the world's rich and powerful to give more through his flashy charity antics, even though it makes him a target for ridicule. ""My wealth is very limited. I need to influence other people to give,"" says Chen, adding that those full-page ads in U.S. newspapers were written in both English and Chinese so that other well-heeled Chinese would get the message. The tycoon founded Jiangsu Huangpu Recycling Resources, an unlisted company that recycles construction material and domestic waste, but says that he ""could not even make it onto China's top 10,000 rich list."" Hurun has him at number 372 on their 2013 rich list, while Forbes reports Chen's fortune is worth the equivalent of $720 million (RMB4.5 billion ). 'Talk is cheap' Chen likes to tell the story of how his mother's selflessness inspired him. Growing up in a poor rural household, two of Chen's siblings starved to death. Despite their poverty, his mother found ways to give to others. ""She would carry my little brother at her side, he would be crying, but she would share her milk with other people's babies,"" says Chen. The self-made man said he did many odd jobs as a school kid, hauling trash, selling water and snacks, whatever he could to bring in extra cash. A graduate in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Chen says he invented an electronic device that detects illnesses in the body using TCM theories. The contraption made him his first fortune in the 1990s before he turned to the recycling industry. He made his mark nationally as a philanthropist when he appeared on the scene of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008. Changing his suit and tie for army fatigues, the bespectacled businessman pulled bodies out from the rubble and donated more than RMB 100 million (US$16 million). ""I like to get my hands dirty. Talk is cheap,"" he says. Chen has since traveled to the epicenter of other major natural disasters in China to do relief work -- and provide the media with great photo ops. In the spotlight . Despite his record, a lot of people can't take Chen seriously as a philanthropist. His critics include Jeremy Goldkorn, director of Chinese media research firm Danwei, who calls the millionaire ""a clown whose so-called philanthropy appears to consist entirely of self-promotional stunts."" Netizens ridicule Chen for his love of the media spotlight; some accuse him of being a fraud and say that his TCM diagnostic machine invented in the 1990s is a scam. Chen doesn't do himself any favors when he includes on his English namecard an absurdly long string of self-aggrandizing titles, including ""Most Charismatic Philanthropist of China,"" or when he widely publicizes his interest in buying the New York Times, only to have the Times deny any such possibility. The millionaire also seems to actively court political controversy. In 2011, he traveled to Taiwan -- considered a rogue state by Beijing -- to hand out more than $200,000 in cash to the disadvantaged, only to have local politicians hesitate to receive him, suspecting the trip may be a soft political move orchestrated by Chinese government. Chinese American media such as the Epoch Times and New Tang Dynasty TV have investigated Chen's ties to the Communist Party, suspecting him of unknowingly becoming a political pawn for certain factions of the party. Chinese-language media have also accused Chen of not fulfilling his million-dollar pledges -- allegations Chen has denied. Chen is a staunch patriot -- he is known for punctuating press conferences with solo renditions of patriotic songs, some using self-penned lyrics. He also took out an ad in the New York Times in 2012 proclaiming the disputed Diaoyu Islands are Chinese territory, not Japanese. But the recycling tycoon denies any connection with Chinese authorities and insists his record is clean. ""Starting my business has been very hard work. I have received no help from any officials at all. I still find it very difficult to get my business deals because I refuse to take or give bribes, I refuse to become corrupt,"" he says. Perhaps Chen's most controversial philanthropic venture was his pledge in early 2014 to fund plastic surgery for a mother and her daughter who reportedly survived self-immolation. The pair were allegedly part of a group of Falun Gong practitioners who are believed to have set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square in 2001. They survived the incident but were badly disfigured. Chen's move to bankroll their surgery was met with outrage from Falun Gong supporters who say that the incident was staged by the Chinese government and that the organization would never preach self harm or suicide. When he dies, Chen plans to donate his entire fortune not to his family, but to charity -- a pledge he says he was inspired to make after meeting Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010. Although his critics accuse Chen of never giving money to his relatives anyway. ""My younger brother runs a guesthouse and my sister is a janitor. I have not given them money because they earn their own money. I pay for their children's school fees,"" says Chen. Despite the criticism, Chen has not been discouraged. ""I regret nothing,"" he says. ""I am not afraid of what people say about me. I have not done anything that harms anyone. I think society needs diverse innovation. I will keep on giving positive energy through my creative solutions for problems.""","""I regret nothing. I am not afraid of what people say about me,"" says controversial philanthropist Chen Guangbiao .

"Washington (CNN) -- While acknowledging the hard-hit black community and budding criticisms in its ranks, President Barack Obama said in a speech Saturday night to the Congressional Black Caucus that he wouldn't give up -- and urged members of the black community to join him to jump-start the still-sluggish economy. ""I expect all of you to march with me, and press on,"" Obama said. ""... Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying. We are going to press on. We've got work to do."" The unemployment rate among African-Americans is 16.7%, nearly double the national average, while 40% of black children live in poverty. Such facts have made fiscal reforms a priority for caucus members, some of whom -- most of them Democrats -- have criticized Obama for not doing enough on the issue. They include Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who at a caucus ""jobs' tour town hall"" in Detroit this month described the unemployment rate among blacks ""unconscionable."" She said the strategy to fix it was unclear, adding that the caucus was ""getting tired"" of waiting for one. She questioned the president's decision to focus on the Midwest during a three-day jobs bus tour in August, stating that the 3 million who live in Iowa -- and are mostly white -- are roughly equal in number to the African-Americans who are out of work. She suggested that Obama's administration seemed more keen to focus on that politically important state than on the black community. ""Are the unemployed in the African-American community, including almost 45% of its youth, as important as the people of Iowa?"" she asked in the statement she released ahead of the president's speech before a joint session of Congress in which he announced his jobs plan. In his speech Saturday, Obama called the situation for many blacks ""heartbreaking, and it's frustrating."" But he also touted achievements of his administration -- such as on the earned income tax credit, anti-foreclosure programs and consumer financial protections -- for making a difference, while admitting more work lies ahead. ""In these hard years, we have won a lot of fights (and) we've done a lot of good,"" he said. ""But we've got more work to do. People are still hurting."" As to the criticism, the president said that ""nobody feels the burden more than I do."" But in a rousing end to his speech, he said he knew addressing problems wasn't going to be easy. One of the chief lessons from the civil rights movement is that ""you can't stop"" in the face of challenges, he said. ""The future rewards those who press on, with patience and determination,"" he said. ""Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes."" Obama promoted his recently proposed American Jobs Act during his speech, as well as his tax reform efforts to pay for the bill in part by closing loopholes and effectively having some wealthier Americans pay more in taxes than they do currently. As he did in a nationally televised speech several weeks ago, the president repeatedly used the phrase ""pass this jobs bill"" in promoting its various measures -- including efforts to bolster small businesses, rebuild schools and bridges, and hire back teachers, firefighters and police. In an apparent swipe at Republicans, he urged politicians to fight as hard ""for ordinary folks as you do for all your contributors."" ""We have to make sure that everyone in this country gets a fair shake, and a fair shot, and a chance to get ahead,"" he said. Obama insisted that having ""the folks who have benefited the most ... pay their fair share"" in taxes must be part of any solution, adding, ""This is all about fairness."" The president has proposed a $4,000 tax credit to employers for hiring long-term unemployed workers and higher credits to companies that hire veterans who have been unemployed for at least six months. He also wants to see unemployment insurance extended to prevent 5 million Americans from losing their benefits and stronger programs to help the long-term unemployed through counseling and job training. A number of caucus members -- including Chairman Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and fellow Democratic representatives like John Lewis of Georgia and Frederica Wilson of Florida -- released statements of support for the American Jobs Act after the president's speech, as did other black leaders, such as Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. Waters also praised the plan in TV interviews after the speech, though she said she and other caucus members wished the plan was ""even bigger"" and that she hoped the kind of help proposed would get to the people who need it most. More than anything, some black caucus members have said that it is imperative that Obama not only propose a plan, but stick to it. Some of the group's staffers have said they hope the White House learned from experiences in past bills, such as the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, an instance in which they claim the administration did not negotiate from a position of strength. One thing that the administration appears intent on doing is not ignoring black voters, which overwhelmingly supported him in his 2008 presidential bid. Obama recently met with black journalists and with the leaders of organizations that serve the community -- the NAACP's Ben Jealous, the National Urban League's Marc Morial and the Rev. Al Sharpton from the National Action Network. He also has taped an interview with BET Networks, set to air Monday, in which he is expected to specifically address the ""increase of unemployment among African-Americans since taking office, the current economic crisis, the political landscape around the 2012 presidential election"" among other issues, according to the network. At a panel this month with black media group Interactive One, one of the president's top advisers, Valerie Jarrett, called the unemployment rate in the black community ""unacceptably high"" and said the president understood that ""inaction is not an option."" In remarks to the panel, the president said 20 million African-American workers would benefit from his jobs bill proposal to cut the payroll tax in half, a measure he said would save the average family $1,500 a year. ""It helps out-of-work Americans, including the 1.4 (million) African-American folks and their families who are out of work, by extending unemployment benefits to help support them and their families while they're looking for work,"" the president said. ""And it also reforms the training programs that are available so that they can build real skills and connect to jobs. And that will particularly help the long-term unemployed.""","NEW: Obama stresses ""fairness,"" while admitting ""we've got more work to do""

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- After dumping intense rain and bringing strong winds to Haiti and Cuba on Saturday, Tropical Storm Isaac picked up steam -- and promised to pick up strength -- as it spun toward Florida. The storm left at least two people dead in the impoverished Caribbean nation of Haiti, pounding camps where hundreds of thousands of people live in tents. As the Haitian government and outside agencies continued to assess the damage, the focus surrounding Isaac increasingly turned toward Florida, much like the storm itself. Isaac was roughly 65 miles northeast of Camaguey, Cuba, and 340 miles east-southeast of Key West by late Saturday, moving at about 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm system is expected to gain strength and become a hurricane by early Monday as it moves past the Florida Keys and into the Gulf of Mexico. After barreling north -- affecting Florida's western coast along the way -- the storm is expected to pack 100 mph sustained winds by the time it makes landfall sometime late Tuesday afternoon or early evening on the Florida Panhandle, likely near Panama City, according to forecasters. That progression prompted Republican Party officials in Tampa to effectively push back Monday's scheduled start of the Republican National Convention one day, hoping the move will make it safer and easier for delegates to attend. Tropical storm conditions could first be felt there by late Sunday, and by late Monday afternoon and early evening, Isaac's eye should be west of the coastal city. Florida's governor, Rick Scott, insisted Saturday that his state will be ready for whatever happens. ""This is a state that has dealt with hurricanes forever,"" he told reporters Saturday in Broward County. ""We are a state that we know we have to get prepared for hurricanes."" As preparations continue, authorities in Haiti spent Saturday assessing Isaac's aftermath. The country is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that struck more than two years ago, and its challenges are compounded by the fact it is led by a relatively new government with limited resources. All that said, the top U.N. humanitarian official in the nation praised the initial response efforts. ""So far, I think we're faring reasonably well in our response,"" Kevin Kennedy told CNN on Saturday afternoon, referring to the efforts led by the Haitian government and assisted by U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. Haitian radio reported that the worst damage was in the country's southeast. Heavy rain and strong winds persisting into the morning hours caused visible damage to trees and houses in the city of Jacmel, on Haiti's southern coast, and knocked out power. As many as 1,500 of the city's residents took refuge in a school serving as a shelter. Jacmel Mayor Hugues Paul confirmed at least one death on the outskirts of his city, voicing fears that more deaths will be reported. A 10-year-old girl also died when a wall fell on her house in Thomazeau, near Port-au-Prince, the country's civil protection agency said. At the Mega IV camp, where 8,000 Haitians live in makeshift shelters, fallen trees and flooding damaged hundreds of tents. Almost no one had evacuated the camp before the storm, and authorities were searching the camp tent by tent looking for victims. At another camp, Canaan, half the tents were blown away, according to an official statement on the radio. Haiti's national electricity supplier at one point said that 30 out of the country's 32 electricity grids were down. Bernard Mevs Hospital was operating on generator power after losing electricity, just before midnight, said Scott Gillenwater of the Project Medishare, which provides services at the hospital. The nation's main airport closed for a time, but had reopened by late Saturday afternoon, according to Rachel Brumbaugh, operations manager in Haiti for the Christian humanitarian organization World Vision. In Port-au-Prince, people were evacuated to areas behind the presidential palace and also to a stadium. The storm dumped up to a foot of rain around Hispaniola -- the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic -- with up to 20 inches in some locales. Kennedy pointed out the prospect of another humanitarian disaster would have been much worse right after the 2010 earthquake, when about 1.5 million people were living in about 1,500 makeshift camps. Today, he said that figure is closer to 400,000. But Haiti may not be out of the woods yet, with the possibility of even more heavy rain causing a host of problems along the coast and in populated areas downhill from mountains. ""We could possibly get another 10 inches and, should that happen, we'd be very concerned about flooding in the low-lying areas and those places adjacent to the sea,"" Kennedy said. Water levels along the Grey River in Port-au-Prince are already ""at their breaking point,"" and more rain could cause them to overflow their banks and flood surrounding areas, Brumbaugh said. In Jacmel, residents fear that large amounts of rainfall may cause mudslides, runoff and severe flooding as it did several years ago. ""I'm very worried about the water coming off the mountains and that the city fills up like a sink,"" said Paul, the city's mayor. Isaac threatens destruction, cholera . After hitting Haiti, Isaac skirted eastern and central Cuba. Cuban officials reported some storm surge and flooding from rain in the far eastern part of the country, and about 200 people were said to be in shelters in the town of Baracoa. But thus far no major damage or injuries were reported. Strong wind gusts were also felt in Havana. After passing Cuba and getting back out over open water, Isaac is forecast to gain strength over the next 48 hours, the hurricane center reported. The Florida Keys, Florida Bay and the state's west coast, from Bonita Beach south to Ocean Reef, are under a hurricane warning. And a hurricane watch, first issued early Saturday, continued overnight for Florida's east coast from Golden Beach south to Ocean Reef. A watch means hurricane conditions are possible, and a warning means that hurricane conditions are expected. A tropical storm warning, meanwhile, was in effect overnight Saturday for Cuba's eastern provinces, most of the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, the east coast of Florida from Sebastian Inlet south to Ocean Reef and the west coast of Florida from Tarpon Springs south to Bonita Springs -- an area that includes Tampa. ""It has been a fortunate seven years since Wilma hit Florida,"" National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb said, referring to the last hurricane to make landfall in the state. ""The luck is going to run out at some point."" Scott declared a state of emergency for his state, which he said is ""standard protocol"" to ensure a well-coordinated response with local, state and federal agencies. Big storms like these are nothing to Floridians, the governor pointed out, and people are already working to get ahead of this one. In Key West, the southernmost point in the United States and likely the first part of the Sunshine State to be hit by Isaac, Mayor Craig Cates told CNN on Saturday that ""we're ready (and) we're confident that it's not going to be really bad."" Many storefront windows were boarded up, while hotels were largely vacant even though no orders or recommendations for evacuations had been issued. Some in Key West, though, suggested they were ready and eager to ride out the storm. ""We came down here to have a good time, we're not going to let a hurricane get in the way,"" Paul Cannella, a tourist from Chicago who is visiting the Keys. ""I am a big believer in lifetime experiences, (and) I've heard about hurricane parties, so we're going to have some fun with it."" Opinion: Wyclef Jean: What about Haiti?

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- I pitied the other tourists at the car rental lot at the Los Angeles airport: The sight of two Englishmen in their mid-30s sinking uncertainly into a white Mustang convertible is not pleasant. The car was not a natural fit for us. It was very low to the ground and had a mystifying set of buttons. This meant 20 minutes of painstaking trial and error as we grappled with how to work the roof, as if trying to break the Enigma code. But as alien as the muscle car was, it was vital to this trip to California, which was essentially to reclaim lost youth in an early midlife crisis. My companion and I had lived in Los Angeles after leaving university and were curious to see how it had changed. We then planned to drive along the coast to San Francisco, taking in some of California's wine-growing regions. This invited unkind comparisons to the movie ""Sideways,"" which sees aging college friends on a road trip drinking wine and navigating disaster. L.A. has some features that can deter tourists: It lacks a natural focal point, is dominated by roadways and has an abundance of depressing motels and fast-food joints. It also has Venice, a pocket of urban bohemia that has acted as a cultural center for decades. Developed in 1905 by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney, the area derives its name from the canals built to drain off the marshland. It was conceived as a family beach resort but fell into neglect. As real estate prices dropped, the area began to attract an eclectic mix of people. This instilled that bohemian DNA into Venice, which served as a rallying point for the Beat generation in the 1950s and remains an important artistic center. 10 top road trip apps . Much of Venice has hardly changed. The chaotic beachfront boardwalk is alive and well: Tattoo artists, head shops and fortune-tellers hawk their wares to a stream of human traffic, even in winter. We stayed in a free-wheeling art deco style hotel that looked like it had not changed in 40 years. Elsewhere, there are signs of inevitable gentrification. The memory of Venice's developer is preserved in Abbot Kinney Boulevard, a mile-long artery and focal point for residents and local businesses. I walked down the palm-lined street every day when I lived in Venice and always enjoyed its offbeat charm. It was a relief to see the hipsterish local coffee bar Abbot's Habit was still dosing the population and exhibiting local art. But around it, stylish galleries, boutiques and swanky condos now give the road a feeling of imposing wealth, resembling New York's Chelsea district -- certainly the chic end of Boho-chic. The neighborhood has become safer and cleaner, said Joshua Woollen, owner of Urbanic Paper Boutique. Gang-related activity has dropped, and ""what you have now are some of the most influential, creative, progressive and cutting-edge people living within a couple mile radius in one small beach community,"" Woollen said. ""When my wife and I first moved to Venice over 13 years ago, Abbot Kinney felt like a ghost town,"" he said. Perhaps the most dramatic change was seeing the property where I once lived in harder times. Once a teeming human zoo of chancers and borderline personalities, the three houses have been divided and sold. The rough neighborhood is now transformed into a quiet and sunny residential street. I would happily move back. Feeling considerably older already, we began the ""Sideways"" leg of the journey. Channeling the film, the car's top was lowered and we took off along the ravishing Pacific Coast Highway. Hugging California's coastline for 655 miles, the road offers the serenity and endless vastness of the Pacific Ocean as a backdrop. The terrain changes as you head north, taking in plains, craggy headlands and lush green hills that tumble down into the sea. All our heightened expectations were met and rewarded. An hour after leaving Los Angeles, we reached Santa Barbara County. Long overshadowed by the Napa region farther north, Santa Barbara was put on the wine tourist's map by the release of the Oscar-winning film in 2004. Its influence was immediate. ""Its timing created a tsunami of interest,"" says Jim Fiolek of the Santa Barbara Vintners Association. ""Recognition in not only Santa Barbara County, but wine in general, more specifically, Pinot Noir, which flourishes in Santa Barbara."" With mountain ranges running horizontally across the county, Santa Barbara channels ocean air into its valleys and has a cool climate. This geographical oddity makes it a natural home for Pinot Noir grapes, which can ripen too early in warmer temperatures. As one ""Sideways"" character explains in loving tones: ""It's not a survivor like Cabernet, which can just grow anywhere and uh, thrive even when it's neglected. No, Pinot needs constant care and attention. You know? And in fact it can only grow in these really specific, little, tucked-away corners of the world."" At first, the region struggled to cope with the surge in interest generated by the film: Tasting rooms were hastily built on vineyards, leading to a jump in sales. By 2008, wine makers were selling directly to customers some eight times as much as they were selling in 2000. Santa Barbara is a natural target for a day trip from Los Angeles and has the inevitable ""Sideways"" tour guide for visitors, which generated geekish excitement. We took in a few gems: The Day's Inn motel boasting a looming windmill and mock Tudor facade; Ostrich World, which gives you the bizarre opportunity of feeding hungry flocks; and a vineyard which features in one memorable scene. I am far from an oracle on wine, but it's not hard to enjoy the distinctly civilized process of tasting. Visitors to Kalyra Winery gather at a bar featured in the movie and pay $10 to taste eight wines. They can be a mix of red and white and each measure gives the drinker several sips. At the vineyard, we sampled Grenache, Pinot and a blend of Shiraz, Merlot and Cab Franc. Tastings are also an inducement to buy bottles, which start at around $15 and provide estates with their main source of profit. Our final destination was on a grander scale altogether: the Napa and Sonoma valleys north of San Francisco. Here, you get the idea of a real industry geared around global exports as much as local sales. There are some 400 wineries in the region, so the visitor can feel overwhelmed on first arrival. We opted to plan our itinerary on the discerning basis of which vineyards offered two-for-one tasting deals. Most tourists are not averse to sampling wine in the morning, and our first stop took us to Buena Vista, which claims to be the oldest winery in the region. Revealingly, it has been recently taken over by a French brand. The scenery around the valleys is reliably lovely year-round. In fall, the countryside turns a languid golden color, with neatly ordered rows of vineyards set off by the surrounding hills. Driving slowly in the late autumn sun was almost a religious obligation, despite the ensuing tailbacks. On my return flight, I resolved to plan a series of similar midlife crises for years to come.","Two Englishmen in their thirties hit the road in a Mustang convertible .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will sign sweeping health care reform legislation into law at the White House on Tuesday, according to two Democratic officials familiar with the planning. Obama also will hit the road to sell the measure to a still-skeptical public, giving a speech Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama launched his grass-roots drive for health care reform in Iowa City in May 2007, according to Gibbs. The bill, which constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades, passed the House of Representatives late Sunday night with no Republican support. It was approved by the Senate in December. A separate compromise package of changes also passed the House on Sunday and still needs to be approved by the Senate. The officials noted that the Senate cannot begin debate on the package before Obama signs the underlying bill into law. Passage of the bill was a huge boost for Obama, who made health care reform a domestic priority. Aides said Monday that Obama exchanged handshakes, hugs and ""high-fives"" with staffers when the outcome of the House vote became apparent. ""I haven't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since I've known him,"" said senior adviser David Axelrod, adding that Obama's jubilation Sunday night exceeded his election victory in November 2008. ""He was excited that night, but not like last night."" Republicans promised to continue fighting the reforms, with 11 state attorneys general -- all Republican -- planning lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the bill's mandate for people to buy health insurance and requirements for states to comply with its provisions. Senior Republicans in Congress warned that voters will judge Democrats harshly in November's midterm elections, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona saying the Democratic-passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year. ""There will be no cooperation for the rest of this year,"" McCain said in an interview with KFYI radio in Arizona. ""They have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it."" Highlights of what's in the bill . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, however, said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill, and he challenged McCain and other Republicans to campaign for the November election against benefits of the health care bill such as tax credits for small businesses and an end to insurance company practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. The overall $940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional Americans. Most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. Larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties. Lifetime coverage limits will be banned, and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. The compromise package would add to the bill's total cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families. The measure would scale back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. House Democrats are expected to celebrate passage of the bill at a news conference with reform advocates Tuesday afternoon. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who spearheaded her husband's failed health reform effort in the 1990s, said earlier in the day that Obama's success was an example of the president's tenacity. ""If you ever doubt the resolve of President Obama to stay with a job, look at what we got done for the United States last night when it came to passing quality affordable health care for everyone,"" Clinton said during a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Was it all worth it for Obama? Observers warn, however, that the road ahead for health care reform in the Senate may be rocky. Democratic leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the compromise plan to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. But according to Senate rules, members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges. In one of the first of many attempts Republicans say they will make to try to amend or kill the package, GOP aides went to Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin on Monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects Social Security. For that reason, GOP aides said they argued, the bill should not even be allowed to be debated. However, Frumin, according to a senior Republican and a Democratic aide, informed both parties he disagreed with the GOP assessment, and would not block the bill from reaching the Senate floor. ""There's hope that [the vote] would be done within a short period of time, like a week or so,"" said Tim McBride, a health economist and associate dean of public health at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. ""But the Senate is complicated and doesn't have the discipline that the House does."" Once the package hits the Senate floor, the chamber's rules stipulate that there must be 20 hours of debate. But that 20 hours may prove to be more of a suggestion than an indicator of what will happen, according to Cheryl Block, a law professor at Washington University's School of Law. ""It could get all messy and could go on forever if [Republicans] threw up amendment after amendment,"" Block said. ""Theoretically, it should only take 20 hours, but it will likely take longer because Republicans have things up their sleeve."" If any provision in the package of changes is rejected or changed, the entire package would then have to go back to the House for another vote. iReport: Share your views on health care reform . House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, presented a letter to House Democrats on Saturday stating that their Senate counterparts ""believe that health insurance reform cannot wait and must not be obstructed."" So far, two of the 59 senators in the Democratic caucus, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, have said they will oppose the compromise package. CNN's Ed Henry, Ed Hornick, Josh Levs, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Obama to travel to Iowa to continue sales pitch to still-skeptical public .

"(CNN) -- Officials with the Iowa Lottery are seeking the winner of a $10.75 million Hot Lotto jackpot who has until 4 p.m. Thursday to claim it. ""Someone legitimately won this money and we want them to take it home,"" lottery CEO Terry Rich said in a news release. ""But you must present the winning ticket to the lottery in order to claim the prize."" The ticket, which was bought December 29, 2010, at a QuikTrip in Des Moines, must be redeemed by 4 p.m. Thursday. The ticket matched all six numbers: 3-12-16-26-33 and Hot Ball 11. Few financial advisers would consider the $1 spent on the ticket to have been a wise investment. The buyer overcame 1 in 10.9 million odds to win, said Mary Neubauer, a spokeswoman for the state lottery. If the ticket is redeemed, the winner would owe 25% in federal taxes and 5% in state taxes, she said. But the possibility of taxes and the absence of a ticket haven't deterred the hopeful from lining up -- just in case. ""We've been getting calls from the public all day long today,"" Neubauer said Wednesday night. ""The closer that the deadline gets, the more people seem to be calling."" Huge-money ticket in Georgia goes unclaimed . Some of the calls are from people who say they may have lost the ticket, or put it through a washing machine, she said. They are walked through a series of questions to determine whether they may indeed be the winner. So far, no luck. Other calls, she said, are from people who believe in the power of their own creativity. Once told they could not have been the winner, they call back again -- and again, each time with a different story, she said. ""That's why we keep emphasizing that it comes down to -- you have to have the winning ticket,"" she said. If the prize goes unclaimed, the money would return to the 15 lotteries that offer the game -- in proportion to the percentage of sales that came from each state. ""Iowa would get back about $1.3 million if this prize were to go unclaimed,"" Rich said. States differ on how they would use the money. In Iowa, the money would go into the prize pools for future games. Though a $77 million jackpot went unclaimed this week in Georgia, such cases are exceedingly rare, said Neubauer.","$10.75 million jackpot is set to expire at 4 p.m. Thursday if no one claims it .

"(CNN) -- A rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others -- including at least 80 children -- in a previously unreported rampage late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) carried out the brutal campaign in northeastern Congo over four days in December, the report said. LRA forces attacked at least 10 villages from December 14 to 17, killing and abducting hundreds of civilians -- including women and children, according to Human Rights Watch. LRA combatants tied up villagers in the nation's remote Makombo area and hacked them to death with machetes or crushed their skulls with axes and heavy wooden sticks, the report said. Most of those killed were adult men, but at least 13 women and 23 children were among the dead -- including a 3-year-old girl who was burned to death, according to Human Rights Watch. The LRA also killed those they abducted who walked too slowly or tried to escape, Human Rights Watch said. According to those who managed to escape, children captured by the LRA were forced to kill other children who had disobeyed the LRA's rules, the report said. In numerous cases, children were ordered to surround the victim in a circle and take turns beating the child on the head with a large wooden stick until the child died, the report said. ""The Makombo massacre is one of the worst ever committed by the LRA in its bloody 23-year history, yet it has gone unreported for months,"" said Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The four-day rampage demonstrates that the LRA remains a serious threat to civilians and is not a spent force, as the Ugandan and Congolese governments claim."" CNN could not independently confirm the massacre. Human Rights Watch said that the roughly 1,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops in LRA-affected parts of northeastern Congo are insufficient to protect civilians. The peacekeeping force is considering removing some troops from the area under pressure from the Congolese government, a move Human Rights Watch warned against on Saturday. The U.N. Security Council is planning to visit Congo in mid-April to discuss the peacekeeping force's plans for withdrawal and the protection of civilians, Human Rights Watch said. The Congolese government denies that the LRA is still a serious threat in the country, which may have contributed to the absence of reports about the December massacre, Human Rights Watch said. ""We have been forgotten,"" an 80-year-old Congolese man whose son was killed during the massacre told Human Rights Watch. ""It's as if we don't exist."" ""The government says the LRA are no longer a problem, but I know that's not true,"" he said. ""I beg of you, please talk to others about what has happened to us."" The LRA is led by self-declared mystic and prophet Joseph Kony, who claims his insurgency -- which began in 1986 -- is aimed at replacing Uganda's government, led by President Yoweri Museveni, with a democracy based on the Bible's Ten Commandments. After being pushed out of Uganda in 2005, the LRA now operates in the remote border area between southern Sudan, Congo, and Central African Republic. In 2005, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for senior LRA leaders for crimes they committed in northern Uganda, but those indicted remain at large. The two commanders who perpetrated the December massacre report to one of those indicted leaders, according to Human Rights Watch. The Makombo massacre is the deadliest documented attack by the LRA since killing sprees around Christmas 2008 left scores of Congolese dead, but dozens of other attacks against civilians have been carried out in other areas in recent months, Human Rights Watch said.","A rebel group in Congo killed at least 321 civilians, Human Rights Watch said .

"(CNN) -- Archaeologists believe a desert site in Jordan may contain the ruins of the elusive King Solomon's Mines. Researchers using carbon dating techniques at Khirbat en-Nahas in southern Jordan discovered that copper production took place there around the time King Solomon is said to have ruled the Israelites. The research findings were reported in this week's issue of the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which came out Monday. King Solomon is known in the Old Testament for his wisdom and wealth and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem. The fabled mines entered popular culture in 1885 with the publication in Great Britain of the bestselling ""King Solomon's Mines"" by Sir H. Rider Haggard. In the book, adventurers in search of the mines find gold, diamonds and ivory. Since then, the mines have been the the subject of several films. Yet their possible location -- and whether they exist at all -- remains cloaked in mystery. Thomas Levy of the University of California San Diego, who led the research, said carbon dating placed copper production at Khirbat en-Nahas (Arabic for 'Ruins of copper"") in the 10th century -- in line with the biblical narrative of Solomon's rule. ""We can't believe everything ancient writings tell us,"" Levy said in a university statement. ""But this research represents a confluence between the archaeological and scientific data and the Bible."" Khirbat en-Nahas is an arid region south of the Dead Sea, in Jordan's Faynan district. The Old Testament identifies the area with the Kingdom of Edom. As early as the 1930s, archaeologists linked the site to the Edomite kingdom, but some of those claims were dismissed in subsequent years. ""Now ... we have evidence that complex societies were indeed active in 10th and 9th centuries BCE and that brings us back to the debate about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible narratives related to this period,"" Levy said.","Desert site in Jordan may contain the ruins of the fabled King Solomon's mines .

"(CNN) -- At least 50 officers and civilians were feared dead after Bangladeshi paramilitary troops staged a mutiny, taking dozens of high-ranking officers and military brass hostage, the country's law minister said Thursday. Bangladeshi soldiers take position armed with automatic weapons in Dhaka on Wednesday. As dawn broke, the rebelling troops with the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) allowed government officials entry into the headquarters in the capital city of Dhaka -- the scene of a day-long standoff Wednesday. The troops agreed to lay down their arms after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina agreed to offer them amnesty. Ministers went door to door within the compound's officers' quarters to assure frightened women and children it was safe to come out. ""Nearly 50 people have been killed in sporadic fighting in the headquarters of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR),"" Mohammad Quamrul Islam, state minister for law and parliamentary affairs told reporters. In addition to military officials and BDR brass, the dead and wounded included passersby, including a rickshaw puller, struck by stray bullets during the gun battle, the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said. CNN was not immediately able to confirm the exact casualty count, with medical officials saying a final number will come after they had a chance to comb through the premises looking for bodies. At around 4:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. GMT) Thursday, Bangladeshi TV channels broadcast video of Home Minister Sahara Kahtun telling rebelling paramilitary officers in the room that she could assure them the government would listen to their grievances. As she spoke, officers deposited weapons and ammunition onto a table in front of her and into piles on the floor. The video was initially broadcast on state run TV station BTV. Various private networks picked it up soon after. The Rifles is a paramilitary force responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, more than 65,000-strong, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week when officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. At least 5,000 -- maybe more -- BDR personnel were inside the compound in the Pilkhana area of the capital when the mutiny occurred about 7:45 a.m. local time Wednesday, said Mohammed Sajjad Haider, spokesman for the information ministry. Their mobile phones were turned off, making it difficult for the government to get a handle on the situation, he said. The rebelling troops were low-ranking members of the BDR, akin to infantrymen, who were angry at the way they were treated by their superiors, Haider said. ""They have several demands,"" Haider said. ""They want pay parity with the army, they want job security, they want better food rations."" The mutiny is the most serious crisis for Bangladesh's newly elected government, which came into power in December after two years of army-backed rule. Throughout the day and into the night, curious onlookers gathered outside the compound -- only to scramble for cover as sounds of gunfire periodically pierced the air. Plumes of black smoke coming from inside the compound could be seen for miles throughout the capital. Occasionally, the rebelling troops -- red bandannas covering their faces and guns slung over their shoulders -- walked past the closed gates of the compound, chanting, ""We have been deprived for a long time, we have deep grievances."" ""I've been hearing gunfire all morning,"" said Zunaid Kazi, a San Diego, California, resident who is staying at a house a few blocks from the headquarters.  Watch as Kazi describes what he saw and heard » . ""There will be a little lull and then the sustained gunfire will pick up again,"" he said. ""I can hear military helicopters in the sky.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN)Shortages of basic products such as corn, milk and chicken have plagued Venezuela for years, creating long lines at supermarkets and pushing inflation well past the 60% mark just in the last year alone. More recently, shortages are affecting people in the South American country in a more personal way.  Venezuelan consumers complain condoms and birth control pills are nowhere to be found.  Shortages that first affected the dining table have now made their way into the bedroom. CNN visited eight pharmacies in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.  Four had no condoms at all and the other four had limited availability.  A couple only carried only one domestic brand. Yuraima Bacher, a pharmacy manager, said her establishment doesn't get supplies with the frequency they once did. ""Can you believe it?  It's been two weeks [since the last shipment].  Things have been slow since early January, and it's been the same thing so far this month,"" Bacher said. Venezuelans are turning to Mercado Libre, or Free Market. It's a website similar to eBay where consumers buy and sell all kinds of products. One subscriber is selling a box of 36 condoms for 4,760 bolivars.   That's a whopping $755 U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate.  It's also 85% of the Venezuelan monthly minimum salary, currently at 5,602 bolivars. President Nicolas Maduro announced in June his government was building a condom factory to supply the domestic market.  The factory was built, but pharmacy managers say quality has not been what their customers demand.  Production levels are not meeting domestic demand either. Magdymar Leon, a coordinator at the Venezuelan Association for an Alternative Sexual Education, says public health experts worry the scarcity of contraception methods might have long-term consequences. ""What are the implications? One is that the individual doesn't have the means to control a decision to have children or not.  That right is lost.  On the other hand, the ability to protect oneself from sexually transmitted diseases is also lost,"" Leon said. A 2012 World Bank study shows Venezuela has the fifth-highest teen pregnancy rate out of 21 Latin American countries. The HIV infection rate, at 0.6% of the general population, is also a serious concern for public health analysts, a risk than can only increase unless Venezuelan authorities take measures to address shortages of contraception methods.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan officially declared Saturday that he will run in the 2011 elections, lauding his achievements in reforming the oil, banking and electricity sectors. ""I have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the presidential primaries of our party the great PDP (People's Democratic Party),"" he said. Jonathan's official declaration comes three days after he informally announced on Facebook that he intended to run in the primaries, which will be held between October 18 and 20, according PDP spokesman Rufai Alkali. ""In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian,"" Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday. He took a more confident stance Saturday, announcing that under his presidency, all petrol refineries are now working, the banking sector has been reformed, electricity has been stablized and steps have been taken to fix roads, water, education and food production. He also said he has set in progress free and fair elections. Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the People's Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north. Yar'Adua's death in May, after a long illness, upset the order of the zoning. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power. On Friday, four main contenders from the north announced they will put forth a single candidate to challenge Jonathan. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","President Goodluck Jonathan will run in next month's primaries .

Then he decided to leave his practice and work for Michael Jackson, getting paid $150,000 a month. Dr. Conrad Murray was with Michael Jackson on the day that he died. Before working with the King of Pop, Murray spent most of his time operating clinics in both Nevada and Texas after graduating from Meharry Medical College, a historically black school in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1989. He spent his internship and residency years in California. At the clinics in Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada, his patients had been surprised to learn that he would be leaving his private practice to work with Jackson.  Watch profile of Dr. Conrad Murray » . Many told news outlets they support their former physician as he faces scrutiny by authorities investigating Jackson's death. ""I don't care what nobody says. He's a damn good doctor,"" Mary Webb, a former patient, told CNN affiliate KTNV-TV. But he was a doctor with financial woes that became evident not long after he graduated from medical school. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 1992 and accumulated $44,663 in state tax liens in Arizona and California from 1993 until 2003, according to court documents. The doctor, who was with Jackson on the day he died, has offices in Houston and Las Vegas and specializes in cardiology and internal medicine, according to state medical boards. Murray's financial troubles continued after opening the clinics -- though outsiders may not have known it, based on his million-dollar home in a gated community next to the Red Rock Country Club in Las Vegas. Murray has been hit with several judgments related to unpaid bills, child support payments, defaults on educational loans and payment for equipment said to have been rented to him. In a statement on his Web site, Murray's attorney said that the doctor continues to travel to see his patients in Houston. The cost of maintaining those relationships exceeds any payment or income he receives for his work, attorney Ed Chernoff said in the statement. Murray saw his patients in addition to his new role as Jackson's doctor. He was hired by promoter AEG to work with Jackson for this summer's ""This Is It"" tour, after the 50-year-old singer requested Murray be around to care for him during the grueling rehearsal and mammoth 50-show tour. The pair met in Las Vegas in 2006, when Murray treated one of Jackson's children at the recommendation of one of Jackson's bodyguards. Murray's attorney says the relationship went beyond just a doctor and a patient. ""Dr. Murray was not a doctor first,"" Chernoff told CNN four days after the entertainer's death. ""He was a friend first. They were close personal friends. Michael Jackson really treated him as family.""  Watch discussion of doctor's relationship with Jackson » . But now, some Jackson family members have accused the doctor of wrongdoing. He has also been the target of three searches by police . Murray's office in Houston was searched last week, and on Tuesday, authorities searched his Las Vegas home and office. No charges have been filed against Murray. The searches came a day after a source confirmed to CNN that Murray administered a powerful drug that authorities believe killed the singer. The drug, known as Diprivan or propofol, is an anesthetic that is normally administered in a hospital setting. But Murray also has no hospital privileges in California, so he could not have treated Jackson in a hospital setting, even on the day he died. Murray hasn't spoken publicly since Jackson's death. Chernoff, his lawyer, told CNN that Murray did not ""prescribe or administer anything that should have killed Michael Jackson."" He also said Murray did not prescribe any powerful painkillers to the star. John Thomas, Murray's friend, said he spoke to the doctor three days before Jackson died to invite him to an event in Las Vegas. Thomas, a regional sales manager for Pit Bull energy products, met Murray when the doctor invested with a distributor to try to bring Pit Bull to his native Trinidad, Thomas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. ""He couldn't have been happier then,"" Thomas told the newspaper, reflecting on their last conversation. ""He was apologetic about not being able to come to the opening, but he said he was busy with Michael."" In their last phone call, Thomas told the newspaper, Murray seemed upbeat and said and he ""liked being in the limelight, meeting all the celebrities."" Thomas added that it was also clear in their last conversation that the celebrity salary he was receiving was aiding Murray with ""some of the financial troubles he talked about."" Although Murray remains the target of authorities' scrutiny, those who knew him before Jackson's death struggled to comprehend what could have happened. Webb, one of Murray's Las Vegas patients, said he helped save her life. Webb told CNN affiliate KTNV-TV that she has coronary artery disease and went to Murray, who put in five stents. Through all the pain, Webb insists, Murray would tell her to take only ibuprofen or Tylenol. ""One time I told him, 'If you don't give me something for this pain, I'm checking out,' "" she told KTNV. ""[But] because he did not believe in giving drugs, he did not."" One of Murray's former patients in Houston also praised the doctor, saying he helped save her life when he discovered blockages in her heart. ""If I had to rate Dr. Conrad Murray from 1 to 100,"" Ruby Mosley told CNN affiliate KHOU-TV, ""I'd give him every bit of 100."" Mosley said that without the discovery, she might have had a heart attack, a stroke or an aneurysm. ""He found them,"" she said. ""I credit him and God."" Webb told KTNV that her faith in her doctor remains strong despite the allegations lodged against him. ""If there was any way in Dr. Murray's power to save Michael, he would've,"" she said.","$435,000 in judgments, liens against Dr. Conrad Murray .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Weeks after getting asylum in Russia, Edward Snowden now has a job there, one of his lawyers says. Snowden, the U.S. national security contractor turned leaker, will start a job Friday with a major Russian website, his attorney Anatoly Kucherena told CNN Thursday. Kucherena declined to name the employer for security reasons. He told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that Snowden would perform maintenance for the site. Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims . Snowden, a 30-year-old former government information technology contractor, collected information on spy programs -- in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the programs to the media. Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Hong Kong in late May and flew on June 23 to Moscow, where he holed up at the airport for more than five weeks. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. After Russia granted him an asylum term of one year on August 1, he left the airport. As Snowden got ready to start his new job, he was also meeting Thursday with a German lawmaker who visited him in Russia. Hans-Christian Stroebele, a well-known leftist legislator in Germany, met with Snowden in Moscow to invite him to testify before the German parliament. According to Stroebele's website, during their meeting, Snowden gave him a letter addressed to the German parliament and to the country's attorney general. Stroebele, a member of the Green party, tweeted a picture of himself with Snowden and said he would hold a news conference Friday to provide details about the letter's contents. The meeting comes amid outrage among many German leaders over claims that an NSA surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine first reported the alleged operation, citing documents leaked by Snowden. Stroebele sits on a parliamentary committee that monitors intelligence agencies.

"(CNN)Even though Rafael Nadal had beaten his first-round opponent at the Australian Open, Mikhail Youzhny, five straight times, the Spaniard wasn't sure what to expect when they played Monday. After all Nadal last competed at a major at Wimbledon and had lost both singles matches that he contested this year as he returned from appendix surgery. Nadal -- who also suffered from back and wrist injuries in 2014 -- cast doubt on his Australian Open participation just last week. Youzhny, too, owned four victories over the 14-time grand slam champion. But in a score that is sure to have his rivals taking note, the Spaniard crushed the former top-10 regular 6-3 6-2 6-2. ""Very positive result for me,"" Nadal told reporters. ""I think very good start. ""Always before the first match you have the doubts, especially in this situation I'm arriving here. Never easy, but it was an important match for me. Was a comfortable victory that give me some confidence."" Nadal habitually lingers on court even when he wins in straight sets but he needed just one hour, 50 minutes to dispose of the veteran Russian. He only faced one break point, dropped four points behind his first serve and struck 22 more winners than unforced errors. ""I think I returned well,"" said the 2014 finalist. ""My return worked really well. The serve, too. I served, I think, the right way, with only one break point during the whole match. And in general I played with not many mistakes."" Nadal could face Roger Federer in the semifinals, and the Swiss began his charge with a 6-4 6-2 7-5 win over Yen-Hsun Lu. Lu has upset the likes of Andy Murray, Andy Roddick and David Nalbandian in the past but he only really challenged the 17-time grand slam winner in the third set. An attacking Federer -- appearing in a record extending 61st straight major -- approached the net more than 40 times, winning 70% of those points. Nadal and Federer were joined in the second round by two-time grand slam winner Murray, although an outside contender for the women's draw, Ana Ivanovic, fell. There was a time when many thought the former No. 1 would never return to the top 10 and top five but 2013 and 2014 saw the Serb re-climb the rankings. And last week, she extended Maria Sharapova to three sets in a final in Brisbane. Her goal in 2015, she said, was to perform her best at the grand slams, yet Monday's 1-6 6-3 6-2 loss to Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka means she still hasn't figured things out. Ivanovic heavily contributed to her downfall, hitting 10 double faults. It's now only one grand slam quarterfinal for Ivanovic in her past nine attempts. ""It's really disappointing,"" Ivanovic told reporters. ""It's probably the worst thing that could happen. ""I really have to now sit and work on few things and just maybe try to have a different approach to this kind of event and try to see what was lacking."" Ivanovic admitted to nerves prior to the encounter, as did third-seed Simona Halep ahead of her match against Karin Knapp. But the fast-rising Halep overcame the nerves and eased past the Italian 6-3 6-2. Sharapova, bidding for a first major outside the French Open in seven years, defeated Petra Martic 6-4 6-1. Halep's reward is a second-round clash with Aussie Jarmila Gajdosova, who snapped a long drought at her home major. Having lost all nine of her previous matches in Melbourne, the big-serving Gajdosova ousted Halep's fellow Romanian Alexandra Dulgheru 6-3 6-4. ""I was talking to my coach and I told him I actually did feel like I won the Australian Open,"" Gajdosova said. ""It was just the first round but it's been such a long time coming. Not to be able to do it in your home Grand Slam was very devastating for me."" Later, there was more joy for Australia as two of its brightest prospects won five setters. First Thanasi Kokkinakis upset 11th seed Ernests Gulbis 5-7 6-0 1-6 7-6 (2) 8-6. Kokkinakis -- who saved four match points in the fourth -- celebrated by doing a victory lap. Not long after and past midnight in Melbourne, Nick Kyrgios -- Nadal's conqueror at Wimbledon -- edged Federico Delbonis 7-6 (2) 3-6 6-3 6-7 (5) 6-3.","Rafael Nadal crushes Mikhail Youzhny at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- You could likely count on one hand the number of writers who could scare the daylights out of you as effectively as they could cheer you up. And there aren't too many fingers on that hand representing those writers who could do both in the same story or even on the same page and convince you that they know what they're doing. Overheard on CNN.com: Ray Bradbury was 'very down to Earth,' or maybe Mars . Ray Bradbury, who died early Wednesday at age 91, knew what he was doing when he threw you into a dark place leaking menace and dread at every corner and when he lifted you into an enchanted realm bursting with magical properties. Favorite quotes from Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451' At times, these places -- light or dark, weedy or glistening -- were part of a distant past closely resembling Bradbury's Waukegan, Illinois, childhood of blessed summer evenings and portentous autumn twilights -- evoked most memorably in his 1957 autobiographical novel, ""Dandelion Wine."" At others, they were places conceived in a hypothetical future that often looked like a hyped-up version of the present day -- or at least whatever ""present day"" Bradbury happened to be writing. Top five Bradbury films . Think, for instance, of ""The Martian Chronicles,"" a collection of short stories regarded as Bradbury's breakthrough when it was published in 1950, even though he'd been writing and publishing fantasy, horror and science fiction for at least a decade before. Bradbury imagined a red planet whose colonization by Earthlings brings upon its dry terrain both the sweetly nostalgic graces of early to mid-20th-century Americana and some of the harsher aspects of human nature -- disease, war, bigotry and so on -- over time wreaking irrevocable havoc upon the native Martians and their civilization. News: Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury dies . Bradbury was hardly the first to use the medium of science fiction -- or as its more serious followers prefer, ""speculative fiction"" -- to engage social issues. But his success in bringing his futuristic Gothic tales to such publications as Esquire, the Saturday Evening Post and Mademoiselle broadened the audience for science fiction and elevated the genre's standing in the literary mainstream. My last conversation with Ray Bradbury . Wherever he was published, whatever he wrote about, Bradbury spoke to his readers in a style described by critic Gilbert Highet in his introduction to the 1965 collection, ""The Vintage Bradbury"" as ""a curious mixture of poetry and colloquialism ... so brisk and economical that it never becomes cloying, so full of unexpected quirks that it is never boring."" Interview: Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels' Some disagreed. Even Highet conceded in the same paragraph that he ""occasionally"" found Bradbury's writing ""a little too intense and breathless."" Still others griped that they found Bradbury's blend of robust affirmation and astringent gloom too glib and calculated to please as wide an audience of soreheads and romantics as possible. But Bradbury's more intelligent and incisive readers found greater resonance in his writing than his deceptively simple approach evoked on the surface. Rainn Wilson, others tweet tributes to Bradbury . One such fan was the Argentine fabulist and poet Jorge Luis-Borges, who in his introduction to his Spanish-language translation of ""The Martian Chronicles, asked: ""What has this man from Illinois done, I ask myself when I close the pages of his book, that episodes from the conquest of another planet fill me with horror and loneliness?"" And there was nothing calculated or contrived about Bradbury's blend of optimism and pessimism. The man who once wrote a guide entitled ""Zen in the Art of Writing"" (1994) embraced all his contradictions -- light and dark, elegist and gadfly, dreamer and skeptic -- as one with a universe whose perils and possibilities he greeted with the same open-hearted wonder. ""I prefer to see myself,"" he told an interviewer for the Paris Review in 2010, ""as the Janus, the two-faced god who is half Pollyanna and half Cassandra, warning of the future and perhaps living too much in the past -- a combination of both. ""But,"" he added, ""I don't think I'm too overoptimistic."" What did Bradbury mean to you? Share with us on CNN iReport!

"DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Delaware (CNN) -- His name was Phillip A. Myers. A staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, he was killed in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan on Saturday. The body of Phillip Myers, 30, arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Sunday. The return of his body to the United States aboard a charter aircraft Sunday marked a solemn moment that has been repeated more than 5,000 times at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware since the start of the war in Afghanistan in late 2001. Much of this night was like so many of the others: The well-practiced and crisp movement of the carry team silently transferring the body from the plane to the truck that would transport it to the base mortuary and the presence of Myers' family, quietly watching every step and order, ensured dignity and respect for the fallen in an atmosphere that does not lend itself to peace and quiet. This night, however, was not like the other nights. Watching all of this were about 40 journalists allowed to cover the return of Myers' remains. It was the first time in almost 20 years the return of a fallen U.S. service member was able to be recorded by the media. Myers' widow was the first to be asked by the military, under a new policy by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, if she wished to have news media at Dover Air Force Base for her husband's final return home. Her decision to do so was historical and allowed the public to see a side of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the country has not yet seen. The only noise on the flight line was the perpetual whine of the Atlas Air 747's power generator. This was the plane that had brought Myers and another fallen soldier back to the United States. The media were not allowed to cover the other soldier's transfer and were not given his name or the circumstances of his death, because the family had not granted permission. On the flight line, journalists were asked not to speak, use camera flashes or make undue movement while watching the transfer. With cameras rolling, an eight-member carry team wearing battle-dress uniforms and white gloves stood by the flag-draped transfer case carrying Myers, as the chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, said a prayer.  Watch the coverage of the return of the fallen service member » . The team slowly moved the transfer case from the aircraft onto the loader. With a jolt, the quiet of the night was shattered as a diesel engine was started to lower the loader toward the ground and then was shut off. Bathed in light from the giant floodlights along the flight line, the team hoisted the transfer case and carried it to a waiting panel truck. As the transfer case was secured, the carry team saluted, the doors of the truck were slowly closed and then driven under police escort to the base mortuary. Seven family members watched the truck until it was out of sight, one man among them crying into a tissue. Myers was from Hopewell, Virginia, and died Saturday of wounds suffered in a roadside bombing, the Air Force said. He was assigned to the 48th Civil Engineer Squadron, with the Royal Air Force Lakenheath, UK, and in March 2008 received the Bronze Star for valor. He was 30 years old. Casualties: Afghanistan | Iraq . The ban on media coverage of returning war dead was implemented by President George Bush in 1991 and the policy has been the subject of much debate since. Some called it censorship; others said it allowed privacy and respect for the families during a very difficult time.  Watch an Army widow call the policy is 'dignified' » . An exception on the ban by President Bill Clinton in 2000 allowed coverage of the return of sailors killed in the attack on the USS Cole. Shortly after taking office, President Obama asked Gates to take a look at the policy. In February, Gates reversed it, but with conditions. Family members would be asked if they wanted news media to cover the transfer of their loved one's body. iReport.com: What do you think about this decision? Service members' support groups had mixed opinions on the change. Some welcomed the change to show the human cost of war, and others opposed it. ""We are committed to seeing that America's fallen heroes are received back to their loved ones and their country with the honor, respect and recognition that they and their families have earned,"" Gates said after his decision. ""The overriding principle is that decisions about media coverage should be made by those most affected: the families,"" he said.","Media on hand for first time in almost 20 years as fallen service member returns .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Cuba Wednesday and called on developing countries to unite against ""imperialism and capitalism."" ""Why are the Iranian, Cuban and Latin American people punished by the United States?"" he asked the audience attending his speech at the University of Havana. ""Have we attacked them in some way? Have we asked for more than we are owed? Never, not once. We have only ever wanted justice."" Ahmadinejad did not directly mention a bomb attack that left an Iranian nuclear scientist dead in Tehran Wednesday. But, he said, ""The capitalist system might do damage, sabotage."" Facing increasing sanctions over Iran's alleged development of nuclear weapons, Ahmadinejad is calling on friendly heads of state this week in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. He was expected to meet with high-ranking government officials on the island, including President Raul Castro. By Wednesday evening, the Cuban government had not made any announcement about whether Ahmadinejad had met with former President Fidel Castro. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, a Cuban-American who has called for tougher sanctions against the island nation's government, called Ahmadinejad's itinerary a ""tour of tyrants.""

"(CNN) -- At 44-years-old Abhisit Vejjajiva is Thailand's youngest prime minister in more than 60 years. But perhaps more immediately significantly, he is the country's third prime minister in four months after a period of immense upheaval in Thailand. After just two days of taking office, Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva talked to CNN's Dan Rivers for Talk Asia. Thailand's recent political turmoil, which included national demonstrations and the forced closures of international airports, dates back to the 2006 coup that overthrew former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the former People's Power Party leader. In September, the Constitutional Court forced out his replacement Samak Sundaravej, finding that he had violated the constitution by appearing as a paid guest on a television cooking show. In turn he was replaced by Thaksin's brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat, who immediately found himself beset by opposition demonstrations that accused him of leading a proxy government for Thaksin. He too was thrown out by a Constitutional Court ruling. Abhisit was named as the new Prime Minister on December 15, and his biggest challenge will be to steady a country that until recently was known as one of the most region's most stable. A career politician, Abhisit was born in Newcastle in the north east of England to wealthy Thai-Chinese parents and attended Eton, one of the UK's top private schools before studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University. While highly critical of the corruption and cronyism in Thai politics, Abhisit's own route to power has not been as he may have wanted it. As leader of the Democrat Party since 2005, he failed to win either of the elections he contended. He was chosen by the Thai parliament to be Prime Minister during a special session. His selection was contingent on support of factions from the now banned PPP who changed allegiance, many of whom he had previously criticized. Abhisit now leads a coalition government with a small majority consisting of a number of parties and interests, leading political commentators to speculate about the length of his tenure in office, many suggesting more than a year in power would be a success. Countering accusations of inexperience, Abhisit can still boast 17 years of political practice, having become a parliamentarian at the age of 27. As well as being young and cosmopolitan, he has gained a reputation as being above the sleaze and corruption that has dogged many other Thai politicians, while he publicly opposed the bloodless military coup that removed Thaksin from office 2006. However critics have said that his policies are borrowed heavily from Thaksin and that his party's decision to boycott the snap election in 2006 led to the constitutional crisis and coup against Thaksin. Most of Abhisit's support comes from the educated middle classes and gaining support, or at least lessening the divisions between sections of Thai society is something he has been immediately faced with. ""He needs to send a clear signal of change that he is a leader who will reach out to all,"" said Bunranaj Smutharak, a spokesman for Abhisit's Democrat Party. ""We are confident the long turmoil over the past two years will be brought to an end by this change in government,"" he said. ""What we set out to do is reunite the country.""","Abhisit is Thailand's third Prime Minister in four months, youngest in 60 years .

"(CNN) -- A total of 20 pilot whales have been found dead on an island off southwestern Florida, possibly driven ashore by high seas, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday. A boater reported the whales early Thursday afternoon near Kice Island, south of Naples, said Blair Mase, NOAA's Southeastern stranding coordinator. Their bodies were found above the normal tide line, suggesting that seas whipped by strong westerly winds may have led to their running aground, Mase said. It's the second time this week that pods of pilot whales, which can reach sizes up to 25 feet, have found themselves in danger off the state's southwest coast. Of the 14 whales that were found off a state park near Fort Myers on Monday, eight died, including one pregnant female, NOAA said. Necropsies on those animals have produced no significant findings that would point to a cause of death, Mase said. Some of the whales appeared emaciated, but others appeared to be in good shape, she said. And in December, 51 pilot whales were stranded on the edge of Everglades National Park; only 29 survived. About 2,400 pilot whales are believed to live in the Gulf of Mexico, according to NOAA.

"(CNN) -- A year ago on Thursday, the U.S. Senate failed to pass a bill that would have helped fix our nation's gun laws by requiring background checks on all purchases of firearms. Ninety percent of all Americans -- and more than 80% of gun owners -- believe that all people should be subject to such checks. And even though the bill won majority support in the Senate -- more than 50 members -- it was not enough to break a filibuster. But in the year after the massacre at Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012, the grassroots movement to pass common sense gun laws and policies that are consistent with the Second Amendment has made great progress just about everywhere except Washington. In Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware and New York, local citizens helped lead the successful push for legislation that closed loopholes in background checks laws. In Washington state and Wisconsin, citizens helped pass laws that keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. In Colorado alone, the new law stopped more than 160 prohibited buyers from getting their hands on a gun, and as Coloradans know too well, it only takes one to devastate a family, a community, a nation. And the law hasn't gotten in the way of law-abiding gun owners, who bought more firearms in 2013 than in any preceding year. We also gave voice to hundreds of thousands of Americans who persuaded Facebook and Instagram to change their policies so that unlicensed gun sellers cannot use their sites to sell guns without background checks. These significant victories were won by a growing, nonpartisan coalition that is refusing to wait for Washington to act. That coalition includes parents, mayors, police chiefs, religious leaders, gun owners and everyday Americans of all political persuasions. Mothers, in particular, have been at the forefront of this fight. They've given testimony at town halls, led ""Stroller Jams"" at state capitals, hosted quilting bees and delivered petitions to legislatures and companies across the country. To unify the efforts of this diverse coalition of Americans, we are launching Everytown for Gun Safety in America, a new umbrella organization that will be the largest and best-organized counterweight to the gun lobby that has ever been created. Everytown for Gun Safety will expand on the work of two existing organizations -- Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America -- and take the fight for gun violence prevention policies to every community in the country. Everytown for Gun Safety will continue pushing for better background check laws in Congress and state houses. But we will also broaden our focus to include other issues that are important to Americans, like safe storage education campaigns to help keep kids from being killed by unlocked or dangerously stored guns. And new laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. And efforts to help reduce the nearly 19,400 suicides that happen every year with guns. In each area, we will make progress by doing something that no gun group, other than the National Rifle Association, has ever done: inform and mobilize voters. The reason the NRA has political influence -- in addition to its campaign contributions -- is that it has scared elected officials into believing that voters will oppose them unless they follow the NRA's Washington leadership, which has grown increasingly extreme and increasingly out of touch with its own members. Bloomberg to spend $50 million to challenge NRA on guns . In fact, the NRA's reputation for political strength is wildly blown out of proportion and the election results from three statewide contests in Virginia this past November reflect that reality. Candidates who spoke out in support of common sense gun violence prevention policies were elected as governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. In the attorney general's race, his campaign manager said that the candidate's support for sensible stances on gun issues was a major factor in his victory. Nonetheless, the perception of an unbeatable gun lobby still lingers and part of our mission will be showing candidates and elected officials that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support common sense gun policies that respect the Second Amendment and save lives. To mobilize voters who are committed to backing candidates that support common sense gun policies, Everytown for Gun Safety is launching a Gun Sense Voter campaign. Before the 2014 midterms, we aim to get at least 1 million Americans to pledge to vote for state and federal candidates based on where they stand on gun safety. We'll keep voters informed by tracking candidates' positions and determining which of them support gun safety and which do not. Leaders from all walks of life will join us on our board of directors, including one of our nation's most respected military leaders, Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; University of Oklahoma president and former Sen. David Boren; and former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. All of us are united by the belief that accepting the status quo -- 12,000 Americans are murdered with guns every year -- is unconscionable. There is no doubt that we have a big hill to climb. Well-funded, entrenched special interests are always difficult to defeat. And for years, the gun lobby has largely had the field to itself. No longer. Everytown for Gun Safety and its growing grassroots network will be gunning for change that both protects our country and respects our Constitution.","Writers: 90% of Americans, 80% of gun owners want background checks for guns .

"There's always something happening in the city that never sleeps, but if you're in New York at the right time you'll get to see New Yorkers coming together for one of the city's big annual events. Giant inflatables are the highlight of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. St Patrick's Day Parade (17 March) St Patrick's Day is when New York's sizeable Irish-American community celebrates its long association with the city, with thousands joining a flag-waving parade of traditional marching pipe bands. Dating back to 1762, it's far more traditional than New York's other parades. There are no floats or corporate sponsors involved -- just vast numbers of green-clad revelers. Indeed, it's the one day of the year when shamrock-adorned hats and stick on ginger beards are considered appropriate attire. The event kicks off at 11 a.m. at 44th Street, making its way past St. Patrick's Cathedral at 50th Street and the American Irish Historical Society at 83rd, finishing at 86th Street at around 5:00 p.m. Needless to say, New York's Irish bars get pretty crowded in the evening.

But, naturally, New York is where the celebrations become a full-blown extravaganza. The highlight of New York's Independence Day celebrations is the Macy's fireworks display. Usually, fireworks are launched from the East River, but the 2009 fireworks will be launched from barges positioned between 24th and 50th Streets on the Hudson River. That means Manhattan's West Side and New Jersey will provide prime viewing spots and will consequently be packed to the gills with tens of thousands of rubbernecking New Yorkers.

Village Halloween Parade (31 October) Halloween is a big deal in America and the nation's biggest and best Halloween parade takes place along New York's Sixth Avenue. Greenwich Village's ""anything goes"" attitude is what makes this event special, translating into eye-popping costumes, heaps of audience interaction and dazzling giant puppets, brought to life by showboating puppeteers. The parade begins at 6.30 p.m., starting on Spring Street and making its way to 23rd Street. You'll need to stake your roadside spot early if you want to see more than the backs of other spectators. Better still, wear a costume and you're entitled to join in the parade -- nothing is too outrageous. Even if you're cheering from the sidelines, you should get into the spirit of things by donning a ghoulish mask at the very least, thousands of which suddenly appear in local shops in the days leading up to the parade. http://www.halloween-nyc.com . Macy's Thanksgiving Parade (fourth Thursday in November) A New York institution, the inaugural parade in 1924 included live animals on loan from from Central Park Zoo. The zoo animals have long been retired, replaced by floats that act as moving anchors for enormous helium balloons of various colorful cartoon characters. These floating colossi are the highlight of the event and attract annual crowds of around three million New Yorkers. The parade runs from 9 a.m. to midday and follows a two-and-a-half mile route through Central Park West to Herald Square.

"(CNN) -- Ty Warner, the billionaire creator of Beanie Babies plush toys, won't serve prison time for hiding millions of dollars in secret Swiss bank accounts to evade taxes. A judge sentenced Warner to two years' probation Tuesday, ordering him to perform 500 hours of community service at three Chicago high schools and pay a $100,000 fine. ""Society will be best served to allow (Warner) to continue his good works,"" U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras said at a sentencing hearing Tuesday, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago. Warner had pleaded guilty to tax evasion and already paid a $53 million civil penalty and about $27 million in back taxes, prosecutors said. When he pleaded guilty, Warner admitted that he had maintained Swiss bank accounts with an unreported gross income of more than $24 million. Warner is the owner and founder of TY Inc., which hit it big in the 1990s when Beanie Babies became some of the nation's hottest toys and collector's items. The plush animals sell for as little as $5, though rare models can fetch thousands of dollars at auction. While Beanie Babies have largely faded from the public consciousness, they've made a fortune for Warner. Forbes Magazine estimates his net worth as of September at $2.6 billion. The tax evasion charge carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

"Two car bombs killed at least 31 people, including 20 children, in central Yemen's Radaa city when suspected al Qaeda fighters targeted Houthi militants Tuesday, senior security officials and locals told CNN. One car bomb struck a Houthi gathering point, but the other did not make it to the target and instead blew up next to a bus that was carrying children home from school, officials said. All the killed children were under the age of 12, said Osama Sari, a prominent pro-Houthi activist. Eleven Houthi fighters were killed, an Interior Ministry official said. Eyewitnesses told CNN that the death toll within Houthi lines exceeded 18. At least a dozen others were injured, among them six in critical condition, medical sources in Radaa told CNN. Radaa was an al Qaeda stronghold that fell to Houthi fighters after clashes in October that killed hundreds from both sides. Al Qaeda has since intensified its attacks on Houthi targets, conducting daily attacks killing hundreds of Houthis and innocent civilians. Houthis follow the Zaidi sect of Islam and are considered Shiite Muslims by al Qaeda, a Sunni Muslim terrorist network. Sari said that most of the killed were children and that the attack holds the hallmarks of al Qaeda. ""The suicide car bombs were supposed to directly hit the Houthi camp. When they failed to reach the core target, many innocent children lost their lives,"" Sari said.","One car bomb hit Houthi militants; another exploded next to a school bus, officials say .

"(CNN) -- The budget battles continue to rage. Every time the Congress and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins. At best, the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions, temporary stopgap measures that indicate the budget process is dysfunctional. At worst, the federal government shuts down -- as it might this week -- or Congress will fail to raise the debt ceiling in a few more weeks. The impact of these fights could be horrendous for the economy. Few dispute that our budget process is broken. But the nation is so buried in the weeds, trying to scramble out of each specific budget battle, that there is hardly time to step back and understand what dynamics are driving this process. Partisan strategy is one of the main culprits. Polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill. But in recent years, Republicans in particular have taken the initiative to use the budget as a way to handcuff Democratic presidents. The strategy has deep roots. In 1966 and 1967, conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focused attention on the rising deficits to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts and bring his opportunities for enacting more legislation to an end. In 1995 and 1996, Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts. Even after the backlash helped President Bill Clinton regain his political standing, which had plummeted after the 1994 election, the GOP continued to insist on spending cuts through the remainder of Clinton's term, leaving him little opportunity to do much more than to try and curtail their demands. Since 2010, a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force President Barack Obama's hand on this issue. They have demonstrated that they would be fine with shutting down the government and they have threatened to not raise the debt ceiling -- which would send the country into default. To be sure there have been moments when Democrats have challenged Republican presidents as well. The difference is they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about Republican policies, whereas the new generation of Republicans appears willing to follow through on the threat. In a recent interview with The New York Times, New York Republican Peter King lambasted his colleagues, calling Sen. Ted Cruz's recent tactics, ""a form of governmental terrorism."" Another reason the budgeting process is becoming ever more brutal is because, historically, once legislators break the barrier of using a certain tactic, the practice can become normalized. The best example is the filibuster. There was a time when members of the Senate were reluctant to use the filibuster frequently. They reserved it for high-profile issues, like civil rights, believing that ordinarily a majority should be sufficient to pass legislation. But since the 1970s, the filibuster has become a routine weapon in partisan combat. Senators have been willing to threaten or use the filibuster more frequently, and to do so on rather mundane issues. The result has been that the Senate became a chamber where a supermajority is required on most issues. We're seeing a similar dynamic with the budget. Whereas threatening a government shutdown was once seen as a highly dramatic act, in the current environment there are many legislators who seem to view it as a legitimate part of congressional debate. While there was a time when legislators warned that they would not vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling only when they knew that Congress was going to raise the debt ceiling, now more legislators are open to following through on the threat that the debt limit increase won't pass. Each time that they do it, the threat becomes more familiar, and more accepted by some. Finally, the budget wars are fueled by the 24-hour news media, with outlets on cable television and the Internet that are constantly in search of dramatic stories to win attention. The budget war offers great fodder. The possibility of a fiscal cliff offers political junkies a bit of the kind of thrill that ""Breaking Bad"" fans have felt every time Walter White extricates himself from another bind. As a result, legislators such as Cruz, who gained considerable attention over the past few weeks for his dramatic stand against Obamacare, are making a name for themselves and staying in the headlines. The budget process might not be good for the nation, but it is certainly a great way for a politician to receive attention. At some point there will be pressure to reform the process. The latest round of budget battles led a larger number of Republicans, like Sen. John McCain, to be openly critical of their colleagues and call for a very different approach. As Representative King, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, explained, ""I still think we should try to repeal the bill. But you repeal it the same way you passed it. You get bills through both houses of Congress, and you get the president to sign it."" Budget reform is possible. For instance, there has been some discussion about the possibility of repealing the need for a congressional vote to raise the debt ceiling. There have been several moments in U.S. history, such as in 1921 and 1974, when Congress overhauled the entire budget process. It might be time to start that debate again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Budget battles reoccur regularly, and each time seems worse .
Republicans have used the weapon of a shutdown to cripple Democratic presidents, he says .
Zelizer: When a tactic such as threatening to veto debt limit increase is used, it becomes the new normal .

"(CNN) -- ""It's like all our memories are gone."" That's what my brother said when he called to talk about the devastation Superstorm Sandy wreaked on the Jersey Shore, the summer playground of our youth. With those words I realized that as concerned and sad as I was about the effect of the storm, I was also mourning for a place that harbored so many happy memories for me growing up that may never be the same. My brother still lives in the Northeast, but I have long since moved to Atlanta and married a woman from Siesta Key, Florida. For vacations, we venture out to exotic spots. But the word ""vacation"" always conjures up images of the Jersey Shore in my mind, and I have often found it difficult to communicate to my wife and my Southern friends what an important cultural touchstone the Jersey Shore is for people in that region. All they know is the caricatured version presented by MTV. But for tens of millions of people in greater New York and Philadelphia who live a short drive or train ride away, the Jersey Shore has always been a weekend destination where families vacation year after year. New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities . It was not a coastline of resorts and golf courses, like so much of the South. It was grid-based towns that went right up to the beach and were capped off with boardwalks that stretched for miles. Back home in Pennsylvania, we all knew those towns. We knew which had the best piers with the best rides, and we knew that the best sausage and pepper sandwich was at a boardwalk stand in Seaside Heights. We knew that Lucy the Elephant was actually a hotel in Margate and that the places on the Monopoly board really existed. We also knew that ""the Shore"" meant only the Jersey Shore. Everywhere else was just the beach. But the shore was more than just a beach. It was carnival rides and boardwalks and the remnants of what entertainment looked like in the Victorian era. It was the birthplace of Miss America and the land of Springsteen. It was beach towns filled with memories made by generations of families. My grandparents were the first ones in my family who were born in America, and for them and every generation in my family, our first encounter with the ocean was at the Jersey Shore. As a result, I was able to do some of the same things in the same places my grandmother did, when as a young woman she would take the train from Philadelphia to Atlantic City with her girlfriends to frolic in the sand and walk the boardwalk. I could hang out on the beach and wander around the sights in Cape May, just like my mom did. It is a connection that binds generations. It was to the Jersey Shore that my brother and our high school friends went the day after senior proms, just like our dad did. And we both agree our best family vacation ever was in Lavallette in 1977, when he was 12 and I was 10. So many of our friends were there at the same time, and we could finally hang out on the boardwalk on our own. I loved it so much I vowed I would keep forever a T-shirt I got at a boat race we attended that week. And I have. It is now my 9-year-old son's favorite T-shirt and his special connection to the Jersey Shore. Entertainment: 'Jersey Shore' cast on Sandy devastation . When you are married to someone who grew up on an island with palm trees, it is hard to convince them the Jersey Shore is a worthy alternative. But I finally convinced my wife to go there for a family reunion when she was newly pregnant with our first child. We arrived when it was dark, and the cool, late summer air was damp with the ocean spray. I insisted that she walk up to the beach with me, and when we got there we turned, looked north and I showed her the boardwalk pier stretching out over the water, with a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster lighting up the night sky over the black ocean. I stood behind her, with my arms wrapped around her shoulders, and sang in a whisper into her ear: ""The amusement park rises bold and stark; kids are huddled on the beach in the mist."" I could finally show her that place was real. And that imagery was the imagery of my memories. And my parents' memories . . . and their parents' memories. And that was my Jersey Shore.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A group of Iranian intellectuals released a public apology this week for what they say is a long history of the country's mistreatment of members of the Baha'i faith. The letter lists 11 reasons why its signatories are ashamed of the past treatment of Baha'is. The apology -- titled, ""We are ashamed"" -- was published on the Web site Iranian.com and was signed by 42 Iranian professionals, all of whom do not live in Iran. ""As Iranian human beings, we are ashamed for what has been perpetrated upon the Baha'is in the last century and a half in Iran,"" the letter says. In the letter, the group detailed incidents of violence and discrimination that it says the Iranian government has perpetrated against Baha'is. The Islamic republic has been condemned by human-rights activists and governments across the globe for its treatment of members of the Baha'i faith. The Baha'i movement has said that six of its followers were arrested in January in Tehran, including one who works with Nobel peace laureate Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer and activist. Seven leaders of the group arrested in 2008 also remain in jail. Members of Baha'i -- who say they are targeted in the predominantly Shiite nation because of their faith -- have faced arrests and other oppression over the years. They say the persecution is part of a pattern that began in 1979. That's when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created. Baha'i -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- claims to have 5 million members across the globe and about 300,000 in Iran. The European Parliament passed a resolution in January that criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'is. The U.S. State Department also criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'i followers in a report last year.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery."" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January  2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners.  See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art » . Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing ""Inspiring Impressionism"" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's ""Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil"" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. ""The Louvre and the Ancient World"" and the companion show ""The Eye of Josephine,"" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings.   See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows » . The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's ""The Beggar Boy"" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to ""Inspiring Impressionism"" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre"" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's ""The Tiber"" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities ""visual evidence of connections."" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the ""moderns"" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: ""No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters.""

"(CNN) -- NATO forces patrolling the Gulf of Aden foiled a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker this weekend, a NATO spokesman said. The Canadian navy's HMCS Winnipeg helped foil a pirate attack on a Norwegian tanker Sunday, NATO says. Pirates attempted to capture the MV Front Ardennes at 6 p.m. Saturday and were apprehended seven hours later, Commander Chris Davies told CNN. A NATO-supported Canadian navy ship, the HMCS Winnipeg, was returning from escorting a World Food Program vessel in the gulf when it saw the Norwegian ship under attack, Davies said. A British Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Wave Knight, was also in the area. The pirates were captured at 1 a.m. Sunday after they threw weapons, ladders and scaling equipment overboard, Davies said. Several rounds of ammunition were found on the pirates' boat. The pirates were detained, but allowed to go free after questioning. There is currently no formal procedure for NATO personnel to follow once they have apprehended pirates, Davies noted. Their weapons are confiscated and they are then typically given provisions and released. The Sunday incident is the latest in a string of hijackings off the Horn of Africa, which have received more attention since pirates attacked a U.S.-flagged cargo ship on April 8 and took its captain hostage.

"(CNN) -- An Arizona state lawmaker's push to end the guarantee of birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants on Saturday set off a protest hundreds of miles away in Pacoima, a Los Angeles suburb. More than 1,500 people in this predominantly Latino community took part in the protest, many of them chanting ""Si, se puede,"" the Spanish version of President Obama's 2008 campaign slogan. The protesters fear that if Arizona passes the measure, other states will follow. Arizona state Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican, has proposed that birthright citizenship, a guarantee provided by the U.S. Constitution, be taken away from children of illegal immigrants. The guarantee, courts have ruled, was established by the 14th Amendment, which extended birthright citizenship to former slaves after the Civil War.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- An 11-year-old girl who lost her father made the world cry with her on Tuesday. Paris Katherine Jackson, 11, said goodbye to her father at the close of the memorial service. ""Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine,"" said Paris Katherine Jackson, the second of Michael Jackson's three children, as a massive memorial service for her father neared its end in downtown Los Angeles. ""And I just want to say that I love him so much,"" Paris added, before breaking down in tears and burying herself in the arms of her aunt, Janet Jackson. Her aunts, uncles and two brothers who were on stage at the Staples Center arena reached over to console Paris. Thousands of mourners in the audience dabbed their eyes with tissues. It was the first time they had heard from a girl who, along with her two siblings, have often been hidden by veils or blankets when seen with their father.  Watch Paris Jackson give a tearful goodbye » . ""Everybody just broke down,"" said Tracie Laymon, a filmmaker from Los Angeles, who was in the audience. ""Wow, it was really powerful."" It was the same refrain from other fans as they left the star-studded service or watched the broadcast on their television sets or online. At some points during the 90-minute program, global Web traffic was 31 percent above normal, said Akamai Technologies, which monitors Internet traffic.  Watch report on Facebook tributes » . Aisha Morgan said all the television stations at her workplace in Kingston, Jamaica, were turned to the memorial -- ""from upper management, all the way down."" ""Some persons cried,"" said Morgan, who sent in a photo to CNN's iReport. ""The atmosphere in one department was like a funeral."" Inside the Staples Center, Jackson lay at the foot of the stage in a closed, rose-draped, bronze casket. His brothers, who served as pallbearers, wore single white sequined gloves, a tribute to Jackson's signature look. Singers and sports celebrities took the stage and shared what Jackson meant to them. Between them, the performers have 40 Grammy awards -- a fitting tribute to a man who alone earned 13 in his lifetime. Jackson died on June 25 of cardiac arrest. The exact cause of death is pending toxicology tests, but speculation continues to swirl about the role of prescription drugs. Brother Marlon Jackson was among some who alluded to the controversies that surround the pop icon in death. The world, he said, could not understand what Jackson endured ""being judged and ridiculed."" ""How much pain can one man take?"" Marlon Jackson asked. ""Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone."" Pomp and precaution . The morning began with a half-hour gathering for several hundred family and friends inside a chapel at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery. Jackson's casket -- bronze with 14-karat gold plate handles, a velvet-lined interior and a reported price tag upward of $20,000 -- was then placed in a hearse for the 10-mile trip to the arena. The motorcade of black limousines and sports utility vehicles to the arena was accompanied by police cruisers and motorcycles, which shut down freeway ramps and caused a miles-long traffic backup. Three thousand police officers, almost one-third of the Los Angeles police force, were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell said.  Watch report from CNN.com's Nicole Lapin from L.A. » . In comparison, about 2,000 officers were deployed for the parade and celebration at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the L.A. Lakers' NBA championship victory last month. The mayor's office estimated the cost for security for the Staples ceremony to be between $2 million and $4 million. And the city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans to donate money to help with expenses. Leading into the event, police repeatedly asked fans without tickets to the service to watch from home. And, putting their worst-case scenarios to rest, fans seem to have complied. McDonnell said ticketless fans outside Staples numbered 5,000 or fewer, much lower than what police had anticipated. Inside the arena, Jackson's older brothers carried the coffin to the front of the stage, which was designed to resemble a church sanctuary with a stained-glass backdrop. ""Soon and very soon, we are going to see the King,"" sang the Andrae Crouch Choir. Tears and testimony . Singer Smokey Robinson set the tone for the event when he read a heartfelt letter from Diana Ross. Ross, a long-time friend that Jackson named as alternate guardian to his children in his will, explained in her letter why she was not there: . ""I am trying to find closure. I want you to know that even though I am not there at the Staples Center, I am there in my heart. I have decided to pause and be silent. This feels right for me. Michael was a personal love of mine, a treasured part of my world, part of the fabric of my life in a way that I can't seem to find words to express."" She then added: ""Michael wanted me to be there for his children, and I will be there if they ever need me.""

"(CNN) -- Amber Lemna says studying ""The Secret"" is changing her life for the better. The 2006 book and film discusses the law of attraction, something adherents say allows people to attract what they want by envisioning it and believing it will come. Lemna says she's used it to kick-start a business idea: attaching decorated tabs to credit cards so people can easily pull the cards from wallets. Thanks to ""The Secret,"" she says, she's attracted people and resources to help her and already is selling the tabs in 10 local stores. ""Nothing has been the same since I've listened to the CD [of the book],"" said Lemna, 29. ""I can control how my day goes."" So the Minneapolis, Minnesota-area insurance agent bristles when she hears people using the troubles of self-help entrepreneur James Arthur Ray, who appears in but did not create ""The Secret"" film, to bash the attraction principles. Ray integrates the law of attraction into his teachings on obtaining spiritual, financial, mental and physical wealth. He postponed all his scheduled events through the end of the year after three people died after spending time in a sweat lodge session he led near Sedona, Arizona, in October. Police are investigating the deaths, and Ray has said his organization is working with authorities to determine what happened; no charges have been filed. ""It works with or without him,"" Lemna said of the book and film -- both works of Australian TV producer Rhonda Byrne. ""[Ray is] just an advocate."" Self-help is a multibillion-dollar-a-year unregulated industry in the United States, according to John C. Norcross, professor of psychology at the University of Scranton. Norcross says hundreds of quality, research-supported self-help programs on career growth, health and self-esteem exist. But he and other critics say some gurus, promising secrets to greater happiness and wealth, offer advice that at best isn't proven effective and at worst could send someone down a poorly suited or dangerous path. ""You can publish anything making the most outrageous claims as long as it's not libelous,"" said Norcross, co-author of ""Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health."" Norcross takes particular umbrage at Ray and law of attraction advocates, saying they generally offer anecdotal evidence that their way works, but don't offer scientific evidence to support the claims. Ray, who has written books and holds seminars and other events, says on his Web site that he blends ""the practical and mystical into a usable and easy-to-access formula for achieving true wealth across all aspects of life."" His six-step Journey of Power series of events costs participants thousands of dollars. One of the steps, the Spiritual Warrior retreat, which was under way when the October sweat lodge deaths happened, costs $9,695 per person. ""When people are pursuing a program of undocumented effectiveness, they are not spending time and money pursuing a program they know works,"" Norcross said. A media representative for Ray declined to comment about the criticism. Dave Orton, who has attended several of Ray's programs, says Ray's techniques have helped him break habits and thoughts that hindered him and have given him tools to achieve goals ""in a more elegant and rapid manner."" The 33-year-old technology-company program manager from Boise, Idaho, says Ray's and other self-help programs helped him get his professional certification in project management. Orton, who wasn't at the event near Sedona, says the deaths were tragic and unacceptable. But he says he isn't turned off to the self-help industry or Ray's teachings, and he may be interested in attending another Ray event in the future. ""The results in my own life, that's what I'd trust more than a third-party study,"" Orton said. ""My [project management] certificate is hanging on the wall right now. It's not just a dream."" Psychologists: How to choose . Several people trained in psychology, however, told CNN that too many self-help authors and presenters offer little scientific evidence that backs up their claims. Gerald Rosen, a clinical psychologist in Seattle, Washington, says he believes more self-help books should undergo pre-publication testing -- especially those written by psychologists, who he says should be held to a high professional standard. ""When you look at a book for depression, there probably isn't a blurb on the back that says this book has been shown in studies to help 65 percent of those who have been diagnosed with this. There's just a claim that this can happen for you,"" said Rosen, a former chairman of the American Psychological Association's task force on self-help therapies. Norcross says that a lack of scientific evidence isn't the only thing to look out for. Other characteristics that should make consumers wary, he says: . • Authors or speakers who don't have formal training in the featured topic. ""They should look for someone with rigorous training at an accredited university and who has spent years investigating and conducting these treatments,"" Norcross said. • Programs that don't screen consumers for problems. For example, Norcross says, certain programs might be harmful for a person with bipolar disorder. • People who reject conventional knowledge and instead imply a revolutionary secret. ""It's marketing, essentially,"" Norcross said. • People who propose solutions for all problems instead of particular problems. Michael Shermer, executive director of the Skeptics Society, said consumers should be wary of programs that cost a lot of money but teach no hands-on skills. ""It's one thing to pay a trade school. It's another to pay the same kind of money to ... seek a mystical effect on your prosperity,"" said Shermer, who holds a master's degree in experimental psychology and a doctorate in the history of science. He also warns that the effects can be fleeting. ""Corporate America has wasted millions"" on motivational seminars, Shermer said. ""The marketing and sales guys get fired up, but the effects of those types of seminars are weeks at minimum, months at best. That's why a lot of them do corporate retreats every six months, because the effects fade."" Shermer suggests that consumers try out a self-help adviser's book or tape before committing to an expensive getaway ""to see if there's a connection for you."" People interested in a program also should talk to previous participants at least six months after they used it, he said. ""If you talked a day after, they would have to rationalize it to a certain extent [even if it were no good] because they just paid a lot of money,"" Shermer said. As for Lemna, she says the changes in her life are all the proof she needs that ""The Secret"" is working. ""I'm sure there are people who need [scientific evidence], fine. Then find something that works for you,"" she said.","Psychologists: Look for authors, teachers backed by research and formal training .

"The parents of North West have made it official. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West tied the knot at Fort di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, on Saturday, Kardashian's publicist told CNN. People reported Kardashian was walked down the aisle by Bruce Jenner while Andrea Bocelli sang ""Con te Partiró""; and Kris Jenner was seen in the front row wiping her eyes during the ceremony. Guests reportedly broke into applause twice during the ceremony: first when the couple kissed and when the newlyweds were presented. The wedding capped off a weekend of extravagant European affairs, starting with a brunch hosted by fashion designer Valentino in Paris on Friday. Later that evening, hundreds of guests were invited to the Palace of Versailles for a private tour and a surprise performance by Lana Del Ray. According to E!, the couple then flew guests to Florence for the wedding ceremony. The city has special meaning to them; Kanye said they conceived their daughter, North, there ""among the masterpieces of the Renaissance. This is the third marriage for Kardashian and West's first. The couple got engaged in October 2013, as seen on TV, after Kardashian gave birth to their daughter. But theirs was apparently a love affair years in the making. Reportedly it took the rapper nine years to finally win the woman of his dreams, but it was in March 2012 when they appeared together at Paris Fashion Week together that they were officially an item. Kardashian told Oprah Winfrey during a 2012 interview that she didn't know what took them so long. ""I think we've always had an attraction for each other, but we've always been in either other relationships or it just wasn't the right timing,"" she said. ""One day, I don't know, it just happened. It kind of like took me by surprise even."" In December 2012, Kardashian announced via her blog that she was pregnant with West's child. ""It's true,"" Kardashian wrote. ""Kanye and I are expecting a baby. We feel so blessed and lucky and wish that in addition to both of our families, his mom and my dad could be here to celebrate this special time with us."" She gave birth to her daughter in June 2013 and Kardashian praised West's parenting skills during an interview with talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres after the rapper proposed to her. ""He is honestly the most amazing dad,"" Kardashian said. ""He just loves her so much."" West clearly appreciates the family that they have now made legally official. ""Family time -- it's what Kim gave me,"" he told the BBC in September 2013. ""She gave me everything. She gave me a family. She gave me a support system.""

"(CNN) -- Syria accused Israel of firing rockets into the Damascus suburb of Jamraya on Sunday, striking a ""scientific research center,"" Syrian state TV reported. It is the second Syrian claim this year of a strike against what observers have described as a government defense research facility, and it comes one day after U.S. officials first told CNN that the United States believes Israel carried out an airstrike against Syria. Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the Syrian TV report. ""We do not comment on these reports at all,"" an IDF spokesperson said. The Syrian news report claimed the rocket attack on the research center aided rebels, who have been battling government forces in the region. In late January, reports surfaced that Israeli warplanes targeted the research facility. The Syrian government has said the airstrike killed two workers and injured five others. A U.S. official told CNN at the time the Syrian claims were false. The official said Israeli fighter jets targeted a Syrian government convoy carrying surface-to-air missiles bound for the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria denied there were such shipments. The report of rocket attacks come as sectarian violence erupted in northwestern Syria, where three consecutive days of killing by mostly Alawite forces have left hundreds of predominantly Sunni residents dead, opposition groups said Saturday. ""The regime attacked the town of Beyda and other neighboring areas from the sea with rockets before security forces and militias loyal to the regime entered the area and conducted mass executions,"" Free Syrian Army chief of staff Gen. Salim Idris said by phone from Antakya, Turkey. ""They want to establish a sectarian-based entity in the region,"" he said. State media have said their forces were seeking only to clear the area of ""terrorists,"" the term they have routinely used when referring to rebel forces. But the U.S. State Department said it was ""appalled by horrific reports that more than 100 people were killed May 2"" in Beyda, a suburb of Baniyas. ""We call on all responsible actors in Syria to speak out against the perpetration of unlawful killings against any group, regardless of faith or ethnicity,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in a statement. Opposition groups that included the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Free Syrian Army said the widespread killing in and around the coastal city of Baniyas continued Saturday as largely Alawite regime forces used tanks, battleships and missile launchers to hit largely Sunni neighborhoods in Baniyas. The government forces killed at least 200 people on Friday and Saturday in Baniyas and its suburbs, the LCC said Saturday. More than 200 others were killed there on Thursday, when the killings started early in the day, it said. Reliable information has been difficult to obtain because government forces controlled access to the village, the LCC said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said hundreds of Sunni families began fleeing Baniyas' southern neighborhoods at dawn Saturday, heading toward the cities of Tartous and Jableh. A graphic video posted by activists who said it was shot in the Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood showed people, including an infant, lying lifeless on the ground. Many bore what appeared to be bullet wounds and some appeared burned. CNN's access to war zones has been limited by the government and has not been able to confirm its authenticity. State-run Syrian TV filed reports from Beyda over the last two days reporting that government troops along with the National Defense militia, an armed Alawite group loyal to the government, ""have cleaned the area from armed terrorists"" after ""they burned civilians' homes and stores and terrorized the population."" The reporting was supported by interviews with members of the Syrian army. U.N. has warned of sectarian violence . Last December, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry warned that the civil war had become ""overtly sectarian."" It said government forces and militias, dominated by Alawites, had been attacking Sunnis -- who were ""broadly (but not uniformly)"" backing the rebel groups. And anti-government armed groups were targeting Alawites. Other minority communities, including some Christians, Armenians, Palestinians, Kurds and Turkmen, ""have also been caught up in the conflict, and in some cases forced to take up arms for their own defense or to take sides."" But it said the ""sectarian lines fall most sharply"" between Alawites and Sunnis. The ""increasingly sectarian nature"" of the fighting is a motivator for proxy groups fighting in Syria. Anti-government armed groups are composed of Sunnis from the Middle East and North Africa, the report said. Shiites from other countries have entered the conflict on behalf of Syria. The Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah has said its members are fighting. There are reports of Iraqi Shiites fighting in Syria and of Iran's Revolutionary Guards providing intellectual and advisory support. Christian communities across Syria have been under the gun and on the move. Homs, for example, was once home to 80,000 Christians, but the commission said most had escaped to Lebanon. ""With communities believing -- not without cause -- that they face an existential threat, the need for a negotiated settlement is more urgent than ever,"" the commission said. Al-Assad makes public appearance . Also Saturday, the country's president made his second public appearance this month, according to state-run Syrian Television. ""President Bashar al-Assad joins thousands of students and families of martyrs in Damascus University in inaugurating the Martyred Students Monument in memory of all the students who were killed in Syria,"" it said. The president's Facebook page posted a picture of the event. On May 1, al-Assad visited the Ummayad electrical plant to ""congratulate its staff and all the Syrian workers on the occasion of International Workers' Day,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Israel said to be flying over Lebanon . Israel was flying warplanes over Lebanon on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, the Lebanese army said. Lebanon's president, Gen. Michel Sleiman, condemned the violations as ""an attempt to shaken Lebanese stability,"" the state-run National News Agency reported Saturday. The Israeli military had no comment. But a source in the Israeli defense establishment told CNN's Sara Sidner, ""We will do whatever is necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist organizations. We have done it in the past and we will do it if necessary the future."" Israel appears to have struck Syria . Two U.S. officials told CNN on Friday that Israel appears to have conducted an airstrike into Syria on Thursday or Friday. Based on initial indications, the U.S. does not believe Israeli warplanes entered Syrian airspace to conduct the strikes. President Barack Obama told reporters on Friday that he did not foresee a scenario of ""American boots on the ground in Syria"" that would be good for that country or the region. Obama said other leaders in the region want to see al-Assad out of power.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Fertility issues were at the center of former TV chef Juan-Carlos Cruz's motivation in the alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill his wife, according to sources close to the couple. The former host of the Food Network's ""Calorie Commando"" was charged Monday with attempted murder and solicitation of murder for allegedly trying to hire homeless men to kill his wife. Two sources close the couple, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said their 20-year struggle to have a child overwhelmed them. After spending a lot of money on unsuccessful fertility treatments, Cruz's wife, Jennifer Campbell, was ""very depressed and talked about suicide,"" one source said. The sources suggested she may have wanted to end her life but that as a devout Roman Catholic, she believed suicide was a sin. The failure to have a successful pregnancy was ""pretty overwhelming thing in their lives,"" the second source said. The source closest to Campbell said she still loves her husband despite his arrest. The source would not comment on whether she was aware of the alleged planning before his arrest. The source closest to Cruz, 48, said he was ""nothing but a loving and devoted husband."" CNN was unable to talk Cruz or Campbell directly. The prosecution and police would not comment on the case. Cruz, arrested a week ago, remained behind bars pending a $2 million bond payment. A preliminary hearing was set for June 23. The criminal complaint filed Monday accused Cruz of trying to hire David Carrington and David Walters -- homeless men who go by the street names Little Dave and Big Dave -- to murder Campbell. It was not immediately clear who was Little Dave and who was Big Dave. If convicted, Cruz could get life in prison, a prosecution spokeswoman said. Assistant Deputy District Attorney Joseph Marcus would not talk about the case, but the homeless men allegedly solicited to carry out the hit spoke with celebrity news and gossip website TMZ on Saturday. One of them called Cruz ""very meticulous"" but ""very cheap"" in his planning. The plan fell apart when one of the men whom Cruz allegedly recruited told Santa Monica police, Sgt. Jay Trisler said. Trisler confirmed that the men interviewed by TMZ are the chief witnesses against Cruz. Little Dave told TMZ that he was approached first by Cruz, who asked him to kill his wife for cash, and he told his friend Big Dave. Big Dave said he told a Santa Monica police officer about the plot after he was arrested for loitering. ""We're very fortunate that we have a relationship and rapport with some of the homeless and that they were able to give us information,"" Trisler said. Santa Monica police began their undercover investigation of Cruz on May 7, Trisler said. Cruz was arrested at a dog park in the Cheviot Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon, he said. Big Dave and Little Dave got a place to stay while the investigation was under way. Santa Monica police put them in a hotel room to keep them out of sight, Big Dave said. ""They gave us two pizzas, a 12-pack of beer and a bottle of San Jose,"" he said. ""I love them."" Cruz, a Los Angeles resident, was an overweight pastry chef at the Hotel Bel Air until he changed his focus to promote low-calorie recipes. He wrote ""The Juan-Carlos Cruz Calorie Countdown Cookbook: A 5-Week Eating Strategy for Sustainable Weight Loss,"" published in 2007.

"(CNN) -- A young woman steals her way down darkened passages in Korogocho -- one of Kenya's largest slums. Crime, prostitution and drug use are rampant in the locality where a quarter of a million people reside and the young woman's eyes dart around erratically on the lookout for danger. It should be one of the happiest days of her life -- she is pregnant and has just gone into labor. She is also one of the fortunate few that can afford to go to hospital. Some women face a homebirth where, instead of medical equipment, they must make do with cotton wool and razorblades. But the journey to hospital leaves her vulnerable to opportunistic assault. For Aggrey Otieno, a human rights activist, this scenario is exactly what he is trying to prevent. A facilitator of social change, he has dedicated his life to improving the living conditions -- especially for women and children -- in the Kenyan slum where he spent his childhood. ""Korogocho has been in the news for all the bad things ... HIV/AIDS is very rampant. People who do drugs are here. People who do prostitution are here,"" says Otieno. ""It is our responsibility who stay in the slum, to bring the change that we want."" Read this: African midwife, Nobel Peace Prize? In his mission to help the area where he grew up, Otieno established Pambazuka Mashinani, -- meaning ""grassroots awakening"" in Swahili -- with an ethos of empowering ""urban poor in Nairobi slums."" After being granted a scholarship through the Ford Foundation, Otieno attended Ohio University in the United States, receiving a Masters degree in communications and development and a diploma in African community health. Using these learned skills, Otieno returned to Kenya to begin passing on his knowledge and start Pambazuka Mashinani. ""So many people in this community look up to me -- in fact I think I am the most educated person here because I have a Masters degree,"" he says. ""Because of that, I feel I have to really give back to this community."" He adds: ""It is out of that I am trying to bring other people together to save lives in Korogocho."" Otieno's organization now has a number of programs including reproductive health, research and advocacy, youth and women's empowerment. One of the most widespread obstacles for women in the slum is the fact that most cannot afford healthcare so part of Otieno's mission is to bring healthcare directly to them in the form of support groups with trained professionals. ""(Local people) get trained on a number of topics -- like today's topic is on breast feeding ... when you support them, they end up supporting their children and the whole community and they end up being empowered. ""I believe by empowering one woman, I have empowered so many communities."" In addition to community education workshops, Otieno has also set up a network of 24-hour mobile medical units called telemedicine centers, which provide assistance for pregnant women from afar via text messages and, where necessary, vans are sent to pick up women from the slums and take them to a local hospital. ""We are making use of simple technology to save lives in the community -- through some laptops and computers,"" says Otieno. ""We have integrated them with software installed in health facilities around Korogocho and we also have mobile phone texting technology. ""What we have done is come up with some software to link the front-line health workers that are supporting us -- these people have mobile phones and they visit pregnant women in their homes -- and at the moment they see complications, they send text messages to the telemedicine center."" Doctors then review the text messages and provide analysis and support for pregnancy-related matters. ""Eight percent of Kenyans -- regardless if you are poor -- own a mobile phone. People do a lot of texting. It is very cheap for you to text ... so that really inspired me."" One doctor on the end of a mobile phone is Peter Muguma who greatly admires the work Otieno has done to lower maternal mortality rates in Korogocho. ""So many women are dying during delivery, dying during pregnancy,"" says Muguma. ""In the slums it is due to poverty, lack of awareness, transport."" ""We get a text message on our computer.

"(CNN) -- NASA scientists say new data provided by twin spacecraft analyzing the sun will help them more accurately predict how so-called solar tsunamis wreak havoc on our planet. NASA says new data on so-called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet. The tsunamis -- powerful explosions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs -- produce solar cosmic rays that can interfere with technology, causing power blackouts and disrupting air traffic communications and cell phone networks. NASA says images captured by its twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in 3D to examine their structure, velocity, mass and direction. The solar ejections, its says, can release billions of tons of high-velocity plasma into space, producing a shockwave that generates cosmic rays which then plow into our atmosphere. These can create the brightly-colored auroras, more commonly known as the Northern or Southern lights, but also have more damaging effects, posing particular threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar physicist Angelos Vourlidas of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington said the new data from the STEREO craft -- launched into orbit in October 2006 -- will revolutionize the study of cosmic weather patterns. ""Before this unique mission, measurements and the subsequent data of a CME observed near the sun had to wait until the ejections arrived at Earth three to seven days later,"" he said in statement. ""Now we can see a CME from the time it leaves the solar surface until it reaches Earth and we can reconstruct the event in 3D directly from the images.""","NASA says new data will enable scientists to map solar tsunamis in 3D .

"An American couple that went missing on a bike trek through Peru has been spotted ""safe and sound,"" the South American country's top tourism official said Tuesday. Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand are heading upstream in a small boat on a jungle river, said Jose Luis Silva, Peru's minister of tourism and commerce. ""They're currently in a remote, paradise-like region of the Peruvian Amazon, which is difficult to access,"" he told CNN. But even as authorities trumpeted the news, Hand's mother said in a statement that she won't believe it until she hears directly from her son. ""We have not heard from them since January 25, nor have they accessed bank accounts since that time,"" mother Francine Fitzgerald said. ""We have only the worst to consider as to why."" The couple, who hail from the San Francisco area, left last November and began a series of social media posts chronicling the trip of their dreams -- a four-month bike adventure through South America. ""Will be riding my bike in other countries and out of contact for 4 months!"" Neal wrote in a November Facebook post before flying with Hand to Buenos Aires, Argentina. But for weeks, the couple shared photos online from their trek through Argentina, Chile and Peru, showing themselves posing beside their bikes on remote mountain roads, camping out in tents and smiling at the beach. In late January, however, their Internet postings stopped and calls to their cell phones went unanswered. Family members say no one has been able to get in touch with them since then. Fitzgerald said both the U.S. Embassy in Peru and the country's interior ministry have called to say that Neal and Hand were spotted. But that's not enough, she said. ""Let me reiterate, until we have PROOF OF LIFE, we cannot celebrate these rumors and sightings,"" she wrote on a Facebook page set up to facilitate a search for the couple. ""Proof of life is my son's voice on the phone and a picture of him holding the missing poster."" Silva told CNN that the tourism ministry learned of the couple's location from police, who received a report from a clinic in the town of Angoteros after sending out a nationwide alert about the missing couple. The ministry will send a hydroplane tomorrow to shoot video of the couple and provide proof they're doing OK, he said. ""They have no idea of the commotion they have caused in the media,"" he said, ""because they simply can't communicate with family from where they currently are."" Neal and Hand, both 25, according to a family flyer, were last seen in Lima, the Peruvian capital. But some of the areas they planned to visit are out of cell phone and Internet reach. The Peruvian National Police earlier told CNN that the manager of a hostel in Pucallpa, where the couple stayed, confirmed to a police investigator they reached the jungle city in early February. The manager of Arco Iris Amazonica, a small hotel in the rain forest city of Iquitos, told police the couple stayed there on February 16 and told him they planned to travel to the town of Naplo, a 15-day trek. Peru is known for the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, located in the Cusco region, which attract hundreds of thousands of international travelers each year. Two weeks ago, the U.S. Embassy in Lima issued a security message warning Americans of ""a potential kidnapping threat in the Cusco area."" ""The Embassy has received information that members of a criminal organization may be planning to kidnap U.S. citizen tourists in the Cusco and Machu Picchu area,"" the message said. But it also clarified that ""thousands of U.S. citizens routinely travel to the Cusco region without undue incident. The U.S. Embassy remains confident of the Peruvian government's efforts to ensure the safety of all tourists in the region."" Peru's tourism minister said Tuesday that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the negative impact of reports of the missing American couple. The reason the couple has been out of touch for so long has nothing to do with any crime, he said. ""These two young people have fallen in love with Peru,"" Silva said. ""They have visited off-the-beaten-path places and it seems like they're having a blast -- so much so that they have forgotten to communicate with their families.""","Peru's tourism minister say Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand were found in the Amazon .

"(CNN) -- NASA and Japan improved our world view this week, or at least our view of the world. This image using ASTER imagery shows the Himalayan glaciers in Bhutan. The American space agency and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry have released a new digital topographic map of Earth that accurately portrays more of our planet than ever before. The new map consists of 1.3 million images taken by NASA's Terra satellite that have been pieced together to form a unified picture of the planet. The images were taken by a Japanese imaging instrument called the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, or ASTER. ""This is the most complete, consistent global digital elevation data yet made available to the world,"" said Woody Turner, a program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington. The map covers more than 99 percent of Earth's land mass from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Antarctic Circle. During February 2000, space shuttle Endeavour mapped about 80 percent of the planet's surface. ""The ASTER data fill in many of the voids in the shuttle mission's data, such as in very steep terrains and in some deserts,"" said Michael Kobrick, a shuttle project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the program. ""NASA is working to combine"" the new data with that from the shuttle and other sources ""to produce an even better global topographic map.""","New digital topographic map reveals more of Earth than ever before .

"Vatican City (CNN) -- Call him Pope Francis, the pontiff of firsts. When Jorge Bergoglio stepped onto the balcony at the Vatican on Wednesday to reveal himself as the new leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, he made history as the first non-European pope of the modern era, the first from Latin America, the first Jesuit and the first to assume the name Francis. What do you think about the new pope? Tell us. The new pope then quickly made another kind of history, breaking with tradition in his first public act before the 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square. Rather than bless the crowd first, he asked them to pray for him. ""Let us say this prayer, your prayer for me, in silence,"" he told the cheering crowd. The willingness by Francis to dispense with tradition was interpreted by a Vatican spokesman as a sign he will be willing to chart his own path in other ways. Pope's name choice 'precedent shattering' ""We have a pope who probably upset some people tonight by not following the formula,"" the Rev. Tom Rosica said. The pontiff also broke with another tradition by refusing to use a platform to elevate himself above the cardinals standing with him as he was introduced to the world as Pope Francis. ""He said I'll stay down here,"" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York and the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. ""He met each of us on our own level."" Francis, wearing white papal robes, appeared on a rain-soaked night to the throngs shortly after being elected by cardinals in what apparently was the fifth round of voting on the second day of the conclave. ""As you know, the duty of the conclave was to appoint a new Bishop of Rome,"" he said. ""It seems to me that my brother cardinals have chosen one who is from faraway. But here I am. I would like to thank you for your embrace."" As pope, Bergoglio takes the helm of a Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy. First Latin American pope 'very exciting' Conservative reformer . The 76-year-old Bergoglio, who served as the archbishop of Buenos Aires, is the first pope to take the name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, revered among Catholics for his work with the poor. St. Francis is viewed as a reformer of the church, answering God's call to ""repair my church in ruins."" The pontiff is considered a straight shooter who calls things as he sees them, and a follower of the church's most social conservative wing. As a cardinal, he clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. Latin America is home to 480 million Catholics. By choosing Bergoglio, the cardinals sent a strong message about where the future of the church may lie. According to a profile by CNN Vatican analyst John Allen and published by the National Catholic Reporter, Francis was born in Buenos Aires to an Italian immigrant father. 5 things to know about the new pope . He is known for his simplicity. He chose to live in an apartment rather that the archbishop's palace, passed on a chauffeured limousine, took the bus to work and cooked his own meals, Allen wrote. Francis has a reputation for being a voice for the poor. World reacts . Word of the election of Pope Francis, who was not considered a front-runner among analysts, quickly spread around the globe, with everyone from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to U.S. President Barack Obama offering congratulations. ""As the first pope from the Americas, his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world, and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans, those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day,"" Obama said. World reacts to new pope . Ban said the new pope shares common goals with the United Nations, from the promotion of peace to social justice. ""We also share the conviction that we can only resolve the interconnected challenges of today's world through dialogue,"" he said. Nowhere was the reaction to Bergoglio's selection as pope more surprising than in Latin America. ""I am truly still very surprised ... not just that a Latino pope came out, but that he is an Argentinian from Buenos Aires,"" the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti told CNN en Espanol. Calling Benedict . The new pope called his predecessor, Benedict XVI, after he was elected, Rosica said. Francis plans to visit with Benedict on Thursday ahead of an evening Mass with the cardinals in the Sistine Chapel, according to the Vatican . Francis participated in the conclave that elected Benedict in April 2005. He was widely reported to be a runner-up to Benedict in the election. The new pontiff will deliver the traditional Angelus blessing from the Vatican on Sunday, Rosica said. Francis will be formally installed as pope at a Mass on Tuesday, according to the Vatican. What's in a name? Bergoglio's selection of the name of Pope Francis is ""the most stunning"" choice and ""precedent shattering,"" Allen said. ""The new pope is sending a signal that this will not be business as usual."" The name symbolizes ""poverty, humility, simplicity and rebuilding the Catholic Church,"" Allen said. St. Francis of Assisi was born in 1181 or 1182 the son of a rich Italian cloth merchant, according to the Vatican website. After ""a carefree adolescence and youth,"" Francis joined the military and was taken prisoner. He was freed after becoming ill, and when he returned to Assisi, Italy, a spiritual conversion began, and he abandoned his worldly lifestyle. In a famous episode, Christ on the cross came to life three times in the small Church of St. Damian and told him: ""Go, Francis, and repair my Church in ruins,"" Pope Benedict XVI said, according to Vatican's website. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Hada Messia reported from Vatican City, and Chelsea J. Carter wrote and reported from Atlanta. CNN's Dana Ford, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Pope Francis refused to stand on an elevated platform, a cardinal says .

"(CNN)Who doesn't like a new look? New Year, new you, amiright? An updated 'do can ""hair-ald"" a new phase in your life, signifying a fresh start. And maybe that's what the reclusive leader of North Korea was going for when he modified his almost boyish over-the-top-flop to a higher, angular, more severe cut. The look first debuted at his New Year's address in January. After all, Kim Jong Un -- following in the footsteps of his father, Kim Jong Il, dear leader and eternal chief  of the Workers' Party of Korea -- is cracking down. A resolution he read at the meeting of the party's Central Committee on Wednesday reminded party organizations that they must ""wage an all-party intensive campaign against abuse of power, bureaucratism, irregularities and corruption,"" according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Kim's new image got attention on social media, with some asking -- tongue in cheek -- if the new hairstyle was a nod to his father and grandfather. ""Kim Jong Un has an amazing new haircut. We have many, many questions,"" Amanda Taub wrote on Vox.com. Others jumped in to share their feelings on the fade. ""The Joey Essex haircut goes drastically wrong as it reaches North Korea,"" tweeted Adam Taylor. Some commented on the new shape of the style. ""Kim Jong Un shows off new trapezoidal hair style, tiny eyebrows,"" said Allen & Kelley Co. The resolution read by Kim at the meeting also called on party organizations to ""conduct the organizational and political work in a fresh and viable manner so that the officials, party members and working people may turn out as one with the revolutionary faith, fighting spirit and revolutionary pluck to devotedly carry out the teachings of Kim Jong Il and the party's policies under any condition."" Speaking of ""pluck"" -- Kim's eyebrows also apparently had a brush with the scissors, or tweezers. Recent photos show a much-abbreviated set atop a face that looks a little larger. Maybe the smaller eyebrows make it seem that way. But surely the 30-something leader of one of the most closed-off countries in the world has more important things to do than to worry himself with such superficial matters. Like coming up with some more patriotic slogans to mark the 70th anniversary of the isolated regime's founding this year. Some of the more colorful so far:  ""Let us turn ours into a country of mushrooms!"" (presumably not a reference to Kim's old hairstyle) or ""More stylish school uniforms ... for our dear children!"" It's not clear if the dear children will be urged to emulate their dear leader's new 'do.

"A group of North Korean journalists could cancel a trip to Britain because officials in the secretive regime are paranoid about the spread of Ebola, it is claimed. The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media in a course part-funded by the UK taxpayer. But now North Korea's strict Ebola-control measures risk thwarting a project which had been criticised as simply teaching the regime's spin doctors how to more effectively peddle propaganda. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspecting a newly-built Mushroom Farm in Pyongyang: A plan for 46 North Korean journalists to visit the UK could be thwarted by the country's tight Ebola control measures . North Korea has been under effective lockdown for more than three months to keep the Ebola virus from crossing its borders, with all arrivals facing 21 days quarantine before they can enter the country. Since the Ebola measures were announced in late October, visas for nonessential travel have been halted and North Korean media has launched a daily barraage of constant reports depicting the dangers of the disease. North Korea's journalistic exchange trip appears to be the latest victim of the arguably over-enthusiastic health protection measures, according to a report in the the Sunday Express which cited 'Foreign Office sources'. The paper had earlier broken news of the expected visit by 46 journalists, who work in North Korea's tightly controlled state media and, its report claims, face execution if they dare criticise their country's regime. Lord Alton of Liverpool, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on North Korea, told reporters Caroline Wheeler and Alex Stevenson a cancellation could help the ministers avoid embarrassment . 'The Foreign Office might see it as a blessing in disguise if they can be given a reason for reconsidering giving a group of people whose speciality is propaganda rather than journalism the opportunity of coming to the UK,' he said. 'I think it has less to do with Ebola and more to do with the insecurity of the regime and their determination to try to prevent any influence by foreigners, aid workers or diplomats.' Kim gives field guidance to managers at the mushroom farm: The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last month it is funding the project, which will be delivered by the Thomson Foundation and is called 'Inside Out: Working in North Korea to connect its journalists to an internet world.' It was claimed it could cost the UK taxpayer as much as £70,000, but the FCO said no figures for the course had been finalised, and said it was being run as part of the 'critical engagement' activities with the country. In a written answer to the House of Lords Baroness Anelay of St Johns said 'The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting.' North Korea is one of the most controlled media environments in the world. All news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored. There is just one news agency, the North Korean Central News Agency, that operates throughout the country. Internet access is poor, with many north Koreans only able to access a form of an intranet. Radios and televisions supplied to North Koreans come pre-tuned to Government-controlled stations such as Korean Central Television. Since Kim Jong-un took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country. This has included an interview Dennis Rodman gave to CNN after travelling to the country earlier this year, following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong-un. But a lot of the news coming from North Korea appears to be tightly stage-managed. Information about the country's economic difficulties or famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences. She added: 'The project aims to expose participants to the UK media, instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources.' The students took part in a pilot workshop in Pyongyang in October and the study tour to the UK was expected take place in the coming weeks. North Korea has one of the most restrictive attitudes to the media in the world, precisely controlling information coming into and out of the country. Journalists have to be a member of the Workers' Party and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds. There is just one agency service for the country. A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'The UK has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in North Korea. Last month, the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the United Nations. 'This project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the DPRK. It is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in North Korea.' A United Nations report earlier this year found that North Koreans are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology. It said: 'There is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association.' The report said that propaganda is used by the State to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished, with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the 'ultimate' punishments. An example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when Kim Jong-il died in 2011, but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released.","Ebola-control measures have put the paranoid state on total lockdown .

"(CNN) -- The bitter family dispute over the care of renowned radio announcer Casey Kasem got more bizarre Sunday. Before paramedics wheeled Kasem to an ambulance, his wife, Jean, threw a hunk of meat at one of his daughters who had come to accompany her father to the hospital, officials said Monday. It is the latest incident in the feud between Kerri Kasem and Jean Kasem, who has been married to the former host of ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40"" since 1980, over who should decide his medical care. Casey Kasem has Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's. He is in stable condition at a medical facility in Washington, according to a representative for Kerri Kasem. She claims her father's health has worsened since the last time she saw him weeks ago at a nursing home in Santa Monica, California. She had won a California court order in May to become the temporary conservator for her ailing father, but he went missing for a few days from a nursing home there before being found in Washington state with his wife, Kerri's stepmother. On Friday morning, a Kitsap County, Washington, judge granted Kerri Kasem permission to take her father to a doctor. Kerri Kasem went to the home Sunday, her representative, Danny Deraney, said. She stayed on the street while paramedics went to get the 82-year-old icon, Deraney said. As she waited, Jean Kasem approached and hurled something at Kerri Kasem while referring to King David of the Bible, saying she was throwing the meat at ""the dogs."" A video provided to CNN by Deraney showed part of the incident, and in it, Jean Kasem walks down a driveway, throws underhanded a block of meat, which skips on the pavement toward the person holding the camera. Kerri Kasem said it was a pound of hamburger. A spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office said no deputies saw the meat thrown but several witnesses described it. There was no assault complaint, Deputy Scott Wilson said. CNN attempted to contact Jean Kasem's attorney, Craig Marcus, on Monday but didn't get an immediate response. Wilson said the Kasems are due in Kitsap County court again on Friday. Three weeks ago, a California court awarded Kerri Kasem temporary durable power of attorney and health care directive and has ordered Jean Kasem to surrender Casey Kasem's passport to the daughter. The California judge also ordered that Casey Kasem can't travel anywhere without a court order until a doctor clears him. One of Casey Kasem's other daughters, Julie Kasem, and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have said her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. But Julie and Kerri Kasem and their brother, Mike Kasem, have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father. Jean Kasem said in court papers last year that the three children ""single-handedly and irreparably shattered"" the couple's lives by deploying public demonstrations and attacks in the media, according to CNN affiliate KCBS. Kerri Kasem's temporary conservatorship over her father is in effect until June 20, when another California court hearing is scheduled on whether to make the conservatorship permanent.

"(CNN) -- In a weekend filled with crashes, rookie Marc Marquez avoided the mayhem. Marquez took the lead in the MotoGP standings after winning the German Grand Prix in his Honda ahead of Yamaha pair Cal Crutchlow and nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi. Marquez, on pole, lost the lead on the first lap as Rossi pounced but recovered by lap three. In the end he beat Crutchlow by a comfortable 1.559 seconds over the 30 laps, with the revitalized Rossi a further eight seconds adrift in eastern Germany. ""I hadn't expected to control the race like that,"" said the 20-year-old Marquez, who suffered his own share of crashes earlier in the season. Marquez now leads teammate Dani Pedrosa by two points -- 138 to 136 -- although 10 races remain. Pedrosa, the winner in Germany the previous three years, injured his left shoulder in a heavy crash in practice Saturday and missed qualifying. Tests revealed he suffered a minor fracture and on Sunday morning he decided not to take part in the race. Reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo broke his left collarbone in practice for the Dutch Grand Prix last month and suffered more damage when he lost control of his Yamaha in practice Friday. Altogether there were nearly 20 crashes over the weekend on the Sachsenring, a circuit with an abundance of challenging left turns. With less than 10 laps remaining, it appeared as if Crutchlow -- nursing a hand injury himself -- was ready to make a charge. He narrowed Marquez's lead from 1.8 seconds to about 1.6. But Marquez didn't lose more ground and coasted home for a second victory this term, adding to his win in Texas in April. ""I'm happy,"" said Marquez. ""It's great to win, but you shouldn't forget that both Pedrosa and Lorenzo weren't here."" Even though he didn't challenge for the lead most of the race, Rossi claimed a second consecutive podium finish after winning the Dutch Grand Prix -- the first time he stood atop the podium in three years. ""I am happy, but I had thought I'd do better,"" said Rossi. ""I had a few problems with the rear tires."" It's not known whether Lorenzo and Pedrosa will be ready for next week's race in California.","Rookie Marc Marquez leapfrogs Dani Pedrosa in the overall MotoGP standings .

Between 12 and 14 cars from a CSX freight train were involved in the derailment, which occurred along the James River and left oil burning along the river's surface, city government spokeswoman JoAnn Martin said. About 50,000 gallons of crude oil are missing from the tankers, she said. It's unclear how much of the oil burned in the blaze and how much spilled into the water. Buildings near the derailment were evacuated for several hours, and firefighters let the fire burn out on its own, she said. Travis Uhle was working at the Depot Grill when he came out and witnessed the crash. ""You just saw it going sideways on two wheels and then one went down, and the train just kept on coming,"" Uhle told CNN affiliate WDBJ. ""And then just a dogpile on top of that."" At least three tank cars fell into the river, a photograph taken at the scene showed. Lynchburg police Lt. David Gearheart said the fire was contained, but still burning, four hours after the derailment. CSX said three of the cars caught fire after the derailment, the cause of which wasn't known Wednesday. ""CSX is responding fully, with emergency response personnel, safety and environmental experts, community support teams and other resources on site and on the way,"" it said. ""We are committed to fully supporting the emergency responders and other agencies, meeting the needs of the community and protecting the environment."" William Hayden, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, said it was ""too soon to say"" what the environmental impact of the accident would be. The spill was contained before it stretched more than a quarter of a mile downriver, he said, but it wasn't clear Wednesday evening how much oil had spilled into the James. ""We have people on the scene providing technical assistance to make sure the leak is contained properly,"" Hayden said. An oil boom in North Dakota and Canada has led to a fourfold increase in the amount of crude shipped by rail since 2005, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Environmentalists and regulators have been paying more attention to those shipments since a July derailment and fire killed 47 people in a small town in Quebec. In March, environmentalists warned against having trains hauling oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale pass through downtown Lynchburg en route to a storage depot in Yorktown. Glen Besa, director of Virginia's Sierra Club chapter, said Wednesday's accident only heightens those worries. ""This train track runs right through the heart of Richmond, by the way. This could easily have happened in the heart of the capital city,"" Besa said. He said it wasn't clear whether the oil would burn off completely without leaving residues on the ground or in the river. ""These are the questions that should have been asked before we started doing this,"" he said. Casey Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said Virginia received just under $400,000 last year in Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparation grants. She noted, too, that the department has held two all-day hazmat transportation training workshops in the state since September. The volume of oil spilled or burned wasn't immediately known. The NTSB and the Federal Railroad Administration are sending investigators to the site, those agencies said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was monitoring the air at the request of state officials, EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Martin said Lynchburg's drinking water wasn't affected by the spill. But in Richmond, more than 100 miles downriver, authorities have begun drawing drinking water out of a separate canal rather than the James as a precautionary measure, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Public Utilities. John Aulbach, director of the state Office of Drinking Water, said it would take three to four days for any oil that may have spilled to reach Richmond, and it would be ""very diluted"" before it reached that point. Other communities can bypass the river as well. ""We're not expecting any effects to drinking water,"" Aulbach said.

Ahlers contributed to this report.","NEW: Official: 50,000 gallons of crude oil are missing from the tankers .

"(CNN) -- The death of a man who fell from an upper deck Sunday during a home game of the Chicago Bears has been ruled an ""accident"" by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office, a spokeswoman said Monday. The man was identified as Stuart Haverty, 23, of Chicago, and an autopsy Monday concluded that the cause of his death was multiple injuries from a fall, the spokeswoman said. Haverty fell from the upper level of the Bears' Soldier Field to the ground outside the stadium, police said. The incident happened around 5 p.m. Sunday while the Bears were playing the Philadelphia Eagles, said Veejay Zala of the Chicago Police Department. Haverty was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at 5:27 p.m. The incident marked the second such deadly fall during a pro sports game in as many weeks. Last week, a 2-year-old boy fell to his death from a luxury suite at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The boy fell at the conclusion of a National Basketball Association game and later died at the hospital. In July, a fan trying to catch a foul ball at a Texas Rangers game in Arlington, Texas, fell 30 feet, injuring himself and four others. Tyler Morris tumbled over the railing on the club level of the stadium, hit the railing on the suite level and then landed on the lower deck. His injuries were not life-threatening.

"(CNN) -- Danish veteran Thomas Bjorn carded six straight birdies on the back nine at Wentworth to revive his third round in spectacular fashion and take a five-shot lead into the final round of the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth. Bjorn, who has been at the head of affairs since a 10-under 62 in the first round, was slipping back through the field after dropping three shots in his opening five holes Saturday until he began his incredible run. A birdie on the sixth was the forerunner to his charge from the 11th -- which ended when he missed a three-foot birdie putt on the 17th for seven in a row. He completed his round on the 18th with his seventh birdie in eight holes for a five-under 67. That took him to 15-under 201, with England's two-time champion Luke Donald leading the chasers after a 68. Ireland's Shane Lowery, who led overnight on 10-under with Bjorn, was next best, a further shot back. Former World No.1 Rory McIlroy recovered from a double bogey on his opening hole to card a 69 to be tied fourth on eight-under with Dutchman Joost Luiten (67) but seven shots behind the rampaging Bjorn. ""I would have to shoot ridiculously low tomorrow to have any realistic chance but even then Thomas is so far ahead,"" Northern Ireland's McIlroy told the official European Tour website. The 43-year-old Bjorn has taken a particular liking to the back nine on the West Course, shooting 16-under for this half as against one-over for the front. ""I had a terrible start with some poor decisions but I settled myself down and knew I could play this back nine pretty well. I got the momentum and kept it going,"" he said. ""I'm in a strong position going into tomorrow but the job is not done yet. ""There is a lot of golf to play and I know there are top guys just behind me who can shoot very low as well. So I have to maintain my concentration and form to the end."" Heavy overnight rain delayed the start of the third round by three hours and players were allowed to place their golf balls on the fairways in preferred lies. It is the 60th edition of the prestigious tournament with the last 30 stagings at Wentworth, which is also the headquarters of the European Tour. Meanwhile, in the Colonial tournament on the PGA Tour, David Toms, Chad Campbell, Chris Stroud and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama shared the lead on seven-under after the third round. In a bunched leaderboard, there were 49 players within five shots of the lead, including FedExCup points leader Jimmy Walker (tied for fifth at six-under and world number one Adam Scott of Australia (tied for 11th, two shots back.","Thomas Bjorn leads PGA Championship at Wentworth .

"(CNN) -- Bella Homes LLC, a real estate investment company, and its principals are being sued by the federal government and the state of Colorado for allegedly preying on homeowners in foreclosure. Bella Homes LLC, is a limited liability company organized in Delaware. According to the lawsuit, the company operates from the principals' private residences in Arizona and Georgia, and maintains ""virtual offices"" in Atlanta and Scottsdale, Arizona. The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers and U.S. Attorney John Walsh and announced in a joint press release, alleges Bella Homes scammed more than 450 unsuspecting homeowners across the nation, including five in Colorado. The company took in more than $3 million in ""rent"" between March 2010 and this February, according to a press release from the Colorado attorney general's office. The Department of Justice alleges Bella Homes convinced homeowners to transfer their home titles to the company and enter into a type of lease agreement, where the homeowners would then rent or lease their homes back for a fee. During the lease period, Bella Homes claimed if would work to stop foreclosure and would purchase the homeowners' mortgages, according to the release. In exchange, Bella Homes allegedly promised homeowners they could avoid eviction, foreclosure and ruining their credit. The company also told homeowners they would have an exclusive option to ""repurchase their homes in three years for 90 percent of its fair market value and receive credit for 60 percent of the rent paid to Bella Homes,"" according to the release. Homeowners would also ""enjoy a mortgage payment following their repurchase that is 40 percent to 60 percent lower than previous payments."" The complaint alleges Bella Homes did not pay off or assume the existing mortgage, nor did it make make mortgage, tax or insurance payments on the property. Prosecutors contend the promises made by Bella Homes were false and the company actually does very little to actually help homeowners. Calls and e-mails to Bella Homes LLC and its Georgia attorney were not returned over several days. ""Bella Homes gave false hope to desperate homeowners, taking advantage of their desire to do anything to save their homes,"" said U.S. Attorney John Walsh. ""Bella Homes's actions not only hurt those vulnerable homeowners, but the housing market generally. The company will now face the consequences of its misconduct."" U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger granted a temporary restraining order against Bella Homes on February 15 that prohibited the company from entering into additional deals, and froze Bella Homes' assets. On Sunday, Bella Homes website, bellahomesllc.net, was no longer available. Only the message ""This Account Has Been Suspended"" appeared on the site. Bella Homes does not contest the facts, according to court documents, and it consented to stop making real estate transactions. In addition, the company voluntarily arranged to set aside $500,000 for restitution, pending a resolution in the case. Bella Homes also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to minimize the negative impact on homeowners and provide a list of homeowners in the Bella Homes program, according to court documents. In the release, Suthers said Colorado law prohibits a loan modification company to charge a homeowner an upfront fee. The company can charge for services rendered, but only once the services are completed. He further warned homeowners that any time someone stops making payments on their mortgage, foreclosure could result. Bella Homes and its principals have not filed a response to the allegations in federal court yet, but the parties are expected to be in court March 6 for a scheduling conference.","Prosecutors allege Bella Homes scammed 450 homeowners .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's embattled pick to be ambassador to Iraq withdrew his nomination Monday, a day before facing an uncertain vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Brett McGurk came under fire from Republicans and some Democrats for a variety of complaints; most notably for what senators said was poor judgment when he used an official government e-mail account to exchange flirtatious e-mails with a Wall Street Journal reporter while the two were stationed in Baghdad in 2008. The two were later married. In his resignation letter, McGurk said his withdrawal ""is in the best interests of the country"" because ""Iraq urgently needs an ambassador."" McGurk's wife: I've become 'collateral damage' ""The most difficult part of this process,"" McGurk said, ""was watching my wife become a part of it. She is the most precious thing in the world to me, and the depiction of our relationship has been both surreal and devastating. We have also witnessed real sacrifice and suffering in Iraq and know that nothing should be allowed to distract from the pressing work that must be done to build a better future there."" McGurk said he made the decision to withdraw Saturday and, in dramatic language, revealed it came as he was visiting the section in Arlington National Cemetery ""where so many heroes of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars now rest in peace."" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor issued a statement thanking McGurk for his years of service to the United States. ""He served two administrations, and his commitment to the national interest and to the mission was always clear,"" Vietor said. ""He has proved himself to be a skilled diplomat willing to take on some of the toughest challenges at the toughest times in a difficult region. While we regret to see Brett withdraw his candidacy there is no doubt that he will be called on again to serve the country."" GOP senators oppose choice of nominee for Iraq envoy . It was not clear if the Foreign Relations Committee would have approved McGurk. The committee is made up of 10 Democrats and nine Republicans, and therefore, a single Democrat could have blocked McGurk's nomination if all Republicans voted against him. At least two Democrats -- Ben Cardin of Maryland and Ben Casey of Pennsylvania -- said they had concerns about the nomination. Six Republican members of the committee wrote the president last week urging him to withdraw McGurk's nomination because they said he lacked the management experience to run such a large embassy and because they say he ""botched"" negotiations over the Status of Forces agreement for post-war Iraq. Of the controversial e-mails, the Republicans said: ""The public release of information detailing unprofessional conduct demonstrates poor judgment and will affect the nominee's credibility in the country where he has been nominated to serve."" In the wake of the scandal, McGurk's wife, Gina Chon, resigned her position at the Wall Street Journal. In an e-mail to friends Friday, she said the e-mails she traded with McGurk ""which were exposed just before Brett's confirmation hearing reflected flirtatious banter and nothing more."" ""I feel like I have become collateral damage in this process,"" Chon wrote. ""And, after witnessing all I have, I'm amazed that anyone would want to become a public official.

"The uptick in attacks by Afghan security forces against coalition troops has hit home, with all troops at NATO headquarters and all bases across Afghanistan now ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock, CNN learned Friday. Gen. John Allen, the NATO commander in Afghanistan, ordered the move, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the orders. The order, made in recent days, was divulged amid two more so-called green-on-blue or insider attacks Friday. An Afghan police officer opened fire on U.S. troops in Farah province in southwestern Afghanistan, killing two service members, the NATO-led command said. Two International Security Assistance Force troops and an Afghan service member were wounded by another Afghan service member in Kandahar province, in the south. The order comes as coalition forces adopt and study measures aimed at thwarting such attacks. In Afghan combat situations, all troops are armed.  But at other locations, only base security forces had been regularly armed. Those troops have been called into action when insurgents have launched attacks on the base. Coalition steps up fight against Afghan 'green-on-blue' attacks . Now, anyone who goes to the base headquarters would see that all troops, regardless of their tasks, carry weapons with a magazine of ammunition attached, a U.S. official confirmed. Troops now could fire against an attacker within seconds by sliding a lever on their weapons to make a round drop into the firing chamber. Loaded weapons are being carried both in the open outdoor areas of the base and inside buildings and meeting rooms. Allen and his top commanders live and work at the Kabul NATO headquarters, attached to the U.S. Embassy. The Friday green-on-blue attacks follow a claim purportedly from Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar that fighters are infiltrating Afghan security forces to attack NATO-led forces on their bases. ""Many Afghans in the rank and files of the enemy have shown a willingness to help the (Taliban) in a shrewd manner,"" said a statement posted on militant websites Thursday and obtained by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the activities of militant groups on the Web. ""As a result, the foreign invaders and their allies at their military centers and bases are suffering crushing blows by these heroic soldiers."" CNN can't independently verify the authenticity of the statement, which was released in advance of this weekend's Eid al Fitr celebrations that mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The Taliban are known routinely to claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers. Omar also urged employees of the Afghan government to seek out the group's newly established ""Call and Guidance, Luring and Integration"" departments that have been established throughout the country ""so that they may leave the enemy ranks and join the fighters,"" according to SITE. Omar's statement drew a sharp response from Allen, who accused the Taliban leader of issuing ""an unmistakable message of death, hate and hopelessness for the Afghan people"" on the eve of the Eid celebrations. ""The pride of the Afghan people has been smeared by killers who pose as soldiers and police, yet they represent the worst of humanity,"" Allen said Friday. The commander accused of Omar of sending ""young brainwashed men to carry out attacks in a fruitless cause,"" while he ""rests comfortably from afar."" ""He professes love for his fighters, yet he sends them to their deaths by the hundreds. Where is the vision that Omar speaks of? Where is the love he professes for the Afghan people?"" Allen said. ""Are these not the acts of a deranged man who puts his own goals of personal domination ahead of the future of the Afghan people?"" Shootings by Afghan forces take growing toll on NATO troops . An estimated 101 NATO troops have been killed in green-on-blue attacks since May 2007 across the country, military analyst Bill Roggio said Friday. Roggio, managing editor of the Long War Journal blog, which reports and analyzes terror issues, said green-on-blue attacks have caused around 13% of coalition deaths this year. Of the green-on-blue attacks since 2007, about 40% of the deaths have occurred this year and 35% occurred last year, he said. Roggio said there was a flurry of insider attacks early in the year, then a lull, and now a flareup in recent days. Green-on-blue is military lingo, with green a reference to Afghan forces and blue to coalition troops. "" 'Blue' is always the color of the friendly force, i.e. NATO/ISAF; 'Red' signifies the enemy force; and 'Green' is the indigenous force allied with, but separate to, the friendly force. In this case, 'Green' is the ANSF,"" said Maj. Adam Wojack, a media officer with the International Security Assistance Force, referring to the Afghan National Security Forces. The U.S. military is starting to use the term ""insider attack"" rather than ""green-on-blue"" because it's easier to understand and because Afghan troops have been victims of the attacks. The NATO-led command did not provide details about the deadly attack in Farah, but a provincial police chief told CNN that an Afghan policeman shot the American service members early Friday during a training session in the Bala Boluk district. Police Chief Aqa Noor Kintos said two U.S. Special Forces members were killed and another was injured. The gunman was killed when troops returned fire, he said. During the gunfight, an Afghan National Police member was also killed, and another was injured, he said. Lt. Col. Hagen Messer, a NATO-led command spokesman, confirmed that two U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Taliban claimed responsibility in a text message to journalists, saying a 70-year-old policeman killed the three troops. It's the second time a man in an Afghan security uniform has opened fire on coalition troops in the Bala Boluk district. In December 2011, a gunman posing as an Afghan soldier wounded coalition troops. Official: Man in Afghan security uniform kills 3 U.S. troops . In the Kandahar incident, the member of the Afghan National Army who turned his weapon against coalition forces was shot and later died of his wounds after he was taken to an ISAF medical facility. The incident occurred in the province's Zharay district, ISAF said. The frequency of the insider attacks has prompted Afghan intelligence agents to go undercover during recruit training to spot possible extremists, military officials said. Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force. The U.S. government has offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of Omar, who took over Afghanistan in the early 1990s and established a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. Omar vanished from public view after a U.S.-led coalition ousted the Taliban and its leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. Over the years, he has refused to be photographed or filmed, and has rarely traveled. As a result, Omar's appearance has remained a mystery to many. Those who have met Omar say he has one eye stitched shut, the result of a wound suffered during a battle with Soviet troops during their occupation of Afghanistan. There have been conflicting reports about Omar's fate. As late as last year, the Taliban denied reports the leader was dead. The attacks come a day after a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan killed seven U.S. service members, three Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. Authorities are investigating whether the crash was caused by technical problems or a shoot-down.","NATO official's order was made in recent days as concern mounted over the attacks .

"(CNN) -- Titleholders Inter Milan will take on Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League after Friday's draw produced a repeat of last season's final. Italian side Inter went into the pot knowing that a tie with one of Europe's top sides was likely after qualifying for the knockout stages in second place in Group A behind Tottenham. ""It's an interesting draw,"" Inter chairman Massimo Moratti told the club's official website. ""We've faced Bayern Munich lots of times in the past, it's almost a traditional fixture."" Rafael Benitez's side will have home advantage for the first leg, which will be played in February, while the trip to Germany will take place in March. Bayern, beaten 2-0 in May's final when Jose Mourinho was in charge of Inter, have struggled in the Bundesliga but topped Group E with five wins from six matches. ""Inter is an extremely tough draw. Probably the most difficult draw open to us,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told the club's website. ""But it's also a very appealing draw for us. This is now our chance to take revenge."" Barcelona will play English club Arsenal in a repeat of the 2006 final and last season's quarterfinals, both of which were won by the Spanish champions. ""Difficult but possible,"" was Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's reaction to the draw. ""I didn't want anybody really, all teams would have been difficult,"" he told his club's official website. ""Barcelona are certainly the favorites but they did not want us either because they know they will get a game."" Barca's Spanish rivals Real Madrid have the chance to avenge last season's second-round defeat by French club Lyon, who went on to reach the semifinals. Mourinho will seek to take his expensively-assembled team past the last-16 stage for the first time since 2004 as Real bid for a 10th title. Madrid legend Emilio Butragueno, who was present at the draw, believes his former club will reach the later stages of the competition this year. ""This is a cruel but thrilling competition. We drew Lyon and must accept it,"" he said on Real's website. ""We must be very focused. We are more than capable of making the quarterfinals."" English club Tottenham's reward for finishing top in Group A in their first appearance in the competition is another trip to Italy to face AC Milan. The Serie A leaders, who finished second behind Real in Group G, are seeking an eighth title, having last won it in 2007. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp described the match as a ""great challenge."" ""I said before the draw that I wouldn't mind playing AC Milan,"" he told the London side's website. ""You want to take on the best teams in the world, and that's what the fans want to see as well."" Three-time champions Manchester United will travel to France next month for the first leg against 1993 winners Marseille. Manager Alex Ferguson told the United website it would be a ""difficult tie"". ""Marseille are a handful at their own ground, their fantastic atmosphere and incredible support guarantees that. They've had a good change in fortunes in the last two or three years,"" he said. English rivals Chelsea, who also topped their group, will face Copenhagen -- the first Danish team to reach the knockout stages after finishing second in Group D behind Barcelona. But Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said the Premier League champions would not underestimate their opponents. ""'There's no easy games at this stage and we'll be very careful,"" he told the club's website. Shakhtar Donetsk will also face a last-16 tie for the first time after topping Group H ahead of Arsenal, and the Ukrainian side will travel to the Italian capital to play AS Roma in next month's first leg.

"(CNN) -- Two weeks before Nelson Mandela's 93rd birthday on July 18, actress Alfre Woodard sits on a couch near her home in Santa Monica, California, reminiscing about the first time she met him. Already an activist and a leading voice against apartheid, Woodard introduced Mandela at a fundraising event in 1990 during his first trip to the United States after his release from prison. ""By the time I got on stage, I literally started to hop around ... I could not stop the electricity in my body,"" she said. ""So I went and I wrapped my arms around him, and I said to him in his ear, 'Oh Madiba, Madiba. How are you? Have you eaten? Have you slept?' And it became a really funny thing because 'Nobody has asked me that, Alfre, in my entire travels,'"" Woodard said with a laugh. ""So that sort of became the basis of our relationship."" Long before they met, Woodard's passion for social justice in South Africa had been growing since she was a student at Boston University. By 1989, she joined a handful of artists and actors, such as Danny Glover and Mary Steenburgen, to found what is now called Artists for a New South Africa (ANSA). They used their celebrity platform to shine a light on apartheid and lobby for sanctions against the regime. ""Once apartheid was crushed ... one of the things Madiba said to us was, 'You've helped us in our struggle to defeat apartheid, but right now we're facing another formidable foe -- and that is the HIV/AIDS pandemic,'"" she said. ""So we've morphed through the years of how we've wanted to be of assistance."" ANSA shifted its mission and in 2005 created an orphan care program called ""It Takes a Village"" to help around 3,500 AIDS orphans in South Africa. While working to combat the disease, Woodard's relationship with Mandela has grown both as an activist and a friend. She remembers receiving an invitation to a state dinner at the White House when Bill Clinton was president -- not from Clinton himself but from Mandela, who was being honored there. ""We were in the receiving line ... and he sees me about three people away and he leans over and he goes 'Alfre, Alfre! Remember me? It's Nelson,"" she said. ""And I said, 'Madiba, I don't think anybody will ever forget you and certainly not me."" Other times, their dinners were less formal. ""We continued to do political work together...and I'd always had the blessing and good fortune to be able to have a private meal with him. The first one was after he became president. ""The thing about Madiba is that immediately it's like having an audience with your ancestors ... because he recognizes you as a young person but he talks to you and expects things of you as an equal. And I think when people expect things of you, you realize that you're capable of it and you can do it."" During one of Woodard's trips to South Africa, she toured Robben Island, where Mandela spent many of his 27 years in prison. ""After hearing so much about it, it's this big, evil fortress that sucks the life out of good people ... I thought I would get there and be angry,"" she said. ""As Ahmed Kathrada [a South African politician who spent 18 years in prison on Robben Island] walked us through the cellblocks and talked about life there, he completely transformed the whole notion of imprisonment. I realized you could not be imprisoned. You can be held. But these men decided not to be in prison. And for me, it almost became a sacred place. ""I think what Madiba has demonstrated to all of us is not what he was capable of but what every single person is capable of ... it doesn't matter what circumstance you're put into. It's how you respond to circumstance. ""He gives us that not as an icon but as a human being, as a man, as a grandfather, as a father, as a person, as a Madiba to everybody.""","Alfre Woodard greeted Mandela on his first trip to the U.S. after his release from prison .

"(CNN) -- One after the other, dozens of cars and trucks slammed into the back of a multicar crash in Massachusetts until about 70 vehicles had been wrecked and at least 35 people had been taken to hospitals, the Massachusetts State Police said Sunday. Two people were seriously injured, Sgt. Stephen Marsh told reporters. The accidents began before dawn on icy Highway 290, Marsh said, and didn't stop until the chaos stretched 500 yards. Marsh said that as cars came over a rise, drivers saw the accidents and tried to brake but were caught up in the chain of collisions.

There were four commercial trucks and about 65 passenger vehicles involved. One of the cars that was rear-ended was a state trooper's cruiser, which was stopped at the site of one of the early crashes. Marsh said some of the cars were wedged under the tractor-trailers that turned sideways, blocking the roadway. The road, near Worcester, was closed for about five hours.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A coroner in Singapore has reaffirmed that American engineer Shane Todd committed suicide -- a ruling that caps a two-month investigation and is at odds with his family's contention that Todd was killed because of his work. Soon after Todd was found hanging from the bathroom door in his Singapore apartment on June 24, 2012, Singapore's medical examiner concluded he had killed himself. But Todd's parents disagreed and hired a pathologist in the United States who -- based on Singapore's autopsy report and photographs of the body -- suggested there was evidence that his death was a homicide. The latest ruling by the coroner sides with the medical examiner's assessment. ""The cause of the deceased's death was asphyxia due to hanging,"" the coroner's report said. ""There was no foul play involved in the deceased's death. The deceased had committed suicide by hanging himself."" In the report, released Monday, state Coroner Chay Yuen Fatt extended his condolences to Todd's family. ""I hope that the family will be able to find closure and I wish them all the best,"" the coroner said. Murdered for his work? The report is the end result of a 10-day hearing into the death last month. In it, Chay said Todd had ""entertained suicidal ideations of overall increasing severity"" in the months leading up to his death. The United States Embassy in Singapore said the inquiry was ""comprehensive, fair, and transparent."" ""The coroner heard testimony from a wide range of witnesses in open court and received evidence in the form of written statements and records,"" it said in a statement Monday. The decision is unlikely to appease Todd's family. CNN was unable to reach them for a reaction early Monday morning. Singaporean lawyers hired by the Todd family have suggested Singapore's police work was sloppy and that an assumption of suicide led police to neglect other evidence. During inquiry proceedings last month, the Todds' lawyers asserted a possible crime scene was altered: Todd's hanging body was cut down and laid on the floor and a nearby chair moved before a forensics team and photographer arrived. Police maintain this follows standard procedure. The 31-year-old Todd had been working for a year and a half at the Singapore government's Institute of Microelectronics (IME) when he decided to quit his job and return home to the United States. He was part of a team researching uses of Gallium Nitride (GaN), a semiconductor that can operate at extremely high temperatures. Documents found on Todd's laptop after his death reportedly indicate IME may have had plans with Chinese telecom giant Huawei to co-develop an amplifier using GaN. Such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses. Todd's parents believe their son may have been murdered over his knowledge of such a sensitive project. They say their son had warned them his life was in danger. Both IME and Huawei deny that any joint GaN project ever went forward. 'Burden to those around me' On the night of June 24, 2012, Todd's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento, a nurse, discovered his body. She had gone to the apartment after he didn't answer calls or texts. During the court proceedings, Sarmiento testified she didn't know the details of Todd's work but said Todd told her ""how much he hated"" it. On one occasion he told her he was ""working on something that could get him into trouble with the American government"" and that ""heavy hands"" were coming after him, though he didn't elaborate. But Todd had also confided in his girlfriend that he had been depressed since October 2011. But she said he ""did not display any suicidal tendencies."" On his laptop, authorities found a two-page suicide note. ""I am so sorry it has come to this but I feel I am just a burden to those around me. I have tried to get jobs in the U.S. but I know I am not capable of fulfilling the duties required of me,"" he said in one. What led to death? In his report, the coroner says Todd did not possess confidential information from his work at IME and the GaN project did not materialize. ""At the time of his death, the major stressor in the deceased's mind was unlikely to be his workload,"" the coroner said. Todd had already put in his 60-day notice to leave his job and his workload had decreased, . ""Why then would the deceased commit suicide before he was due to return to the US?"" Chay posed in the report. He then hazards some guesses. Todd was concerned he won't be able to get Defense Department clearance for a new job ""because of his perceived involvement in violating US security, the possibility,"" and about his psychiatric condition, Chay wrote. ""These concerns in all likelihood caused him to feel that his deep sense of failure (which was magnified by his psychiatric anxiety) would follow him back to the US,"" the coroner concluded. ""In the deceased's mind, all these factors eventually outweighed the happy prospects of reuniting with his family in the US and culminated in his ultimate decision to take his own life.""","NEW: U.S. Embassy says the inquiry was ""comprehensive, fair, and transparent.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The permanent council of the Organization of American States has approved a resolution asking troops to withdraw from the disputed border area between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. In a resolution issued early Saturday, the council said both nations should ""avoid deployments of the armed forces or security forces in the area where their presence could generate tensions."" Tensions between Nicaragua and Costa Rica have flared over Calero Island, a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast. Managua claims the area is Nicaraguan and denies its troops are in Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica claims it has been invaded. The resolution supported a report by OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza that said both sides should resume binational talks and not escalate the military and police presence near the disputed area. The council's Washington meeting was contentious, however, beginning Friday afternoon and lasting until early Saturday as diplomats tried to reach consensus. Ultimately, the resolution passed with 22 votes, the organization said in a statement. Three countries abstained and two voted against it. Denis Ronaldo Moncada, Nicaragua's ambassador to the Organization of American States, said early Saturday that officials from his country would challenge the resolution. ""In the end, an agreement was reached that is really without any value,"" he said. ""We are going to challenge this resolution. We are going to question it, and we are going to document our position against this resolution, which was flawed from the outset and flawed in its conclusion,"" he said. Costa Rican officials claimed the vote was a ""triumph of peace and law."" ""Now, more than ever, the Nicaraguan authorities must know to listen to the clamor of all of the hemisphere in favor of peace and peaceful relations between neighboring nations, and withdraw their armed forces from Costa Rican territory,"" Costa Rica's foreign ministry said in a statement. Costa Rica claims that in addition to the Nicaraguan troops, a dredging project in the river is dumping sediment on its side of the border, and that a Costa Rican flag in the area was replaced with a Nicaraguan flag. Nicaragua has accused Costa Rica of breaking diplomatic relations between the countries. Wednesday, Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla said her country would take its border dispute with Nicaragua to the . United Nations and the International Court of Justice if a resolution is not found. Chinchilla has said her country accepted the recommendations made by Insulza, but that before there are binational talks, the Nicaraguan troops must move back into undisputed Nicaraguan territory. If the Nicaraguan troops pull back from the disputed area, Chinchilla said she gives assurances that Costa Rican police will not move in. In response, Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo acknowledged that Costa Rica may have no standing army, but said that means little, given that members of the Costa Rican police are better armed than Nicaragua's soldiers. In an earlier interview with CNN en Espanol, he called on Costa Rica and Nicaragua ""to resolve this as brothers"" and ""for a ceasefire in the verbal war,"" but added that Nicaragua is not the aggressor. ""We cannot invade our own floor of our own house,"" he said. ""Neither can we accept from anyone conditions or ultimatums.""

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as the 44th president of the United States, the wish list that has been building abroad may have grown longer than he or anyone else can deliver. The world's newspapers marked Barack Obama's election win. Now, world governments want him to act. There are the apparently eternal conflicts of the Middle East and Kashmir, between India and Pakistan, that have already reared their ugly heads almost as a warning even before Obama took office. Between them, they engulf most of the grievances and violence that shape the Islamic world and its relations with the United States. Intense U.S. involvement will be needed to help resolve both of the conflicts. This will require imagination, creative out-of-the-box diplomacy, and the courage to see it through both from the United States and leaders on the ground. Going back even to the status-quo ante will no longer be sufficient. The 30-year-old rupture in relations between the United States and Iran is also expected to be addressed as a key priority by the new administration. Both the president-elect and his secretary of state-designate have said they want to abandon the silent treatment and isolation of previous administrations and try engaging Iran, as a way of resolving difficult issues such as its nuclear program and its influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Watch Amanpour talk about world views of Obama » . The United States remains bogged down in hot wars in both of those countries. While the Obama administration plans to increase troops and nation-building in Afghanistan, it is also signaling it will not give President Hamid Karzai's government the ""free ride"" he is thought to have received from the Bush administration. Karzai will be expected to root out corruption and better address the needs of the Afghan people. The new administration will also try to revive nuclear arms agreements that have been abandoned over the last eight years and try to forge a more constructive relationship with Russia, while persuading that country to meet its international obligations too. While many allies -- and adversaries -- welcome the new U.S. administration's declaration to use diplomacy and soft power, the question remains: Will Washington's allies also pull their weight in helping set their common agenda? Many nations and governments say they welcome America's vital global leadership, and the question at the start of the Obama administration is: Will they rise robustly to the occasion, and not just carp from the sidelines? While much is expected from Obama, much, too, will be expected from his allies.","World has long wish list for Barack Obama when he becomes president .

"(CNN) -- A last-ditch effort to put an end to the bloodshed in Syria failed on Saturday, with Russia and China exercising their veto at the United Nations. With that fateful decision, the conflict moved to another, more dangerous stage. Those who warn that Syria will descend into civil war are a bit behind: It is already in civil war. Now it will only intensify. In the months leading up to the U.N. vote, Syria's opposition has grown more militarized. Rebel forces, under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, gained considerable traction after a shaky start. The U.N.'s failure to act may have been the best recruiting tool the FSA could have hoped for, and its ascendancy is now a nearly foregone conclusion. Meanwhile, after first opposing any resort to armed resistance, the Syrian National Council, the country's most representative opposition body, has made an important shift. It has now ""pledged to support"" the FSA, and the two groups are attempting to increase coordination. Where does that leave the international community? The U.N.-endorsed norm of ""responsibility to protect"" (sometimes boiled down to ""r2p"") mandates a collective response when states wage war on their own populations. The Syrian regime, however, is making a mockery of the notion, with its brutal assault on the city of Homs just as the U.N. vote was taking place. Either the international community takes r2p seriously, or it doesn't. We have to decide. As I've argued before, military intervention remains premature. But, in light of recent events, the time has come to carefully consider the various military options available, determine their feasibility, and begin to judge whether they would cause more good than harm. Of course, no one should take such intervention lightly. But just as proponents of intervention must make their case for how the military option could ""work,"" opponents of intervention face a similar burden of explaining how staying the current course will work. If the opposition itself has chosen the military option -- and this seems increasingly the case -- then the question is this: Can a ragtag army of perhaps 10,000 Syrian rebels defeat an army that while, far from invincible, enjoys an overwhelming advantage in numbers, equipment and firepower? The opposition may have millions on their side, with Syrians continuing to protest en masse throughout the country. But it's difficult to see anything less than a disastrous stalemate without the international community helping to tip the balance. No one, to my knowledge, is advocating for an Iraq-style invasion with tens of thousands of American boots on the ground. The options being considered are far more limited -- funding and arming the Free Syria Army, establishing ""safe zones"" in the north and a targeted air mission to weaken the Syrian military's capabilities. To be sure, all of these are serious forms of military intervention, but bringing up the specter of Iraq can be misleading, just as it was in Libya. So we find ourselves in an odd but increasingly common situation, where Syrians themselves are more enthusiastic about foreign military intervention than Americans are. It is, in this sense, the reverse of Iraq, which was rightly seen by many as a tragic Western imposition. Here, it is Syrians themselves who are pleading for the international community to come to their aid. In December, the Syrian National Council ""formally endorsed"" foreign intervention. If they formally request military assistance -- presumably the next step -- we have a moral responsibility to take it seriously. Unless the Assad regime suddenly implodes -- a possibility, but an unlikely one -- this is the direction in which we are heading. The ""anti-imperialists"" will, as they often do, cry foul. This time, though, they will find themselves on the wrong side. None of the Western powers has come out in even tepid support of military intervention. Consumed by their own internal problems, this is not at all something they want. But it may be something the Syrian people need. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN)A Michigan man is accused of threatening to behead the police officer who put Eric Garner in a chokehold. Alvaro Eduardo Guzman-Telles, 29, said in a Facebook post in December he was ""going to personally kill and behead Daniel Pantaleo"" and that ""this is a written threat and has to be taken extremely seriously,"" the FBI alleges in a federal indictment. He was arrested last month and faces a charge of interstate transmission of threatening communications, according to the indictment. Pantaleo, a New York City police officer, put Garner in a chokehold while trying to arrest him last July on suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. Garner died after the encounter, but a grand jury declined in December to indict Pantaleo, sparking large demonstrations across the nation. Guzman-Telles also allegedly said on Facebook to ""kill all cops on sight. No matter the circumstances."" The New York office of the FBI tracked the social media posts back to an address in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where Guzman-Telles' mother was questioned. She said she was aware of the postings and told her son to delete them for she feared the posts would get him in trouble, the FBI said.","Beheading threat made on Facebook against cop at center of Eric Garner controversy .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- For a first-time candidate in one of the tightest and most closely watched Senate races, there may not be a better opportunity to raise your profile than a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention as an opening act for former President Bill Clinton . But that's where Elizabeth Warren stood on Wednesday night in Charlotte where she delivered a strident speech that brought a packed convention arena to its feet in thunderous appreciation. ""Americans are fighters. We are tough, resourceful and creative. If we have the chance to fight on a level playing field — where everyone pays a fair share and everyone has a real shot — then no one can stop us,"" Warren said. A Harvard law professor, Warren is challenging Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, for the seat he won in a 2010 special election to replace the late Democrat Ted Kennedy. It has been a tight race for the better part of a year, and Warren aimed key parts of her nationally televised address to Bay State voters. Warren was best known before her campaign as a watchdog of the government's corporate bailout program, a top financial adviser to President Barack Obama, and the force behind a high-profile agency borne from the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. CNN Fact Check: The $2,000 question ... She focused most of her convention appearance on the middle class, a major theme for Democrats at their convention and on the campaign trail. ""For many years now, our middle class has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered,"" she said. ""People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged."" While she didn't mention Brown in her speech, Warren went after the more conservative Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican opponent in November who she characterized as an uncompromising ally of Wall Street who would raise taxes on the middle class. ""Mitt Romney wants to give billions in breaks to big corporations — but he and Paul Ryan would pulverize financial reform, voucher-ize Medicare, and vaporize Obamacare,"" she said of the former Massachusetts governor and his running mate. Warren repeated a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail, taking aim at Romney's infamous statement that ""corporations are people."" ""No, Governor Romney,"" she said. ""Corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters."" Well under way for about a year, Warren's race is one of the most expensive Senate campaigns in the country. Since entering the contest, Warren has raised a massive $28 million, with Brown also taking in more than $19 million. The question now is whether her speech will give her a boost to put her ahead of Brown. When Warren entered the contest a year ago, she quickly rose to the ranks of widely known and beloved Democrats, having already been a target of congressional Republicans for taking on Wall Street, a key GOP constituency. Political observers have described the race as crucial for determining control of the Senate. Democrats hold a four-seat margin in the 100-seat chamber. Additionally, two Independents reliably caucus with Democrats. The Senate campaign has largely grown into a competition over which candidate is the toughest advocate for everyday people. Republicans, however, try to frame her as a liberal ideologue with little to no centrist appeal. Warren got big spotlight at the convention, while Brown has not tied himself so closely to his party. Brown didn't make a high-profile speech at last week's GOP convention and he is less than shy about asserting his independent spirit as a Republican in typically Democratic Massachusetts. He launched a website this week critical of Warren on taxes and other issues. Progressive group hits milestone in support of Warren . Obama sings high praises for Warren .

"(CNN) -- Over the past month, North Korea's 29-year-old leader, Kim Jong Un, has threatened to attack Washington with nuclear weapons, declared a state of war with neighboring South Korea and warned diplomats to evacuate the peninsula. The Obama administration has sent conflicting responses: first deploying bombers and new missile defense assets to the region, then appearing to back off and calling for dialogue with Pyongyang. This is a pattern the North has come to expect of all U.S. administrations. Historically, after major provocations, the United States has returned to the bargaining table with North Korea within, on average, five months of a provocation. And, of course, the North has typically cheated and raised further demands based on improved nuclear explosions and more capable missiles developed while leaders were in dialogue mode. We will not negotiate our way out of this one. On the other hand, sanctions and pressure have not deterred the North from its nuclear weapons path. Is the North Korea problem unsolvable? No. But U.S. policy must be based on realistic assessments of five factors: the North's intentions, the danger involved, the efficacy of dialogue, the approach to China, and the role of our alliances. 1) What does North Korea want? This answer should not be so hard to figure out. The North's highest national priority is the capability to threaten the United States, our Pacific bases and our allies with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. Almost nothing will knock it off this path. Do the leaders want respect, aid, lifting of sanctions and legitimacy? Of course: But the regime has determined that these come from owning nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The North's outrageous threats are designed to elicit compromise and restraint from the other powers in the region -- to frighten us away from imposing U.N. Security Council sanctions for the latest nuclear and missile tests. Pyongyang wants first to establish itself undeniably as the world's newest nuclear weapons power. The regime may then freeze one part of its program temporarily, or promise a moratorium to receive food, energy and money, but the pattern has been consistent in later breaking away from whatever agreement was reached. If nuclear weapons were just about deterring the United States, then a nonaggression pact or peace treaty might have some possibility. U.S. administrations, from those of Barack Obama to George H.W. Bush, have offered North Korea security assurances more than 33 times. But the regime needs these weapons to deter China, to keep its army loyal and to juxtapose its weapons status against rival South Korea's enormous successes on the international stage. In the regime's view, the weapons are indispensable to its survival. Opinion: North Korea endgame -- 3 scenarios . 2) What is the danger? North Korea can be deterred. The young Kim's use of nuclear weapons would destroy the regime. The North Koreans might have everything to lose, but we -- as rich and comfortable societies -- have much more to lose. That is the leverage the North seeks to exploit. Pyongyang's increasingly brazen threats could reflect the exuberance and inexperience of a young untested leader, but may also reflect the belief that threats can be made with greater impunity when backed by a handful of nuclear weapons. If the North is beginning to produce nuclear weapons not only from plutonium harvested from its Yongbyon reactor, but also from uranium, then it may soon be able to produce more than one nuclear device, if not weapon, a year. This could lead to even more dangerous threats and demands -- including a possible repeat of the threat to transfer nuclear know-how to other countries. The other danger stems from the North's brinkmanship strategy itself. For five decades, the North has mastered the art of manufacturing crises and then pulling back from the brink. A CSIS study found that within two months of a rupture in negotiations, North Korea ratchets up another crisis with a provocation -- only to be rewarded with regional powers' diplomacy efforts within five to six months. With increasing confidence in its nuclear and missile programs, will Pyongyang come closer to that line? Will Kim Jong Un feel pressure not to back down in order to prove his credentials as a marshall of the DPRK? Will he pick the wrong targets and invite a South Korean retaliatory strike? Nuclear weapons: Who has what? 3) The efficacy of dialogue . The history of this torrid cycle of crisis diplomacy suggests that sooner or later, the Obama administration will be back at the negotiating table to rent a temporary cessation of North Korean belligerence, just as previous administrations have done. But the definition of madness is to do the same thing over and over hoping that the outcome will be different. It won't. That is why the main track now has to be pressure. Not war, but serious and sustained pressure by all parties that constrains weapons development and proliferation. 4) The China calculus . Of course, sustained pressure is impossible without China's involvement. For the first time in years, there is reason to hope China may be more helpful. Beijing is clearly exasperated with the North. The new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, is more decisive than his predecessor. His new foreign policy team views Pyongyang with a jaundiced eye after years of mopping up the diplomatic messes. Even sacrosanct assumptions, such as the North's role as a vital strategic buffer for China, are being hotly debated in Beijing. But we should not expect China to coerce its troublesome client. Beijing remains preoccupied with maintaining stability. Xi cannot push through the economic package he hopes to table in the fall without support from regime conservatives, especially in the military, who favor the status quo on the Korean Peninsula. Party chieftains administering the Chinese provinces bordering North Korea are critical to meaningful enforcement of tightened sanctions, but they care more about the flourishing border trade and investment opportunities in the North than implementing the will of the U.N. Security Council. Such constraints make it difficult for the senior leadership to -- as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry put it last week -- ""bear down"" on Pyongyang. This means the United States must avoid the temptation to make cooperation on North Korea a litmus test for U.S.-China ties. Doing so will only stiffen Chinese resistance and result in disappointment and increased bilateral friction. It also risks increasing U.S. ownership of the problem at a time when we want China to do more. Instead, we need to persuade China to drop its parochial approach in favor of cooperation that is strategic, farsighted and genuine, and part of the overall framework of our long-term security relationship. We must convince China that North Korea's actions are creating what Beijing most fears â€” greater U.S. military presence in the region and enhanced trilateral cooperation with Japan and South Korea. North Korea's missile capabilities . 5) Allies matter . A failure to stop North Korea's nuclear programs will irreparably damage our alliances in Asia. Not so much because it will lead to a nuclear Japan or South Korea, but because it will raise doubts about U.S. staying power and ability to provide security to the region. Any U.S. outreach to China about development of a long-term strategy for Korea must be grounded in deep trilateral planning and coordination with America's allies, South Korea and Japan. Indeed, all eyes will be on the new South Korean President Park Geun-hye as she lays out her vision to President Obama when they meet next month. Her brain trust has talked about quietly reaching out to change Beijing's view of its strategic equities on the peninsula. This argument will be more persuasive only if it is grounded in unprecedented levels of U.S.-Japan-South Korea cooperation on missile defense, intelligence sharing, military exercises,and missile defense collaboration in response to the North Korean threat. The allies are key to deterring the North and motivating China -- and to our longer-term position in the region beyond this North Korean footnote in world history.","Writers: North Korea's priority is being able to threaten U.S. and allies with nuclear arms .

"London (CNN) -- The past few days in Ukraine have been marked by an escalation of street protests and ongoing clashes with riot police in the center of Kiev, as Ukrainians respond to new repressive laws adopted last week. The legislation seriously undermines the freedom of assembly, media, privacy and civil society. These laws constitute a crackdown on major democratic freedoms and offer a path to dictatorship. They criminalize defamation, introduce a label of ""foreign agents"" for foreign funded NGOs, enact jail terms for wearing masks and hard hats during the protest, and restrict the work of non-registered news agencies. In short they could seriously undermine the chances for free and fair presidential elections when they are held. The protests erupted two months ago against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych's foreign policy U-turn away from EU integration. Since then, his strategy has been to suppress and intimidate the media and political activists. In December, prominent journalist Tatiana Chornovol was attacked and badly beaten. The Ukrainian president's office condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Since then, four protesters have died amid ongoing clashes with police and dozens have been arrested -- and a Ukrainian Catholic Church spokesman told the National Catholic Reporter that the church's website had been compromised by cyber attacks via neighboring Russia. Instead of dialogue and compromise, President Yanukovych has chosen the hard line towards establishing dictatorial rule. His ruling Party of Regions, in cooperation with the Communist Party, passed the repressive laws, and the Ministry of Interior issued a decree allowing riot police to use force and weapons against the protesters. The Kiev court prohibited any demonstrations until March 8. Statements about the ""foreign instigated"" nature of the protests and the language of an ""external enemy"" have started to appear in the ruling party rhetoric. Yanukovych has also fired his long-standing head of presidential administration, Serhiy Liovochkin, who is believed to take a moderate position in proposing dialogue with the opposition and protesters. As of today his post is vacant. The expectations are that it could be filled by a hardliner. Groups of thugs and aggressive young men who support the government have further destabilized the situation. On Tuesday more than 500 of them were roaming the streets of Kiev. Any attempts by citizens to call in police forces to address this security issues were ignored. Such further escalations could be the plan of the elites to introduce marshal law and forbid any demonstrations. What can be seen in Ukraine is an attempt to create a criminal dictatorial rule in order to preserve the power of Yanukovych, as the chances of his political survival or a victory in free and fair elections in 2015 are slipping away. It is a dangerous strategy, which will be futile for three main reasons. First, the civic protest is strong and is spreading to the east and south of Ukraine. Each aggressive move on the side of the regime sparks more and more people on the streets. Independent opinion polls show that 50% of the population support the protest and 25% cent are ready to participate in it actively. Second, the charisma of Yanukovych is hardly matching the profile of the dictator. His recent addresses to the nation and pre-recorded closed meetings with Ukrainian media show his lack of confidence and evasion of talking about political crisis. Much less is he ready to face any open rally of his supporters. His popularity levels are at a record low. Even before the start of the protest they were only 14%, compared to 42% in 2010. Finally, Ukraine's economic model is not viable to support a dictatorship. The macroeconomic situation remains very fragile and the investment climate had deteriorated even before the political crisis. The coffers of the state are drained as illegal raids pushed businesses into a shadow economy. The $15 billion infusion from Russia will only help so much and these disbursements will be tied to conditionality, such as state asset sales. Earlier this month the World Bank pointed to endemic corruption, weak governance, limited access to finance and a lack of competition as serious obstacles to growth. All this dooms Yanukovych's aspirations for a dictatorial rule. He should face the reality of irreversible change and prevent a further escalation. The alternative is an unpredictable collapse of his rule, as the nation will reject a tight grip on freedom and democracy. READ: Clashes turn deadly for first time .

"(CNN) -- Calling for an airport screening process that maximizes security but cuts down on passenger hassles, the U.S. Travel Association on Wednesday recommended key changes to the current system. The group, along with a panel of experts, suggested creating a trusted traveler program that would allow fliers who volunteer certain information about themselves to go through less rigorous security before their flight. It also proposed allowing each traveler to check one bag without a fee to reduce the amount of luggage going through security checkpoints. ""We need to do better,"" said Jim Turner, a former ranking Democratic member of the House Homeland Security Committee and co-chairman of the panel, during a news conference in Washington. ""We owe it to the traveling public to make the system make more sense."" Traveler frustration with the current routine -- which includes the familiar rules about taking off shoes, going through a metal detector or full-body scan (or both) and facing the possibility of a pat down -- prompted the report, titled ""A Better Way,"" the U.S. Travel Association said. What are the chances Congress would approve any portion of the plan? It's very difficult to get action in this area, Turner admitted. But if implemented, the recommendations could shorten wait times at security checkpoints and allow the Transportation Security Administration to screen passengers based on risk, the report said. 'Shrink the haystack' Right now, ""everyone who checks in is treated as a potential terrorist,"" said Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and co-chairman of the panel. The group called it a ""one-size-fits-all solution"" in which children and the elderly can be pulled aside for extra screening. But having everyone go through the system isn't the way to eliminate risk, Ridge said. ""If you want to find a needle in a haystack, you shrink the haystack,"" he said. That's where the trusted traveler program would come in, designating some passengers as low-risk based on information such as a background check, employment history, lack of criminal record and other factors. Once travelers enroll in the program and their identity is confirmed at the airport with the help of biometric information, they would be subject to less security, Ridge said. The program should be extended to qualified international passengers, the panel recommends. The TSA screens more than 628 million airline passengers every year at U.S. airports, and the vast majority present little to no risk of committing an act of terrorism, TSA Administrator John Pistole said in a speech earlier this month. In response to Wednesday's report, TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said Pistole's vision for the future of airport security screening is ""one that is more risk-based and intelligence-driven, shifting away from a one-size-fits-all approach at checkpoints."" ""Last fall, [Pistole] directed the agency to explore ways to further develop this strategy, with plans to announce more details this year. We welcome dialogue with stakeholders and the traveling public as the process moves forward,"" he said. The bag problem . Meanwhile, the U.S. Travel Association report also sets its sights on baggage. Passengers are bringing more carry-ons onto flights to avoid paying checked-bag fees, which increases checkpoint congestion and requires the TSA to devote more resources to screen passenger bags, the report says. The solution? The Department of Transportation should require airlines to allow each passenger to check one bag as part of the base airfare, the panel recommends. Congress must improve the current system, said Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. There are economic considerations at stake as well, he said. Dow cited a 2010 survey by Consensus Research, which found that U.S. travelers would take an additional two to three flights per year if the hassles in security screening system were eliminated. The additional flights would add nearly $85 billion in consumer spending and 900,000 jobs to the American economy, the report said.","NEW: TSA welcomes ""dialogue with ... the traveling public"" on panel's recommendations .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of protestors took to the streets in Vietnam Sunday as territorial disputes escalated tensions between the communist state and its neighbor China. A rally which drew around a thousand protesters in Hanoi focused local ire on the Chinese embassy, while smaller protests in Danang and Ho Chi Minh City echoed the anti-Chinese sentiment emanating from the political capital. The demonstrations were sparked by what Vietnam says were intimidatory tactics involving China's deployment of a deep-sea drilling platform in disputed waters in the South China Sea. Vietnamese officials say Chinese military and civilian ships have been harassing their vessels near the Paracel Islands -- which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- since the previous Sunday, even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon. ""The Xisha (Paracel) Islands are China's inherent territory,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a briefing Monday. ""The Chinese company's normal operations fall within China's sovereignty. China ... has required the Vietnamese side to take all necessary measures to protect the safety and lawful rights of Chinese citizens and institutions in Vietnam."" While public protests are rare in Vietnam, where the one-party system is wary of public gatherings, there have been several anti-Chinese protests in recent years. That this weekend's actions went ahead unobstructed by police is seen as a sign that the government tacitly approves of the protests. ASEAN backdrop . The anti-Chinese demonstrations, which were boisterous but free of injury or other incident, came as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in neighboring Myanmar. The country's president, Thein Sein, said ""regional and global issues of great concern to ASEAN will be extensively discussed among ourselves,"" during opening remarks. He did not explicitly refer to the dispute, nor the protests that it had spawned. The summit's Foreign Ministerial Meeting sought to present a united front, releasing a statement that called on regional disputes to be resolved peacefully. ""The ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting focused on (the) South China Sea issue in which it sought an approval to address the territorial dispute peacefully and reasonably,"" Myanmar Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin told journalists. ""In this regard, the meeting released the statement. All ASEAN foreign ministers expressed their deep concern about South China Sea."" Disputes on multiple fronts . China continues to exert its territorial dominance across the South China Sea, with recent disputes with its neighbors causing tension in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan. Last week Chinese fishing boat and its 11 crew members were apprehended by Philippine authorities near the Spratly Islands, another disputed region in the South China Sea. Philippine officials say the boat was carrying a large number of endangered species and they seized the boat ""to uphold Philippine sovereign rights"" in the disputed waters. ""It's possible that an armed clash could occur, but not a full-fledged war. The situation with Vietnam is serious -- more serious than the situation with the Philippines,"" said M. Taylor Fravel, Associate Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""China has controlled the northern half of the Paracel Islands since the 1950s and the southern half since 1974. Unlike the Spratly Islands, China maintains that no dispute exists over the Paracels. So we can see that China believes that its claim there is quite strong,"" he added. Exclusion zone . Relations between China and Vietnam soured on Friday, when a Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands. The oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, is owned by state gas and oil company CNOOC. The Maritime Safety Administration of China (MSAC) declared a three-mile exclusion zone around the rig, while military vessels have been deployed to patrol the area. ""At present, the number of escorting ships of China has reached 60, including military ships,"" Tran Duy Hai, Vice Chair of Vietnam's National Boundary Commission, said in a statement Wednesday. ""These vessels have intentionally hit and collided with Vietnamese law enforcement ships, including those of the Maritime Police and Fisheries Control, causing damage in human and property."" (sic) China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blame the Vietnamese for provoking conflict. ""The drilling activities of this rig are within China's territorial waters. The harassment by the Vietnamese side is in violation of China's sovereign rights,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She did not confirm the boat collisions. According to CNOOC, a third of China's oil and gas resources are under the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its own, refuting rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. 'Undermines peace' In Washington, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki condemned China's drilling near the Paracels. ""This unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region,"" said Psaki. China's Hua hit back saying that Chinese drilling activities ""have nothing to do with Vietnam, let alone the U.S."" Meanwhile, the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs said it will deal with the detained fishermen ""in a just, humane and expeditious manner."" Philippines police claimed the fishing boat was loaded with 350 endangered turtles when it was seized near an area it controls called Half Moon Shoal. China urged Manila to ""stop taking further provocative actions."" ""It is possible that the Philippines may have been emboldened by the recent defense agreement reached with the United States. China and the Philippines are jostling for control of the waters in the area where the arrest occurred,"" said MIT's Fravel. The arrests follow U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the Philippines earlier this week, kicking off the annual military drills held jointly by U.S. and Filipino forces. During the trip, the U.S. and Philippines signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, a 10-year security pact that gives the U.S. more military access in the region.

"BUZZARDS BAY, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- A crew member aboard a freighter seized by pirates off east  Africa said Wednesday that the crew had captured one of four pirates who hijacked their vessel, but they released him in a failed hostage trade. Shane Murphy is one of the crew members on board the U.S. ship that was hijacked off Somalia's coast. The crew of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama had hoped their release of the pirate would lead the pirates to release Capt. Richard Phillips, but it did not, crew member Ken Quinn told CNN in a satellite telephone call. Instead, the four pirates -- who had scuttled their boat when they boarded the ship armed with AK-47s -- took Phillips with them aboard the ship's 28-foot lifeboat, Quinn said. The crew had earlier overpowered the pirates and forced them off the ship, according to messages from first officer Shane Murphy. Murphy relayed the information in quick phone calls to his wife and father in his home state of Massachusetts -- where his father, Joe Murphy, is a maritime instructor, and his son once lectured about dealing with hostage situations.  Watch Shane Murphy's wife recall the conversation » . Joe Murphy, who teaches at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the crew sent a distress signal to which the U.S. Navy responded immediately from almost 200 miles away. The ship had eluded the pirates for more than three hours off the coast of Somalia before being boarded, Joe Murphy said his son reported. After hiding from their attackers, then leading them to believe they were more in command of the situation than they really were, the crew jumped the pirates, capturing one of them, the elder Murphy said his son told him. ""It was by sheer force,"" he said. ""They have no weapons -- it must have been, obviously, that they overpowered them."" He said three other pirates ""had gone into the water."" Pentagon officials confirmed that four hijackers had boarded the Maersk Alabama Wednesday morning, and that one had been in custody. Joe Murphy said his son was in contact with the pirates Wednesday evening, helping negotiate for the release of the captain. He said he can only shake his head at the timing of the attack. Two weeks ago, Shane Murphy visited his father's class to lecture the students on situations like the one he now faces. ""This is a classic example of Murphy's law,"" Joe Murphy said. ""I teach the course, my son goes to sea and he gets captured."" He said that, despite his concerns, he has faith that his son's experience and knowledge will help wrap up the tense situation. ""Hopefully, it's all going to work out,"" he said. ""I think this is going to end as a very positive story.""

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is still believed to be at his residence in Sharm el-Sheikh, will be brought to Cairo next week for questioning in his corruption case, said Mustafa Bakri, a former member of parliament. Bakri, who brought the case against Mubarak and other officials, was told of the development by the Prosecutor General's office on Thursday. Attorney General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud issued an order freezing assets of Mubarak and his family on Monday and prohibited them from leaving the country. Meanwhile, Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik has submitted his resignation and the Egyptian military has appointed former transport minister Essam Sharaf to the post, the military's Facebook page said Thursday. Bakri, a member of Egypt's parliament who lost his seat after filing corruption cases against various officials, provided documents indicating Mubarak's family has secret bank accounts totaling more than 200 million Egyptian pounds ($147 million), according to EgyNews. ""I submitted the corruption documents on Sunday night and on Monday morning I was called in by the public prosecutor for investigation, and he asked me to rush to his office."" Bakri told CNN. ""The attorney general, himself, went over the documents in my possession and then issued his orders to bar Mubarak and his family from travelling and to impound their assets."" Mahmoud ordered the freeze for property owned by Mubarak, his wife Suzanne, his two sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and their wives and children, EgyNews reported. The seizures include ""movable properties, real estate, stocks, bonds and various financial assets."" It wasn't immediately clear how the order differed from a similar one reported last week. Mubarak, through his attorneys and in official filings, has described reports of immense wealth as ""fabrications and baseless rumors."" But Bakri said the documents he provided to Mahmoud ""are the first solid and concrete evidence on the fortune collected illegally by Mubarak and his family."" Mubarak resigned February 11 after 18 days of protest against his rule. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","Egypt's attorney general freezes former president's assets this week .

"(CNN) -- When makers of one of the most anticipated video games of the year invited users to help design part of the game, the gamers jumped at the chance to create animated characters. Users will have the option to incorporate other people's ""Spore"" designs or choose to block them all. But some took it upon themselves to create something entirely different: a new kind of Internet porn. It started when the makers of ""Spore"" released a Creature Creator program that allowed users to develop their own characters to drum up hype before the game's scheduled release in September. The game, a joint venture from ""Sims"" creator Will Wright and Electronic Arts, allows users to create a unique creature and then control its evolution from a single cell into a complex cultural civilization. Within 24 hours of the Creature Creator's release, gamers had gone creature-crazy, designing millions of critters that were all thrown into a database and shown on a YouTube channel for the public to see. But scrolling through the database -- past the three-legged sea horse, past the seven-eyed wildebeest and the half-motorcycle-half-pig -- revealed something many users didn't expect. Buried among the more wholesome attempts were two-legged dancing testicles, a ""giant breast monster"" and a four-legged ""phallic fornication machine,"" for starters.  Watch Bradshaw demonstrate the ""Creature Creator"" and ""Spore"" » . These naughty -- some would say obscene -- creations have spawned an Internet meme nicknamed ""Sporn,"" short for ""Spore"" porn. For EA, the developer of ""Spore,"" it's the downside to tapping into the booming user-generated content arena, which has made sites like YouTube, Flickr, MySpace, Facebook and Second Life so popular. These games and sites often allow people to create and host their own content in addition to creating cartoon personas, called avatars, for themselves. Many of the popular user-generated content sites have faced similar challenges in trying to control obscene material. In Second Life, users can read Slustler, a cyberporn magazine, or buy programs that allow them to have animated sex with other characters. ""Whether it's modeling clay, dolls or crayons, a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar,"" said Lucy Bradshaw, ""Spore's"" executive producer. Despite its ""Sporn"" issues, ""Spore"" is poised to become one of the most popular games because of its ability to let people tell their own story, rather than one mapped out for them, Bradshaw said. ""Rather than putting players in the shoes of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins, we're giving them the opportunity to be George Lucas or Peter Jackson, as they create their own universe from scratch,"" she said. But for every George Lucas and Peter Jackson, there's always a spoiler. Enter the Spornmaster, a 37-year-old Web developer who refused to give his name for this interview. He, like many others, has spent hours creating characters and turning them into sexual beings. ""It came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do,"" he said. The creatures are not just static. Users can create animated scenarios for the characters to engage in, some of which include sexually graphic acts. When EA got word of the Sporn creations, it began working with YouTube to pull them down. Players who repeatedly upload ""offensive content"" are warned, suspended and eventually banned, Bradshaw said. But the policing isn't restricted to EA and YouTube. Users also are able to flag and report content that they find offensive. That angered some content creators, who feel that they should be able to create whatever they want. ""It was a totally ridiculous overreaction,"" the 37-year-old Web developer said. ""I admit it is silly and juvenile, but I don't think there's anything perverted, vile or awful about it. If people find it offensive, they can simply not search for it online. No one is forcing anyone to see this content."" In response, he created a site to preserve as many of his naughty creations as possible. He said many other creators of Sporn have told him that they too were only joking around. But the Web developer and other Sporn creators have had their share of critics. On blogs and message boards, some have called these creators perverts. ""I consider this very similar to child pornography, at least to the extent of distributing the material to children,"" said 18-year-old Michael James from Calgary, Alberta. James said he has flagged about 10 of the ""disgusting"" creations. EA plans to make sure nobody sees the content if they don't want to, Bradshaw said. When playing ""Spore,"" users will be given three choices regarding people's creations: to receive no outside content, to receive content from buddies only or to receive all external content. Bradshaw hopes the sexual characters don't spoil ""Spore"" for everyone or get in the way of what she says is a revolutionary game. ""User-created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible,"" Bradshaw said. ""It also gives them a powerful emotional connection to the game, since they've created the world from scratch."" Miles Moffit, a gamer attending the University of Georgia who has created tons of ""clean"" characters on his own, is glad to know EA will be regulating what makes it into the game. Moffit is eagerly awaiting the game's September 7 release. And if by chance a Sporn character shows up in his virtual ""Spore"" world, he has a plan. ""My initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldn't show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it,"" Moffit said. ""Go ahead, create a walking phallus. See how long it lasts in the databases and galaxies of 'Spore.' ""","Creature Creator allows gamers to design characters for new ""Spore"" game .

"Zaanse Schans, Netherlands (CNN)Not far from Amsterdam is a living piece of Dutch history. The Zaanse Schans neighborhood celebrates the past as a working community whose roots can be traced back to the 17th century and it's one of the few places in the world where you can still find functioning traditional windmills. The Zaan region is among the oldest industrial areas in the world and in its heyday of the 17th and 18th centuries it was home to around 600 active windmills. At the Zaanse Schans, among its wooden barns, houses and museums, just 10 windmills are still in operation, grinding oil, spices and colorings. One of these historic windmills is ""De Kat,"" meaning ""The Cat,"" which uses wind power to create pigments for paint. The listed building has a rich history; first built between 1646 and 1696, the windmill survived a fire in 1782 and a body rebuild in the 1970s. Piet Kempenaar, the miller at De Kat, has been working with windmills for over 30 years. Every day he stands on the windmill's platform as millers have done for centuries, looking at the sky and feeling the power of the elements. ""You must have a special kind of feeling for this technology,"" Kempenaar says. Kempenaar has to pay close attention to the wind because it dictates the day's work. Each part of the mill, from the wings to the tail, can be adjusted and tweaked to make the most of the wind that day. ""Sometimes you hear a sound and it's a problem with a bearing. Sometimes you listen to the waves on the water and you say, 'oh boy the wind has changed direction.'"" De Kat is a fully functioning paint mill. When the wind is strong, it turns 3,000 kilogram granite stones which grind down limestone into a fine powder and pack it with pigments. ""The weight of the stones are enormous and powered by the cleanest energy in the world,"" Kempenaar says. ""The breeze of the Lord."" This natural process is nothing new; it goes back to the area's roots. ""The whole industrial revolution was born here,"" explains Kempenaar. ""It was all coming by Amsterdam, the main port of the world, the main port of Europe for 300 years, so many boats were arriving in the harbor of Amsterdam on the coast loaded with raw materials and needed an industrial process."" Windmills are a passion Kempenaar has had since he started his studies as a miller in 1978, and he'll continue to preserve this art for as long as the wind continues to blow -- and as long as the Zaanse Schans continue to preserve this reminder of the Dutch Golden Age.","Zaanse Schans, Netherlands is dotted with working windmill sites .

"(CNN) -- Chicana author Sandra Cisneros is perhaps best-known for her 1984 coming of age novel, ""The House on Mango Street,"" a story about a young Latina who leaves behind her barrio for a chance at a better life. The novel, also released in Spanish, has sold more than 4 million copies and is a considered a classic of Chicano literature. But not everyone is a fan, specifically the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona, which banned Cisneros' book in its suspension of its Mexican-American studies program. It still bewilders Cisneros and her fans: How can a character who spends most of her time at the library and shares her experiences with her mother and blind aunt offend a school district? Cisneros is on a national book tour this month for ""Have You Seen Marie?"" a tale about a woman's search for a cat who goes missing in the wake of her mother's death. It's a fable for grieving grown-ups, and at less than 100 pages, she hopes the book will be medicine for hearts broken from loss. California-based artist Ester Hernandez, known for her depiction of Latina and Chicana women through prints and pastels, represented the unique and colorful characters, all based on Cisneros' neighbors. They make up the quirky King William district of San Antonio, Texas, where the story is based. Cisneros tell us what inspired the tale, why she is planning a move to Mexico and how she feels about her famous book being banned. CNN: What inspired you to write ""Have You Seen Marie?"" Cisneros: I was working on the 25th anniversary tour of ""The House on Mango Street."" I wanted to make a small book that people could have or give to someone in a place of grief. My mother had just passed, but I still felt the need to create something. My friend and artist of the book, Ester Hernandez, had just lost her mother too, and I proposed that she join me, and she very reluctantly joined the project. CNN: What do you want your readers to take away after reading this book? Cisneros: I hope that they understand that when they are in a time of grief, there is something to be gained during the time, even though we tend to focus on what we've lost. But when you have your heart broken wide, you are also open to things of beauty as well as things of sadness. Once people are not here physically, the spiritual remains, we still connect, we can communicate, we can give and receive love and forgiveness. There is love after someone dies. CNN: Were you surprised to hear that ""The House on Mango Street"" was the list of banned books in Arizona? Have you ever considered yourself a controversial writer? Cisneros: Gosh, no! I don't think they read the books. They just eliminated the entire whole Mexican-American studies without thinking. It should be called American studies, and all the books should be re-introduced. Then there would be less of an uproar. The fact that there is a hyphen there tells you a lot about our times. And our whole relationship with Mexico, which has always been very controversial, especially now. CNN: There has been talk about you wanting to improve your Spanish; is that true? And por qué? Cisneros: What's always a challenge for me is that my Spanish is not the level of my English. Nor do I read in Spanish the way I read in English. I want my Spanish to be like that of a newscaster. ... That's a different kind of Spanish. I feel comfortable in Spanish, I chat like a parrot, but I don't have the confidence in Spanish that I do in English. I'm perfectly fine in the mercado, and I can make people laugh and tell a story, but my vocabulary is limited. For example, I don't know the Spanish word for ""contractor."" But I'm going to Mexico to live for a year! This is the first time I'm going to live there. I just need to be in an environment where all I hear is Spanish. CNN: There's a lot of debate of whether or not knowing Spanish makes you a ""less Latino."" How do you feel about that? Cisneros: It doesn't make you less. You are just missing out on one of your senses if you don't have the language. It's like not having any taste buds. You are missing out on the pleasure of Latino food. The more you speak more languages, the more you understand about yourself. It's like being blind. You aren't less of a person, but you're missing out on wonderful things. CNN: Finally, what you are reading right now? Cisneros: I'm read essays, poetry, fiction, art books and more all at the same time! On my various bookshelves in my home are: ""The Five Acts of Diego Leon: A Novel"" by Alex Espinoza; ""The Distance Between Us"" by Reyna Grande and ""What You See in the Dark"" by Manuel Munoz; ""I (Heart) Babylon, Tenochtitlan and Ysteléi"" by Richard Villegas Jr.; ""Slow Lightning"" by Eduardo Corral and ""Looking for The Gulf Motel"" by Richard Blanco.

"York and Leicester, England (CNN) -- A year ago, historians held their breath as archaeologist Jo Appleby painstakingly dusted centuries of dirt and debris from the curved spine and staved-in skull of a skeleton uncovered under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester. The story of the long-lost king buried beneath a car park made headlines around the world -- but 12 months on, excitement has given way to anger, as enthusiasts and experts argue over what should happen to Richard III's remains. The once-missing monarch -- best known as the Shakespearean villain accused of murdering his nephews, the Princes in the Tower, to take the throne -- faces one final battle before he can be left to rest in peace: the increasingly bitter fight over where his bones (minus his feet, lost at some point during the past 500 years) will be interred. The judge in the case, Mr. Justice Haddon-Cave has even gone so far as to plead with all concerned ""to avoid embarking on the (legal) Wars of the Roses, part two,"" warning that such legal wrangling would be ""unseemly, undignified and unedifying,"" and urging them to call in an independent panel of experts to rule on the burial. The original War of the Roses was a bloody civil war which divided England for decades, and eventually saw Richard's family, the Plantagenets, swept from power. While the experts who carried out the search for Richard III's remains are keen to see him reinterred in Leicester, others believe it was the medieval king's wish to be buried in York -- the city they claim was closest to his heart. English rules and regulations governing exhumations should mean that the decision is a straightforward one -- such bodies are usually reburied in the nearest consecrated ground to the archaeological dig site -- but in fact it is proving anything but, with the launch of legal action to try and halt the plans. Read more: Richard III had worms, scientists say . Those behind the project had always planned for any bodies they uncovered in their search for Leicester's long-lost Greyfriars Friary to be reburied at the city's cathedral, just a stone's throw away from the now-famous car park. Back then Richard Buckley, lead archaeologist on what he admits to initially thinking of as a ""harebrained scheme,"" told CNN how he had applied for a license to exhume any human remains with the words ""In the unlikely event that we find the remains of Richard III..."" But it is this very license that now finds itself at the center of a court battle between the authorities in Leicester and a group calling itself the Plantagenet Alliance, who say more thought should have gone into the reburial. The Alliance -- made up of people who claim to be distantly related to Richard III, and headed by Stephen Nicolay, his 17th great nephew -- objects to the lack of consultation over where the newly-rediscovered king's bones should be laid to rest. They say that given the remains' royal status, it should not be a simple case of ""finders keepers."" Instead, they believe that the location of the new grave should be up for discussion. ""What we're saying is that for a significant historical figure such as Richard III, his remains should be the subject of a broad consultation,"" explains Matthew Howarth, the lawyer representing the Alliance. ""All the interested parties should be able to have their say, state their case as to where the bones should be buried... It shouldn't be a closed decision."" Read more: New coffin mystery at Richard III site . The Alliance eventually wants to see the bones taken to York, a northern city packed to the gills with historic sites and, the group says, with links to Richard III. It is a plea backed up by others in the city. ""Richard was the last northern king,"" explains Paul Toy, of York's Richard III Museum. ""He had lots of estates and he was constantly moving around, but certainly he would identify himself as northern, and York was a city that was very close to his heart... He was very much part of the civic fabric."" By contrast, say the ""Yorkists,"" the ill-fated monarch had little or no connection to Leicester -- other than the fact he was slung into a hastily-dug grave there following his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Not true, say those in the Leicester camp. ""There's considerable historical evidence that Richard spent quite a lot of time at his castle here in Leicester,"" says the city's mayor, Peter Soulsby. ""It was from Leicester that he chose to ride out to what would prove to be his last battle, and it was to Leicester that he was returned, and where he was buried on the orders of the new king, Henry. ""And frankly, to be buried by royal command in a city is pretty powerful evidence that this is where he ought to remain."" Read more: Is this the face that launched 1,000 myths? Soulsby insists that the events of more recent times offer all the more reason for the monarch to be laid to rest in Leicester. ""Leicester's people have honored Richard for many generations: We have a King Richard's Road, a King Richard's School, we even have pubs called after King Richard. ""It's not just the history that compels us -- it is also the fact that it was the amazing skill of Leicester University's archaeologists that actually rediscovered the remains, and their incredible forensic work that confirmed they were the remains of King Richard. ""Leicester is where he's been for 500 years, and Leicester is where he deserves to be reburied, with proper ceremony, and in a tomb fit for a king."" Indeed, the city is speeding full-steam ahead with plans for a new tomb in the cathedral, where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last Plantagenet king, and for a visitor center on the site of the Greyfriars car park, telling the story of Richard's life, his death, and his rediscovery. The council has already bought an old school which is being turned into a museum, and it is clear that there is a commercial aspect to the battle for the bones, since whichever city they end up in is likely to see a tourism boost. Read more: Body found in car park is Richard III . Granting a judicial review of the case, Haddon-Cave noted that ""the benefit in terms of prestige and increased tourism... is obvious. It is said that the foot-fall at Leicester Cathedral has increased 20-fold since the discovery."" Sitting in a quiet corner of the Cathedral Close with his wife Julia, waiting for a tour to begin, Leicestershire local -- but Yorkshire native -- Peter Farnworth believes that's another reason why the bones should stay close to where they were found. ""York has oodles and oodles of tourist attractions,"" he explained. ""Leicester doesn't have many, and if it loses Richard, it will have one less."" The Plantagenet Alliance, though, insist that money has nothing to do with their case. ""My clients have no commercial interest in it,"" says Howarth. ""They won't gain out of any tourism, but they have a very strong view that Richard's links to the north of England, and to York in particular, mean that he should be buried here."" For Toy, it comes down to the question of what the king himself would have wanted. ""As far as we can tell, as far as we have any idea of where he wanted to be buried himself, it seems to be in York,"" he told CNN. ""There's a sense that Richard III is a king who has had a bad press -- an unfair bad press -- and that responding as far as we can to his known wishes would slightly even things up a bit.""

"A senior Republican staffer is resigning after her comments that the Obama daughters should ""try showing a little class"" caused a firestorm of criticism on social media this weekend. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep. Stephen Fincher, confirmed to CNN that she planned to resign Monday. She faced heavy backlash when she wrote a Thanksgiving-Day screed against the Obama daughters, as well as the President and first lady, on Facebook that quickly went viral across the web. In it, she scolded Malia and Sasha Obama, 16 and 13 years old, respectively, for what she said was their inappropriate outfits and their bored looks during Wednesday's turkey pardoning ceremony, which they attended alongside their father. ""Dear Sasha and Malia: I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play,"" Lauten wrote in the post. ""Then again, your mother and father don't respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter,"" she added. ""So I'm guessing you're coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department."" Lauten went on to tell them to ""stretch yourself...rise to the occasion"" and ""act like being in the White House matters to you."" ""Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don't make faces during televised, public events,"" she concluded. Hours later, after her comments picked up steam on social media, Lauten deleted it and wrote another post apologizing for her comments. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his briefing with reporters on Monday that while he was ""taken aback"" by her comments, he thought her apology was ""appropriate."" ""I was taken aback there was a political operative on Capitol Hill who did use the occastion of a Thanksgiving-themed event to criticize members of the First Family,"" Earnest said. ""I was a bit surprised by that. But I will say that she has posted an apology to her website, and I think that was an appropriate thing to do."" Neither Fincher nor his chief of staff, Jessica Carter, responded to requests for comment via email. But Lauten found few defenders this weekend, even drawing a rebuke from Republican National Committee Communications Director Sean Spicer via Twitter on Monday morning. ""Children, especially the first daughters, are off limits,"" he tweeted. Spicer was far more displeased, however, with the way the comments were covered by the media than he was with the comments themselves. ""While the comments were inappropriate and insensitive, the mainstream media's coverage of this story is appalling. In over 20 years in politics I have never seen 1 of the countless inappropriate comments by Democrats ever covered to a faction of this,"" Spicer added.","Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Twenty-four people, including eight children, were injured in an apparent gas explosion at a Harlem apartment building, the New York Fire Department said. The explosion blew out some of the windows in the five-story building. John Rodgers, a spokesman for New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said Sunday that four of the eight children were from the same family. The conditions of all those injured were not immediately known. One child was in critical condition and the three others were in serious condition, New York Fire Department Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said. All four had burn injuries. One of the injured is an infant. A firefighter was also injured, but was in stable condition Saturday evening. He apparently was struck by falling debris, Scoppetta said.   About 200 firefighters responded to the scene of the blast on West 119th Street in Harlem. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the five-floor building after the explosion. The 4 p.m. ET blast blew some of the building's windows out, according to firefighters.  Watch rescue workers tend to injured »   Although the blast was still under investigation, Scoppetta said the cause appeared to be a gas leak. New York police said the blast was at the rear of the structure. Residents who assisted in pulling the injured out of the building said some kind of restaurant was being operated on the bottom floor of the building. Scoppetta refused comment on those reports, citing the ongoing investigation. An emergency room worker at Harlem Hospital Center said the facility received five to six people from the explosion about 4:30 p.m., but would not provide an update on their conditions. The building, which has 20 apartments, was evacuated, as were apartment buildings on both sides, Scoppetta said. Building inspectors will examine them to determine their structural integrity.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 10 members of Pakistan's military were killed in a gun battle with Taliban militants at a naval base in the coastal city of Karachi, authorities said Monday. The clashes raged for hours after attackers with guns and grenades stormed the compound Sunday night. By Monday afternoon, the base had ""been cleared from the terrorists,"" a Pakistani navy spokesman said. In addition to the 10 dead, at least 15 other Pakistani troops were wounded in the fighting, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said. Investigators have found the bodies of three attackers and believe a fourth is buried in debris, he said. They suspect two militants escaped, he said, citing witness reports. The Pakistani Taliban said the attack at the Mehran naval air station was to avenge the killing of innocent civilians. The group's spokesman, Ihsan Ullah, told CNN on Monday that Pakistani security forces are carrying out those killings on the instruction of the United States in the name of a ""war on terror."" One of the attackers had detonated a suicide jacket, Malik said, and another one was found wearing an undetonated jacket. ""We have daily 9/11 in this country. You see how we are suffering,"" he said. ""And therefore, this is my appeal to the international community ... trust us, trust us, because this is a time we need you to support us morally."" Authorities said militants wielding rocket launchers, automatic weapons and hand grenades attacked the base about 11 p.m. Sunday. They used ladders to scale a wall at the back of the base and jumped into the compound, Malik said. Two witnesses -- Amjad Bashir and Talha Hashmi -- reported at least 10 explosions in the subsequent hours. Each blast was typically followed by a sustained exchange of gunfire, Hashmi said. He said that several of the explosions -- thought to be the result of two military aircraft and a fuel tank catching fire and releasing plumes of smoke -- were particularly large. The attackers destroyed two P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft sold by the United States to Pakistan, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. Six American contractors at the base during the attack moved to safety and were not injured, he said. The nation's military personnel responded with what an Malik called a ""major operation"" at the base, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Karachi's main airport. According to the Pakistani navy's website, the Mehran base ""is efficiently supporting day and night operational activities of all (naval aviation) squadrons."" A host of courses are also offered on its grounds, from helicopter and air navigation instruction to sea survival. The Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is separate from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda. Karachi, which is considered the main commercial hub of Pakistan, has seen a drastic increase in political, ethnic and religious violence in recent months. Just over three weeks ago, three people were killed and at least 20 were injured when a hand grenade exploded at a gambling club in the southern Pakistani city. The grenade was tossed into the club by one of two unidentified people riding past the facility on a motorbike, according to Javed Baloch, a senior police official in Karachi. The Taliban said it was behind an April 28 roadside bombing on a main road through Karachi that left at least five dead and 10 injured. Two days earlier, three were killed and more than 30 wounded when remote-controlled bombs detonated near two buses carrying Pakistani navy officials. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Stan Grant, Nasir Habib, Greg Botelho, Jack Maddox, Aliza Kassim and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","NEW: Pentagon spokesman: Two P-3C Orion aircraft are destroyed .

"(CNN)His voice, his posture and his threats are menacingly familiar. The black-clad ISIS militant shown in a video demanding a $200 million ransom to spare the lives of two Japanese citizens looks and sounds similar to the man who has appeared in at least five previous hostage videos. The knife-wielding masked man with a London accent, nicknamed ""Jihadi John,"" has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of American and British captives. ""You now have 72 hours to pressure your government in making a wise decision, by paying the $200 million to save the lives of your citizens,"" the man in the video that appeared Tuesday says in comments addressed to Japanese citizens. ""Otherwise, this knife will become your nightmare."" Q&A: Harsh realities of kidnappings, ransom . The amount of money is the same as that recently pledged by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in humanitarian aid to Middle East countries that are affected by ISIS' bloody campaign in Iraq and Syria. Japan believes the deadline arrives Friday at 12:50 a.m. ET. And Chief Cabinet Minister Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday the country will do its best to communicate with ISIS through a third-party nation. But mystery and confusion still surround the identity of Jihadi John. U.S. and British officials have said they believe they know who he is, but they haven't disclosed the information publicly. That could be because Western intelligence agencies believe they have more to gain from keeping quiet, says Aki Peritz, a former CIA officer. ""They can put pressure on his family, put pressure on his friends,"" he told CNN. ""Maybe they have a line to him. Maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to Syria who can identify him. However, if you publicly tell everybody who he is, his real identity, then maybe he'll go to ground and he'll disappear."" There had been reports that Jihadi John was injured in a bombing attack by the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition. But the video that appeared Tuesday would suggest, if it's really the same person, that he's alive and well enough to make a death threat accompanied by a demand for money. His apparent reappearance helps ISIS' slick propaganda machine, which is used by the extremist group to raise money and recruit followers. ""It shows them resilient -- that they're able to film this video with these Japanese hostages outside in broad daylight somewhere presumably in Syria,"" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Five months and roughly 2,000 airstrikes after ISIS' video of the killing of U.S. journalist James Foley, why does one of the West's most prominent tormentors appear to still be at liberty? U.S. and British military and intelligence officials declined to comment on the matter. Experts say the problem lies in the extreme difficulty of infiltrating commandos into Syria to reach Jihadi John. ""ISIS operates in what we call denied territory,"" said Cedric Leighton, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel.  ""And that means by definition, that it's very hard for our folks to get in there, it's very hard for them to actually lay eyes on target."" A mission by U.S. special operations forces in July failed to find Foley and other hostages in Syria. ""The attempt to rescue Mr. Foley is one of the things that has now made the White House very reluctant to act aggressively,"" said Tony Shaffer, a former U.S. intelligence operative, who directed special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A senior U.S. administration official, however, said the U.S. government is ""actively pursuing justice"" for the slayings of the hostages. ""The FBI has an open criminal investigation, and as you have seen, we will hold terrorists like this accountable, no matter how long it takes,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. ""For operational security reasons, we are not in a position to detail all of the steps we are undertaking."" Meanwhile, as ISIS' deadline draws nearer, the Japanese government has to decide how it will respond to the extremists' latest life-or-death ultimatum.","Western officials have said they believe they know the identity of ""Jihadi John""

"(CNN)FIFA presidential hopeful Luis Figo is selling, but can he tempt 209 football federations to buy into his campaign to topple Sepp Blatter? The Portuguese great outlined an eye catching $3.5 billion giveaway as he seeks to build a base to challenge Blatter in the May election. Figo's ""For Football Manifesto"" promised that 50% of FIFA's revenues -- $2.5 billion -- would be handed to the national associations over four years to help fund global grassroots football development. The former Barcelona and Real Madrid star also wants to redistribute $1 billion of FIFA's $1.5 billion reserves to the member associations. ""After many conversations with football leaders, one of the consistent themes fed back to me is the way FIFA currently distributes revenues to its member associations is very inefficient and ineffective -- especially for developing football across all associations,"" said Figo at a media conference to launch his campaign at Wembley Stadium. ""FIFA belongs to its member associations and it is only natural that FIFA's revenues and reserves are distributed back to them directly. ""The impact of my proposals would mean between $8m-$10m being distributed to each member association across a four-year period."" ""If done in the right way, with a clearly defined strategy that is centrally audited and monitored, this investment will radically enhance football opportunities for boys and girls and directly benefit all of FIFA's 209 Member Associations."" Having dealt with FIFA's finances, Figo faced questioning over his knowledge of the world governing body's executive committee members. Asked to name the 25 committee members he came up with four names -- haltingly. Moving on, Figo floated the idea of expanding the World Cup to 48 teams in a bid to include more countries outside of Europe. Currently there are 32 teams that compete in the international extravaganza but Figo believes an extra three or four days of play would allow more nations to be accommodated. ""By increasing the number of teams participating in the World Cup, we not only make sure that we include more countries from across the world, but also enable FIFA to raise significant increased revenues that can be used to invest in the growth of the game globally. As for the game itself he wants to put an end to ""triple punishments,"" trial out sin bins for unsporting behavior, and revert to the old offside rule -- where players are judged offside whether directly involved in play or not. Ethical issues arguably have been a bit of minefield for FIFA in recent years and Figo pledged to ""lead by example, with the highest ethical and moral standards."" He's up against Jordanian Prince Ali Bin-Al Hussein who is using the same campaign company -- Vero Communications -- which also works for UEFA, the European confederation within FIFA. ""All I can say is thank God in my life I have had a successful career... I can stand on my own two feet,"" said Figo, who is funding his campaign out of his own pocket.","Luis Figo plans to give national and member states $3.5 billion of FIFA's funds to help grassroots developments .

The beaches remain open. ""Oil in the water is being skimmed and any balls that reach the beach are being removed as quickly as possible,"" the bureau's website said Thursday. iReport: See photos from Okaloosa Island . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of Northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. ""There have been no reports of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill-related oil products reaching the shore beyond the Northwest Florida region,"" Visit Florida's website said. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former Iranian president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was sentenced to six months in prison for making anti-government statements, semi-official Mehr News Agency reported Tuesday. Hashemi was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests, and the announcement of her sentence comes as parliamentary elections near. Her father, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is a powerful cleric and former parliament speaker. In the past, Rafsanjani has been one of the government's most vocal critics. Rafsanjani served two terms as president from 1989 to 1997, and is still widely believed to be one of the wealthiest and most politically powerful men in Iran. He had long been a staunch critic and bitter political rival of Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Weeks after the 2009 elections, Rafsanjani condemned the regime's violent crackdown against the opposition movement and spoke out for the people's right to peacefully protest in a speech delivered at Tehran's Friday prayers. In recent months, Rafsanjani had toned down attacks and made statements of apparent support of the regime and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Last March, Rafsanjani was replaced as head of Iran's Assembly of Experts, a powerful committee charged with electing and removing the leader of the Islamic Revolution and supervising his activities.","Faezeh Hashemi was arrested last year for taking part in anti-government protests .

"A crying mother cradles and moves her dead baby to the floor, yelling out, ""My child, my child."" Outside, another woman shakes and gestures in a fit of absolute grief as she piercingly screams, ""Pray to God and his prophet sister."" Both women had brought their children to a clinic in a rebel-held part of northwestern Syria, hoping to help save their lives. Instead, at least 15 children -- all under the age of 2 -- died after receiving measles vaccinations through a U.N.-sponsored program. As many as 50 other children got sick after what a U.N. report described as a ""bungled immunization."" So how did it happen? Syria's foreign ministry blames ""this catastrophe (on) leaders of the armed terrorist organizations"" -- a term President Bashar al-Assad's government uses for rebel groups -- ""and their supporters ... the Turkish authorities,"" according to a report from the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). In a joint statement, the World Health Organization and UNICEF said Wednesday that the groups' vaccination program in Idlib and Deir Ezzor provinces has been halted as a team of experts try to get to the bottom of the situation. A spokesman for the WHO, the public health arm of the United Nations, said a preliminary investigation suggests the deaths can be attributed not to a criminal act but simple human error. The WHO spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, said early reports suggest medics may have accidentally mixed a high-dose muscle relaxant into the vaccine powder instead of the designated serum. ""Apparently, in the same fridge ... where the vaccines were stored, there was also a muscle relaxant,"" Lindmeier explained Thursday to CNN, adding the vaccine itself likely wasn't contaminated. ""The muscle relaxant vial looks like the same vial as the vaccine."" This explanation may not do much right now to blunt the agony and anger of those who saw children die this week in Syria's Idlib province. Some distressed parents and local authorities have demanded not only an investigation, but that the medical personnel involved be put on trial, according to Mohamad Alkanash, an anti-Assad activist in the town of Jarjanaz. The Syrian government sent letters to the United Nations describing the incident as ""an ugly crime"" and claiming the children were given ""rotten, spoiled and poisoned vaccines,"" SANA reported. Notably, the vaccinations were administered in areas that the Damascus-based central government doesn't control, and therefore may not have direct knowledge of. And therein lies a larger issue: Syria's years-long civil war has caused number of humanitarian crises, including related to the spread of infectious diseases -- including ones, like measles, that can be tackled through immunizations. There's widespread violence and very little functioning government in some areas, leaving people young and old at risk. In December 2012, the WHO and UNICEF announced they would work with Syria's health ministry to distribute at least 1.5 million doses of measles vaccine in government-controlled areas. Still, hundreds of thousands of others are in areas not controlled by al-Assad's government. Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medicins San Frontieres, noted in June 2013 that at least 7,000 people had been infected in a measles epidemic in northern Syria. This is why U.N. organizations stepped in, hoping to address a dire need through vaccinations. Yet no one imagined the scenes that unfolded this week in Jarjanaz. Ali Abouel Majd, another anti-Assad activist, described one child dying in front of him. ""The child slowly ran out of breath before my eyes,"" Majd recalled. ""Doctors rushed to save some (children) and placed oxygen masks on their faces."" While the vaccination program may be stopped for now, that doesn't mean it won't someday resume. Lindmeier, the WHO spokesman, said that there are ""strong guidelines"" in place to avoid a situation like this one, ""but we cannot avoid 100% of human error."" ""The major challenge,"" Lindmeier said, ""is to make sure this campaign can continue safely.""","U.N.: Children die, at least 50 sickened after ""bungled immunization"" in northern Syria .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has blazed a trail in Formula One's history books by becoming the youngest double world champion, but his Red Bull team bosses are already looking for their next star driver. The all-conquering Austrian marque, along with the 11 other teams on the F1 grid, are in Abu Dhabi for three days of testing with some of the brightest young talents in motorsport. Having remained at the Yas Marina Circuit following Sunday's grand prix, which was won by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, the teams will put a number of potential future world champions through their paces between Tuesday and Thursday. Champion Vettel toasts dream year . One such prospect is Jean-Eric Vergne, the 21-year-old Toro Rosso test driver who finished second in the 2011 Formula Renault 3.5 series and has been given the chance to drive Red Bull's imperious RB7 car. Despite having an unfamiliar name at the wheel, the results on Tuesday bore an uncanny resemblance to those which have been witnessed in the sport for the last two years. Red Bull once again left the other teams trailing in their wake, only this time it was French youngster Vergne leading the field -- his lap of one minute 40.011 seconds beating Ferrari test driver Jules Bianchi into second place. ""That was a fantastic day for me,"" Vergne, who will drive for Red Bull on all three days, told the sport's official website. ""Driving the world championship-winning car is just great and I liked every lap I did out there. Latest F1 standings after Abu Dhabi GP . Bianchi has been handed the chance to take to the track for legendary Italian marque Ferrari at the test event for the second year in a row. ""It's great to be back at the wheel of a Ferrari on a real track,"" the 22-year-old said. The Frenchman also races for Lotus ART in the GP2 Series, where he has ended the season third after one victory and five podium finishes. The GP2 Series has long been a production line for F1 talent, with the competition having been the brainchild of former Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone and one-time Renault boss Flavio Briatore. ""I've already driven this car for some aerodynamic testing, but doing it at a real test is a whole different story,"" Bianchi said. ""Now, I am looking forward to a further two days of testing and we hope to carry on as we have started, with a lot of kilometers completed and trouble-free running."" Venezuela's Rodolfo Gonzalez is another GP2 graduate being given his chance to shine, taking to the cockpit for the CNN-sponsored Team Lotus on Tuesday. The 25-year-old hopes to emulate compatriot and Williams driver Pastor Maldonado in moving from the GP2 Asia Series to become the fifth driver from the South American country to compete in F1. ""It's my dream to drive in Formula One so I'm really very thankful for this opportunity,"" said Gonzalez. ""I think I've showed I have potential with the lap times I did, and am pleased with my times overall. ""I've proved I can do the job and have really enjoyed this experience in the car and learned a lot for my future. ""Knowing there are two more days still to do, just makes me smile more. It's a great opportunity ... I'm trying to learn as much as possible and get as much as possible out of it."" British team Williams are running GP3 champion Valtteri Bottas of Finland and Formula Two titleholder Mirko Bortolotti of Italy. ""I really enjoyed my first time driving the car on a proper track today,"" the 22-year-old Bottas said. ""It didn't take too long to get used to the car but there were still a few new things for me. There is much more downforce and power than the cars I am used to driving, but I really liked it and I think the day went well.""","The 12 Formula One teams are testing young drivers in Abu Dhabi .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Growing levels of conflict, terrorism, and the toppling of regimes in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as political violence in East Africa, are driving a rise in political instability worldwide, according to research by UK risk analysis firm, Maplecroft released on Thursday. Since 2010, one in ten of the countries surveyed have experienced a significant increase in the level of short-term political risk. These risks include governments asserting control over natural resources, regimes being ousted by popular uprisings and the expropriation of foreign investors' assets. The findings form part of the latest Maplecroft Political Risk Atlas, which uses 52 indicators to help companies monitor political issues affecting the business environment in 197 countries. Since 2010, Syria has deteriorated the most. It now ranks second compared with a 44th place ranking in 2010. Somalia topped the rankings. Afghanistan, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo also ranked in the top five. Egypt has been downgraded to ""extreme risk"" for the first time as a result of violence following the ousting of former President Mohamed Morsy and an increase in terrorist attacks in the Sinai Peninsula, the report said. Maplecroft warned that Syria, Egypt and Libya are ""now so bad"" that they will be ""mired in exceptionally high levels of dynamic political risk for years to come."" A fall in political violence in the Philippines, India and Uganda has contributed to these countries experiencing the biggest reduction in short-term political risk over the past four years. Improvements in the level of governance has also helped to lower risk levels in Malaysia and Israel in the same period. Social unrest . The report said there is a higher chance for social unrest to exacerbate political instability in Bangladesh, Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. ""This is due to the erosion of democratic freedoms, increasing crackdowns on political position and the brutality by security forces towards protesters, compounded by rising food prices and worsening working conditions,"" Maplecroft said in a statement. Another concern for foreign investors is that there has been a major increase in oppression by governments worldwide. ""This erosion of political freedoms is central to driving the wider risk of unrest and instability in the medium- to long term,"" said Charlotte Ingham, senior political risk analyst at Maplecroft. In the short term, foreign investors face a heightened risk of becoming complicit with the actions of these oppressive regimes, which poses a threat to a company's reputation, the think tank said. Empowered youth . Instability increases as the gap grows between political freedoms and social gains, such as education and computer literacy among young people. In 2010, prior to the the Arab Spring, Libya, Tunisia, Iran, Syria and Egypt were among the countries with the biggest divide between political freedoms and social gains. Maplecroft predicts that the growing imbalance between social gains and political freedoms in Bahrain, Azerbaijan and South Africa will heighten the risk of instability in those countries in 2014 and beyond. Although China is categorized as ""extreme risk"" in Maplecroft's ranking of oppressive regimes, the speed of the country's governance reforms is likely to be sufficient to limit the chances of widespread social unrest that could lead to a ""jasmine"" revolution, according to the think tank. But China's increased scrutiny of foreign business practices has created compliance challenges for companies operating there, the report added. Maplecroft cautioned that Vietnam's crackdown on social media and freedom of speech amid growing opposition may undermine the stability of the government in the long term. Poland has experienced a significant increase in the level of political freedoms over the past four years, according to Maplecroft, and now displays a ""near perfect balance"" between the level of political freedoms and social gains, which reduces the likelihood of protests and disputes over labor conditions. Political violence . East African countries saw the biggest increase in the risk of political violence, including terrorism, poor governance, and regimes vulnerable to popular uprisings. Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan scored in the ""extreme risk"" category, while Kenya and Ethiopia are ""high risk."" Eritrea, Tanzania and Mozambique also saw a change in their risk category. Three years after the Arab Spring, more than 60% of countries in the Middle East and North Africa region have seen a significant rise in political violence, demonstrating the long-term political risks associated with forced regime change, the report said. In the West, the impact of the global financial crisis continues to be seen in high levels of unemployment and underemployment. This, combined with austerity measures, has contributed to growing inequality and stalling or declining living standards, according to Maplecroft. Political landscapes both in Europe and the United States have become increasingly fragmented and polarized as populist parties flourished in response to growing voter dissatisfaction with established political parties over these issues.","New research finds the Middle East and North Africa, and East Africa are political risk hotspots .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Novak Djokovic suffered a shock semifinal defeat to Fernando Verdasco on Saturday to end his hopes of avenging last year's loss to Rafael Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters title match. While Nadal moved a step closer to his sixth successive triumph at the opening event of the European claycourt season in Monaco with a 6-2 6-3 win over fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, world No. 2 Djokovic crashed to a 6-2 6-2 reverse against sixth seed Verdasco. ""I wasn't moving well, I wasn't feeling well on the court -- it was a bad day,"" Djokovic told reporters. Verdasco, who has not beaten his compatriot Nadal in nine encounters, needed little over an hour and a half to overcome the Serbian, who had returned to form this week after a disappointing time in his past two hardcourt events in the United States. ""I want to be the one to break Nadal's streak,"" Verdasco told reporters. ""I tried to use my forehand well against Djokovic and make him really play. This will be my first final in Monte Carlo and I'm really excited."" Nadal took only 76 minutes to reach his 49th final on the ATP Tour with a comfortable victory against 11th seed Ferrer. His last defeat at the Monte Carlo Country Club came as a 16-year-old against Guillermo Coria in 2003, and he has lost only six career matches out of 164 on his favored clay surface. Former world No. 1 Nadal has not won a tournament in 11 months after a year wrecked by injuries. But he now has the chance to equal the record of six Monte Carlo titles held by Englishman Reggie Doherty, who triumphed in 1897-99 and 1902-04. Nadal was happy to make it through to final after falling in the last four in his previous Masters events in Miami and Indian Wells. ""I'm playing very well, I had a very good match today. The last two games, I was a little bit more nervous than usual because I lost two semifinals in a row,"" he told reporters. ""But for the rest, I think I played a very, very complete match. It's great to start the clay season like this. I'm playing well and I'm very happy with my game.""","Fernando Verdasco stuns top seed Novak Djokovic 6-2 6-2 in Monte Carlo semifinals .

"(CNN) -- A theater company from South Sudan is translating Shakespeare into the local dialect for the first time, before performing the play at London's Globe Theatre. Six months after the birth of South Sudan as an independent nation, it is a country still trying to define its culture and national identity. The South Sudan Theatre Company (SSTC) is helping to develop that culture by performing Shakespeare's tragedy ""Cymbeline"" in Juba Arabic -- a language spoken widely in South Sudan. ""Shakespeare is a genius writer who wrote about humanity, about greed, jealousy, wars, power, love -- he really speaks to the whole world,"" said Derik Uya Alfred Ngbangu, the SSTC's director and producer. ""We want to do Cymbeline in a way that speaks to the South Sudanese -- in terms of the plot, the kind of conflict that exists here -- and make it our own thing,"" he added. Juba Arabic is a pidgin form of Arabic that takes its name from the South Sudanese capital of Juba. Although English has been named South Sudan's official language since the country's independence, Juba Arabic is still a lingua franca in much of South Sudan, says Ngbangu. The SSTC's production is part of the ""Globe to Globe"" Festival taking place at London's Shakespeare Globe Theatre from April. The SSTC will be one of 37 theater groups from around the world performing interpretations of Shakespeare plays in their local language. The SSTC has already begun adapting Cymbeline and translating it. ""We're looking to cut out unnecessary bits so that 10 actors can do it, instead of perhaps 18,"" said Ngbangu. ""We're looking to have a simplified, shortened text that can be performed in one and a half hours instead of three."" Actors will be drawn from two of South Sudan's established theater groups, the Kwoto Cultural Centre and the Skylark Dramatist Association, and will include graduates of the University of Juba's College of Arts, Music and Drama. Ngbangu says they plan to perform Cymbeline in Juba before taking it to London in May. They are are also looking to make changes to the original to make it more relevant to local audiences, such as using local names and costumes. The original Cymbeline is set against a backdrop of impending war between ancient Britain and ancient Rome, over the king of Britain's refusal to pay tribute to Rome; the SSTC is considering changing that to an impending conflict between south and north Sudan, fighting over oil. Sudan's real civil war between north and south raged for decades, claiming more than two million lives. But Ngbangu says theater survived those dark years of conflict. ""Theater has existed throughout the time of the civil war and difficulties,"" he said. ""War never stopped people coming together through arts -- whether music or drama or dance,"" he added. And he believes theater can help build South Sudan, celebrating the fledgling nation's cultural diversity. ""It is a very cheap art form compared to cinema and TV -- you can do it anywhere -- move it to the villages and contribute to their understanding of their environment, their struggles, you can do it in schools and teach young people how to do the right thing. ""Through theater we can send a lot of messages about unity, about respecting people, about coming together, about tolerance and civilization. He added: ""There is an old saying -- 'give me a theater and I will give you a nation.'"" As casting and rehearsals begin, Ngbangu is excited at the prospect of performing in London. ""I have been to London several times. It is a land of theater, a land that produced a giant like Shakespeare,"" he said. ""To be in London with a Shakespearean play, when we're a country that will be nine months old at the time, it's a great thing.""","South Sudan Theatre Company producing Shakespeare play ""Cymbeline"" in Juba Arabic .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel early Sunday released the names of the first group of Palestinian prisoners to be freed in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, setting in motion a process that will allow the public to file objections to specific releases. The list features 477 names, including those of Ahlam Tamimi, serving life terms for being an accomplice in a suicide bombing at a Jerusalem restaurant, and Amneh Muna, who plotted the killing of a 16-year-old Israeli boy in 2001 and received a life sentence. Israel approved the deal Tuesday night, agreeing to release in two stages 1,027 Palestinians prisoners, including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. The first swap is expected to take place early this week. Twenty-seven of the prisoners are women. The second stage, which includes 550 prisoners, will occur later this year. A spokesperson for Israeli President Shimon Peres said Saturday that the pardoning process formally commenced after a Justice Ministry official submitted the requisite paperwork. Peres will allocate 48 hours to complete the procedure in order to allow public objections and petitions against the pardons. Read the list (PDF) The president is expected to voice his discomfort with the release of convicted murderers, but is unlikely to reject any of the pardon requests, spokeswoman Ayelet Frish told CNN. Any changes to the list negotiated with Hamas could potentially endanger the entire deal, she said. The most notable name not in the list is jailed Palestinian lawmaker Marwan Barghouti, who is serving five life sentences. He was convicted in an Israeli court on murder and other charges related to his role in planning attacks on Israelis during the second Intifada. Shalit has been a recurring topic in the country's national dialogue. Militants captured him in June 2006 after tunneling into the Jewish state and attacking an Israeli army outpost. Israel immediately launched a military incursion into Gaza to rescue Shalit, then 19, but failed to free him. Since then, he has been held incommunicado by Hamas, which controls Gaza. Shalit's family has continuously petitioned Israeli government officials to broker a deal that would secure his release. ""Everyone wants to see Gilad Shalit safe and well and back home but I think there is a real failure to understand the price that is being paid, and the price is phenomenal,"" said Arnold Roth, who lost his daughter Malki in the Jerusalem suicide bombing in 2001. ""We are releasing people who have dedicated their lives to killing Jews and Israelis."" Roth opposes the announced release of Tamimi, who was sentenced to multiple life sentences for her involvement in the August 2001 bombing of a Sbarro pizza restaurant in 2001, in which 16 people were killed. Israeli radio reported Saturday that 182 files for pardons were submitted to the president for prisoners convicted in Israeli criminal courts. Remaining pardon requests will be handled by the Israeli Defense Forces officials. On Friday, the terror victims association Almagor petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend the release until the deal is thoroughly examined. More petitions against the deal are expected to be submitted Sunday by families of victims directly affected by the prisoners on the list. The Ministry of Justice announced it will operate an information center ""where information regarding prisoners on the list can be obtained."" Of the male prisoners on the list, 275 will return to their homes in Gaza. Most of the rest will be sent to the West Bank or East Jerusalem. Five prisoners who are Israeli citizens can return to their homes, and 39 are to be sent abroad.","NEW: Israeli releases list of first group of prisoners proposed for exchange .

"The United Kingdom took a step Friday toward being the first country in the world to allow a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using DNA from three people that could prevent mitochondrial diseases but that also raises significant ethical issues. One in 6,500 babies in the United Kingdom is born with mitochondrial disorder, which can lead to serious health issues such as heart and liver disease, respiratory problems and muscular dystrophy. Problems with mitochondria, the ""powerhouse"" cells of the body, are inherited from the mother, so the proposed IVF treatment would mean an affected woman could have a baby without passing on mitochondrial disease. But the cutting-edge IVF technique, which involves transferring nuclear genetic material from a mother's egg or embryo into a donor egg or embryo that's had its nuclear DNA removed, raises ethical questions. The new embryo will contain nuclear DNA from the intended father and mother, as well as healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a ""three-parent"" baby. The amount of donor DNA in the mitochondria will, however, be much less than the parental DNA in the nucleus, which determines the baby's characteristics. IVF-related birth defects may originate with moms, not treatment . The UK government plans to consult on draft regulations on the fertility treatment later this year, with the intention of putting the measure before parliament next year. At the moment, only unaltered eggs and embryos can be used for in vitro fertilization. ""Mitochondrial disease, including heart disease, liver disease, loss of muscle coordination and other serious conditions like muscular dystrophy, can have a devastating impact on the people who inherit it,"" said the UK's chief medical officer, professor Dame Sally Davies. Since scientists have developed ""ground-breaking new procedures"" that could prevent these diseases being passed on, Davies said, ""it's only right that we look to introduce this life-saving treatment as soon as we can."" The government says public consultation shows there is ""overall support"" for the treatment. But Dr. David King, director of Human Genetic Alert, a London-based watchdog group, opposed use of the technique Friday -- saying it opened the door to the creation of ""designer babies"" -- and disputed the results of the public consultation, saying not enough weight has been given to online polling. ""These techniques are unnecessary and unsafe and were in fact rejected by the majority of consultation responses,"" he said in a statement. ""It is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of an utterly biased and inadequate consultation."" King told CNN that conventional egg donation already allows a mother to bear a child without passing on a mitochondrial disorder, so the benefit of the new technique would only be to allow the baby to be genetically related to her. ""While I can understand that, that's not a medical benefit to anybody -- and you have to weigh it against the risks of invasive techniques that will clearly carry a risk to the child,"" he said. Could 'personhood' bills outlaw IVF? There's also a ""risk to society at large,"" he said, because once the ethical line over modification of human DNA has been crossed, the door will be opened to ""the next step and the next step after that."" ""That's why governments around the world over the last 20 years have said 'we won't allow you to genetically engineer human beings,' "" he said. Even if approved by lawmakers, more research is needed to ensure that the procedure actually works in humans and can be carried out safely, King said. The government's announcement Friday prompted a slew of UK media headlines -- and will probably continue to divide the scientific community. The UK-based Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which carried out a six-month inquiry into the ethical issues around the technique, concluded that the health and social benefits of living free from mitochondrial disorders meant that ""on balance ... if these novel techniques are adequately proven to be acceptably safe and effective as treatments, it would be ethical for families to use them."" Its working group also concluded that ""mitochondrial donation does not indicate, either biologically or legally, any notion of the child having either a 'third parent,' or 'second mother.' "" But University of Notre Dame law professor O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist who specializes in the governance of science, medicine and biotechnology, urged the United Kingdom to ""proceed slowly and cautiously"" given the ""unresolved safety and ethical questions"" around the new technique. ""Little is known about the short- and long-term genetic effects of this procedure on children born with its aid,"" he said. ""It would be an ironic tragedy if this procedure were rushed from bench to bedside, only to harm the very children it was meant to help. ""Moreover, there remain serious questions about the ethics of conceiving children with three genetic progenitors or 'parents.'

"(CNN) -- In January 2010, a hardcore ""Transformers"" fan going by ""gaastra"" on a message board for Shout! Factory (a DVD and CD company ""for the discerning pop culture geek"") asked the simple question, ""What would it take to get the Takara shows a release in America?"" Before long, Shout! Factory DVD producer Brian Ward was asking fans how much interest they would have in such a release and what they would like to see on it. 18 months later, the first of the ""Takara shows,"" known as ""Transformers: Headmasters,"" was officially released Tuesday for the first time in the United States. Such is the relationship that geek-friendly companies like Shout! have with fans that this release has seen the light of day. ""I'm really excited about it,"" said Michael Albert of Bear, Delaware, moderator of Seibertron.com, a ""Transformers"" community site that boasts as many as 300,000 page views per day (mostly by fans whose interest in ""Robots in Disguise"" goes well beyond one of the biggest box office successes of the year, ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" and its predecessors). ""This is the first time we've gotten a legitimate release of this Japanese series. You would have to get recordings of them burned onto DVDs, or import them from Australia or Europe, or find a laser-disc player from the 1980s to watch this."" Albert and others from Seibertron.com -- one of many fan sites like tfarchive.com, tformers.com and tfw2005.com -- said that these releases were one of the most sought-after items by fans over the years. The Transformers first became a pop cultural phenomenon in the U.S. in the mid-'80s, based on a pair of toy lines from Japan's Takara company, Microman and Diaclone. When interest in the characters faded after a very short-lived fourth season of the original ""G1"" animated series, it came full circle with the Japanese producing ""Headmasters,"" the first in a series of anime which took the characters in a wild new direction, involving new characters who were able to detach their heads, which were entirely separate characters (the U.S. series only touched on this concept briefly before it ended). ""It really is interesting to see just how the Japanese and their culture played into a series that for most of us we've only known as straightforward Autobots vs Decepticons,"" said Ward, a ""Transformers"" fan himself who has produced all of the Shout! Factory releases of other series, such as ""G1"" and the 1990s ""Transformers: Beast Wars."" ""[The Takara anime series] really bends towards a lot of things that Japanese children want to see,"" said Albert. ""After 'Headmasters' is over, the Transformers are not so much sentient robots but having human drivers. From what I understand, Japanese children prefer having human drivers."" Ward pointed out other, more subtle culture differences. ""Where the G1 characters would call Optimus Prime 'optimus' -- they were pretty casual with their leader -- the Japanese approach it very differently. Optimus Prime will be referred in more of a formal manner, he'll be 'Commander' or something among those lines."" ""The Autobots and Decepticons [in these series] are, no pun intended a well ordered machine,"" he said. ""It's interesting to watch those characters change culturally."" ""Some major characters die early on,"" said Matt Brown of Canton, Michigan, a podcaster at Seibertron.com. ""Later in the series, another major character bites the dust. They don't mess around."" As with any anime import, there is the eternal debate of ""subbed versus dubbed."" There are some fans who simply do not want to watch subtitles. Kim Manning, head programmer for Adult Swim (which is owned by Time Warner, also owner of CNN), and one of the top people responsible for what anime series are seen in the United States, said that every effort is made to get dubbed versions. ""I think they're more likely to reach a more mainstream audience, and we're always hoping to get a larger audience excited about anime,"" she said. ""I think hearing it in your native language allows you to get more absorbed in the action, and to pay more attention to the animation, which is often just gorgeous."" In the case of ""Headmasters"" however, the episodes are not dubbed, but have brand-new subtitles. ""We saw the releases that had come out in the U.K. and Australia and saw that the subtitles there weren't entirely accurate, and in some cases didn't make sense,"" said Ward. ""It was clear that the folks who had translated did not use English as their first language. We gave it to a really good captioning and subtitling house in L.A. and they did a brilliant job of accurately translating the dialogue and understanding what was being said. We got those scripts approved by Hasbro (owners of 'Transformers'), and we're really happy with the outcome. The translation is about as close as one can get to an accurate translation of what's being said in Japanese."" Dubbed versions of the series are out there, however, including one for Malaysian and Singapore television. ""When we heard them, it really got to a point where it was comical,"" Ward explaned. ""The voices were awful. Names would change. Soundwave disappears and is simply replaced by 'New Soundwave.' It was almost the equivalent of watching a Saturday afternoon martial arts movie dub, and that's certainly not something we wanted to do with a property as beloved as 'Transformers,' so we opted out of original dubs and went for brand new subtitles."" Early fan reaction to this was not entirely positive. ""There was a small bit of disappointment that the project couldn't secure enough funding to do a brand-new English dub,"" said Seibertron.com podcaster Bob King of Ashley, Pennsylvania. ""I kind of share that feeling, but I also know that this isn't going to be a very mainstream release, and for them to spend that much money would be kind of a gamble. I appreciate that they're staying cautious."" ""People who have not seen it before might be disappointed in the subtitles, but rest assured [that the existing dubs] are that horrible,"" said Seibertron.com founder Ryan Yzquierdo, from Chicago, Illinois. ""You can't actually sit there and watch the dubs, unless you like drinking while watching 'Transformers.'"" Albert said that the Takara series' legacy extends beyond a mere curiosity: ""The themes are non-Western compared to what Hasbro does now but some of the design aesthetics do play into what we see today."" The other Takara series will be released in the near future as ""The Japanese Collection,"" though a production delay has postponed its release for several weeks. Despite those delays and some early hesitation from the subtitle-phobic, Yzquierdo said that most fans are just excited to check the shows out: ""This is something that I never thought I would see released in the States."" Indeed, this is just the latest example of fans communicating directly with companies to make a difference in what material is released to the public. Manning has communicated often with a ""vibrant"" community of fans on the Adult Swim message boards. ""We definitely look at what people are talking about online, what people are watching and buying online, too. From that, we're always looking for shows that we think will appeal to our audience, and then we pass it around the office -- several of us are anime fans, as well, so we make our own focus group."" As for the importance of the release of ""Headmasters"" specifically, Ward said, ""It gives [fans] something definitive, something approved by Hasbro. Casual fans who just love Transformers will be really surprised by the quality of the show. These were things that were almost, for lack of a better word, lost to American audiences.""","Japan's ""Transformers: Headmasters"" released in U.S. for the first time .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British adventurer has overcome sea sickness to complete his around the world trip relying only on the goodwill of people using social networking site Twitter. Paul Smith poses in New York in a picture posted on his Flickr page. Paul Smith aimed to travel to Campbell Island in New Zealand, the opposite side of the planet to his home in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 30 days. In the end he fell just short -- reaching Stewart Island at the foot of New Zealand's South Island. There was not another boat to the more southerly Campbell Island -- a UNESCO World Heritage site -- until November. During his trip Smith visited the Netherlands, France, Germany and the U.S. -- where he was given a free flight to New Zealand -- and had his photo taken with Hollywood actress Liv Tyler. He also raised more than $7,000 for a water charity. More on his journey . His self-imposed golden rule was that he could only accept offers of travel and accommodation from people who use Twitter, a micro-blogging service that allows people to ""tweet"" what they're up to (or what they're thinking about) in 140 characters or less.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- By its very nature, jatropha is divisive. The poisonous, deep-rooted shrub is traditionally used as hedging to protect food crops from hungry animals. Workers tend Jatropha plants at a D1 Oils farm in Hluthi district, Swaziland, July 19, 2007. Now it has a new purpose, and this time it's dividing opinion. Some say it can help solve the world's fuel crisis, others say there are too many uncertainties to call it a sure bet, while environmentalists have another set of reasons again for objecting to its large-scale production. Jatropha is native to Central America but in recent years the shrub has been propagated around the world by developers convinced of its potential as a source of oil. Seeds are being sown in India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Brazil and large swathes of Africa. Research firm New Energy Finance estimates that more than 720 thousand hectares of jatropha have been planted. By 2014, it estimates that number to have risen three-fold to over 21 million hectares. There's little argument that the seeds can be crushed to extract oil that, once refined, makes a high-quality biodiesel. The question is whether enough oil can be derived from large-scale plantations to make the product economically viable. In a research note released in early March, New Energy Finance said: ""While the positive claims on jatropha are plentiful, promises of high yields in sub-optimal conditions are as yet unproven."" ""Concrete figures on productivity and seed oil yields are at best limited and those that are available often contradict stated projections. This is especially the case in marginal conditions, where jatropha is supposed to prove its worth."" The believers . Stanley Wootliff, the chairman of British-based jatropha producer Viridas, has little time for doubters. ""There are a lot of people out there who make pronouncements on all sorts of subjects based on gut feeling without knowing anything in depth about what they're talking about,"" he says. ""Anyone who was not positive about jatropha I would put under that category because they haven't done their research."" Viridas is doing its research. It has planted a small trial plantation in Brazil where it's testing how much difference varying amounts of water and fertilizer make to the shrub's yield. ""We already know it's going to work. If you take wild jatropha seeds growing in the middle of anywhere, uncultivated, and crush them, you'd get a yield of 1.8 tonnes per hectare and that is economically viable,"" Wootliff says. ""What we're saying is that's the average yield, therefore one would expect the yields to improve."" Once the results are known at the end of the year, the group plans to go back to the market to raise more money for large-scale production. ""Brazil has 90 million hectares of unused land at this moment in time,"" Wootliff says. ""Nothing's growing on it. Historically it was forest -- they chopped it down. We're coming back and reforesting it."" Seeds of hope . It's easy to see how the buzz has developed around jatropha as the next big thing in biofuel. Jatropha's deep root system allows it to grow on marginal land. And, unlike traditional biofuel crops of soy, corn, canola and palm oil, it's poisonous, rendering the argument of food versus fuel irrelevant. Fully grown crops can be five meters tall and because only the seeds are harvested jatropha qualifies for inclusion in reforestation projects. On paper it sounds ideal, but environmentalists have reservations about its large-scale production. ""Jatropha is at the moment being promoted as a wonder crop but that's actually not true,"" says Kenneth Richter, biofuels campaigner for Friends of the Earth. ""Jatropha can grow on relatively poor soils, but obviously it grows far better on good soils. What we see in reality, if you go to India and places in Africa, is that western companies are going in and buying up large amounts of land from the farmers."" He says the poisonous plant is being introduced to areas where it's not native, threatening and, in some cases, killing local wildlife. And furthermore, he says, once it's been planted, it's there to stay. ""It's particularly difficult to get rid of once you've grown the plants; it's basically a weed in some countries."" Keeping the faith . British-based jatropha producer D1 Oils is a pioneer of the industry. The business was founded by entrepreneur Karl Watkin and listed on London's Alternative Investment Market in 2004. On March 7, the company warned that it was consulting its workforce about job losses, saying imports of heavily subsidized biodiesel from the U.S. had eroded margins to the point where it had no choice but to consider reducing costs. The company's share price plummeted, prompting Karl Watkin's resignation. He issued a scathing statement saying he'd become ""increasingly frustrated"" over ""the inability of the investment community, governments and NGOs to differentiate D1's strategy from that of the suppliers of palm, soya and rapeseed whose biodiesel products have been well documented as being environmentally unsustainable."" Graham Prince, communications director of D1 Oils, says in some cases jatropha has been the victim of unsubstantiated hype. ""The key thing is that people need to be realistic about jatropha and its yields."" ""We're at the first stage of commercialization of these crops,"" he says, adding ""even at the first stage we're seeing very promising yields."" While keen to put expectations in perspective, D1 Oils, in partnership with oil company BP, has announced plans to plant 50,000 hectares of so-called ""elite seed"" this year, capable of producing 2.7 tonnes of oil per hectare. Harry Boyle, analyst at New Energy Finance says his team won't be convinced of the potential of jatropha until it sees firm figures on the table. 'It's like what they say about Brazil -- it's the country for the future and it always will be. People have been getting excited about jatropha for two or three years."" ""Until you see a one million hectare plantation producing regular amounts of jatropha crude year after year then it's hard to see how quickly the jatropha industry will progress."" That could be some time away. Many of the seeds that were planted in the rush to gain first mover advantage in what producers say could be a very lucrative field are still years away from maturity. What is agreed right now is that there's very little scientific information about large-scale production of jatropha oil. While analysts and cautious investors are content to wait for the plant to prove its worth, for producers and speculators there's no time to waste.

"Washington (CNN) -- When Chris Christie praises President Barack Obama as ""outstanding"" and ""incredibly supportive,"" you know something extraordinary has occurred. Obama updated on Sandy; praised by Christie . In this case, it was once-in-a-lifetime Superstorm Sandy, which caused the outspoken Republican governor of New Jersey to declare a state of emergency and seek federal help for widespread devastation. Interviewed Tuesday on NBC, Christie described Obama's response as ""outstanding,"" and he told CNN that the president had been ""incredibly supportive and helpful to our state."" ""This is much more important than any election,"" Christie told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Obama has ""been outstanding to deal with on this and I look forward to seeing him tomorrow so he can see for himself what this hurricane has done to my state,"" Christie said Tuesday night. Such effusive praise from a frequent Obama critic and strong supporter of Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney put the campaign magnifying glass on a key election issue -- the role of the federal government -- a week before the November 6 vote. Photos: Aftermath of Superstorm Sandy . It also focused attention on how Romney would handle such a disaster if he were to defeat Obama in what is expected to be a very close election. On Tuesday, the GOP candidate showed little inclination to address the matter. At a campaign event changed to a storm relief effort in Ohio, Romney ignored shouted questions by reporters on whether he supported the Federal Emergency Management Agency's role in disaster relief. Instead, he focused his remarks to supporters who donated relief supplies for storm victims on how such efforts contribute to meeting the overall need. ""We won't be able to solve all the problems with our effort this morning,"" Romney said, adding ""one of the things you learn in life is you make the difference you can, and you can't always solve all the problems yourself."" Romney on storm aftermath: 'People are hurting' Democratic critics of Romney and his running mate -- conservative House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- argue their proposals to cut government spending and provide broad tax cuts without generating more government revenue will end up harming the economy and increasing the federal deficit. Photos: New York recovers from Sandy . In particular, the Obama campaign challenges Romney's contention that increased economic growth from the tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states, the private sector and humanitarian agencies and charities can balance the budget. Last year, Romney argued at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire that cutting federal spending should be based on prioritizing what is absolutely necessary and shedding the rest. Asked by moderator John King of CNN if disaster relief efforts should be turned over to states, Romney said that ""every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better."" ""Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep?"" Romney added. ""We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in."" King cut in to ask if Romney was referring specifically to disaster relief, a topic in the news at the time following a deadly Joplin, Missouri, tornado, and Romney continued: ""We cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all."" Romney: States should handle emergency management . With then-Hurricane Sandy bearing down on the East Coast on Monday, Romney's debate comments from 16 months earlier became a topic of political discussion, and the Romney campaign issued a statement in response. Sandy reminds us of climate change and other forgotten campaign issues . ""Gov. Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions,"" said the statement by spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg. ""As the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA."" Henneberg added another sentence to the statement Tuesday, saying that ""a Romney-Ryan administration will always ensure that disaster funding is there for those in need. Period."" Opinion: Sandy shows why we need FEMA . Craig Fugate, administrator of the emergency management agency, told reporters Tuesday that the agency had $3.6 billion remaining in its disaster relief fund. The agency works with state and local authorities as well as the American Red Cross and other agencies to help disaster victims rent temporary housing, repair their homes, get loans to cover small business and farm losses, as well as assisting in cleaning up storm debris including hazardous materials. Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the federal response to Sandy was ""working like it's supposed to,"" and he highlighted to reporters in Ohio what he described as unprecedented cooperation between city, state and federal authorities and agencies. A White House statement also emphasized such cooperation, noting Obama spoke by phone with a host of Republican and Democratic governors and mayors from states affected by the storm. Sandy's impact: State by state . Romney has made political dysfunction in Washington a target of his campaign, blaming Obama for what he calls failed leadership in being unable to forge a deficit reduction deal with Republicans. Democrats blame Republicans for what they contend has been an unwillingness to compromise, and the focus on cooperation Tuesday by Obama and Biden appeared to be aimed in part at demonstrating the administration's ability to get things done. The question of the size and scope of the federal government is at the heart of both campaigns. Obama and Democrats argue that entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are vital to the social contract to provide contributing citizens with basic needs, and that government also has a role to play in education and technological development while providing services such as national defense and disaster relief. Opinion: Sandy debunks 'nanny state' Republicans, driven by the party's conservative wing, call for immediate steps to erase the chronic budget deficits and mounting federal debt that they say imperil national security and stability. They want to shrink the size of government and reduce taxes while reforming entitlements by partial privatization, reducing and delaying some benefits and other steps. Sensitive issues such as disaster relief generally play to the advantage of Democrats and their support for government benefits, especially in a time of crisis when images of suffering victims dominate the airwaves. Superstorm Sandy breaks records . Obama has avoided any direct political talk in recent days as the huge storm approached the Eastern seaboard, canceling campaign events and focusing his attention on the administration's response. In statements Monday and Tuesday on the storm and its aftermath, he emphasized the need for a collective response while also making sure to point out the federal role in relief efforts. ""We've been able to get over 1,000 FEMA officials in place, pre-positioned,"" the president said. ""We've been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators, to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding."" He also sounded a main campaign theme by ensuring those hit hardest by the storm that his administration and the entire nation were with them. ""This is a tough time for millions of folks across the Eastern seaboard, but America is tougher and we are tougher because we pull together, we don't leave anybody behind, we make sure that we respond as a nation,"" Obama said. Obama visits Red Cross: 'Storm is not yet over' At about the same time he spoke, the White House announced that Obama will travel to New Jersey on Wednesday ""where he will join Gov. Christie in viewing the storm damage, talking with citizens who are recovering from the storm and thanking first responders who put their lives at risk to protect their communities."" While the president and one of Romney's top supporters will be photographed together responding to disaster, Romney is scheduled to be in Florida for three campaign events.

"Rome (CNN) -- The new pope gave an insight into his choice of the name Francis in an audience with journalists Saturday -- and said how he wished for a church that was both poor and ""for the poor."" His words came in his first meeting with the media since he became the only Jesuit and first Latin American to be chosen as leader of the Roman Catholic Church three days ago. Francis, who before he became pope was known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, said a fellow cardinal from Brazil had told him ""don't forget the poor"" as the votes stacked up in his favor. This thought stuck in his mind, Francis said, as it became clear that he had won the two-thirds majority that meant he was the new pontiff. ""Right away, with regard to the poor, I thought of St. Francis of Assisi, then I thought of war,"" he told the assembled journalists. ""Francis loved peace and that is how the name came to me."" He had also thought of St. Francis of Assisi's concern for the natural environment, he said, and how he was a ""poor man, a simple man, as we would like a poor church, for the poor."" St. Francis of Assisi, who gave up his own wealth and prestige, is revered among Catholics for his work with the poor. The journalists included Vatican communications staff and several Latin American reporters, mostly from Argentina. Francis began by thanking them all for their efforts to share with the world the momentous events for the church in the days since Benedict announced his unexpected resignation. Pope Francis a pontiff of firsts . Blessing for all . He drew a parallel between the work of the media and that of the church, saying both worked to communicate ""truth, beauty and goodness."" The media also had an important role to play in explaining the way the church works, he said, which is made more complicated by the role played by faith rather than more worldly or political concerns. The new pope concluded the audience -- which did not include questions -- with a blessing for all the journalists present and their families. He acknowledged that not all those present were Catholic, saying he gave them his blessing ""knowing that you are of different religions, because all of you are children of God."" 5 things to know about the new pope . As a cardinal in Buenos Aires, Francis developed close relations with Argentina's Jewish community. He wrote to the chief rabbi in Rome this week, saying he strongly hoped to ""contribute to the progress of the relations that have existed between Jews and Catholics"" since the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s, which redrew the church's relations with the modern world, ""in a spirit of renewed collaboration."" On Sunday, Francis will celebrate Mass in Vatican City and for the first time deliver the Angelus, or noon blessing, from his papal apartment window to the crowds gathered below in St. Peter's Square. The official Mass to inaugurate Francis as the bishop of Rome -- and leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics -- takes place Tuesday. Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . Reforms to come? Francis has already struck observers with his simple and humble style since being elected to the papacy -- and prompted speculation that he may bring in wider changes. The Vatican said Saturday that he's decided that the heads of the various Vatican offices will keep their jobs for now, but he's not making any definitive appointments. This, writes CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, who's also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, is the first clear signal that he may be serious about reform. ""It's customary for new popes to swiftly reconfirm the department heads who lose their positions when the previous pontificate ends, and then take his time about bringing in his team,"" said Allen. ""The fact that Francis has not followed that path may suggest that significant personnel moves will come sooner rather than later."" Francis wants ""a certain period for reflection, prayer and dialogue before [making] any definitive nomination or confirmation,"" the Vatican statement said. Military dictatorship . The pope's media audience came only a day after the Vatican sought to damp down reports over his conduct during Argentina's so-called Dirty War, amid accusations that he could have done more to protect two Jesuit priests who were kidnapped. The Vatican rejected the allegations as defamatory and untrue in a news conference Friday. ""This was never a concrete or credible accusation in his regard. He was questioned by an Argentinian court as someone aware of the situation but never as a defendant. He has, in documented form, denied any accusations,"" said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. ""Instead, there have been many declarations demonstrating how much Bergoglio did to protect many persons at the time of the military dictatorship,"" he said. Francis will meet with his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, in a week, the Vatican said Saturday. The March 23 meeting will take place at the papal summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, where Benedict has been staying since his historic resignation. It comes amid concern in some quarters that the presence of a living former pope might lead to a conflict of interests or influence. The Vatican has said that Benedict will not seek to interfere in the running of the church, but will focus on study and prayer. First Latin American pope 'very exciting,' faithful say .

"(CNN) -- Last month, thousands of people in Saudi Arabia opened up their newspapers to find a full-page picture of a woman with a black eye clearly visible underneath her burqa. Below the image ran the slogan in Arabic, ""Some things can't be covered"", and a list of phone numbers for local domestic abuse shelters. In a culture that tends to turn a blind eye to the issue of violence towards women, it was a shocking and powerful image. ""It's a problem that's been swept under the carpet for years,"" says Scott Abbott, the creative director for Memac Ogilvy, the Riyadh-based agency responsible for the advert. When Ogilvy approached the King Khalid Foundation, a charity that focuses on issues of advocacy and developing the country's non-profit sector, they weren't sure what type of reaction to expect. ""I think that there was always a real concern that, given the subject matter, it would never get through,"" says Abbott. A major push came from Saudi princess HRH Banderi A.R. Al Faisal, the foundation's director. Though the campaign has captured the public's attention, both within Saudi and abroad, where an English version has made the rounds online, Al Faisal says she doesn't see the ad as shocking. ""My media and PR team were a bit nervous going into this, saying, 'Are you sure you want to do this?'"" she admits. ""I didn't understand why. I don't understand what is so controversial. Who will say, 'Yes, it's ok for women to be beaten up'?"" Read more: Women directors find acclaim worldwide . Saudi women are legally reliant on the permission of their male guardians to travel freely, driving is still a socially contentious issue and there are no laws that protect victims of domestic abuse. According to Al Faisal, however, change is in the air. ""For several years, domestic abuse was sort of the elephant in the room. There was nowhere for a woman to go if she was abused because a system wasn't set up to handle that,"" she admits. Though the issue is still not completely out in the open, she notes the last few years has seen a rise in shelters that cater to female victims of violence. It has been a watershed year for women's rights in the conservative country. So far, women have been accepted into the government's advisory Shura Council, given the right to vote, gained entry into a range of new professions (including engineering and law) and granted permission to have their own IDs without guardian permission. Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, admits that though these measures are impressive, more needs to be done to protect women inside the country. ""There are no laws that protect women specifically. If, for example, a woman claims rape, and a man says it was consensual, she can face a counter charge of adultery,"" he says. Though there is currently no law that punishes a man for beating his wife, the King Khalid Foundation has prepared legislation that would do just that. In fact, it is the pending bill, which would decide the punitive measures abusers could face (a mix of imprisonment, financial restitution and loss of custody), that spurred the campaign to begin with. Last year, the Shura Council pushed through similar legislation the foundation helped pen protecting the rights of children in abusive situations. Al Faisal is confident that the drafted legislation will meet with the same level of success. Read more: The Saudi museum with more Facebook likes than the Louvre . Coogle, however, says that Saudi still needs to overcome considerable social hurdles before the situation improves. ""Women who speak out about emotional abuse or neglect often face societal judgments. There is a prevalent attitude that if a man hits his wife, it's acceptable, because she's not being a good wife."" Coogle points to a ten year old study in the Journal of Muslim Affairs where Saudi men were polled on whether they ever hit their wives -- 53% answered yes. Al Faisal agrees that the Saudi mindset has to change and notes that a major obstacle is the naturally guarded nature of the culture. ""This is a very private society, and we tend to try to deal with things discreetly. We do not air our dirty laundry in public, as families or as communities,"" she says. ""The negative side of that discretion is that it allows abusive behavior to thrive, because it is not stopped."" A main goal of the campaign is to create a countrywide social dialogue. In that regard, says Abbott, the campaign has been successful. ""Outside of the two days of ads we ran, it's been printed on the front page of national newspapers,"" he says. ""People are talking about it, and it's been largely well-received.""","Saudi Arabia has launched its first anti-domestic abuse ad campaign .

"(CNN)Thirty years ago Wednesday, more than three dozen stars -- many fresh from the American Music Awards -- checked their egos at the door and piled into a recording studio to record ""We Are the World."" The basic tracks for the Lionel Richie-Michael Jackson composition had been done a week earlier, but it was this January 28, 1985, session that counted -- the one that included Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Billy Joel and many other of the biggest artists of the day (and, in many cases, of all time).

"(CNN) -- Syria's civil war has been grinding on for nearly two years now, resulting in the deaths of more than 60,000 people, according to estimates from the office of the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner. More than 500,000 Syrians have sought refuge in neighboring countries, and the U.N. believes that number could top a million in the coming year. Will the situation improve in 2013, or will the bloody stalemate continue? There have been encouraging signs lately for the opposition, which has made military gains against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But some observers say al-Assad's grip on power remains strong. CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, who have reported from inside Syria, analyze the conflict and what the future may hold. Will the rebels defeat the regime? Nick Paton Walsh: I think there's very little doubt that will happen. It's not going to be one day in which there's a decisive changing of the flags over a building in Damascus and then the whole country turns 180 degrees in terms of its government. But there have been weeks now of consistent bad news for the regime. ... That affects not only how people feel inside the regime's inner circle, it affects how their sponsors feel. And, of course, it boosts morale for the rebels as well. So that real sense of momentum has been in place for months. It's beginning to nip around the capital, and I don't think any observer at this point thinks that the Assad government really has a chance in terms of retaining long-term power over the country. Will al-Assad stay and fight until the end as he has said? Or will he go? Nic Robertson: The rebels have said that they won't rest until Assad is completely gone; they won't negotiate with them. But he's showing no signs of leaving whatsoever. Perhaps there are early indications that Assad does realize that he cannot hold on to complete power as he has in the past. So perhaps what we're seeing is the regime entering a new phase now where, rather than fight to hold on to everything, they're fighting to have a better negotiating position in the future. Paton Walsh: The question really is how messy is that final stand of Assad actually going to be? You'll see pockets of these regime forces, particularly in the north, being left to their own devices. ... The real problem of course is going to be how does the rebel militia, how do these disparate groups deal with these Allawi military prisoners once they've actually taken them into custody? If al-Assad is overthrown, then what? Paton Walsh: There will be a period of definitely chaos, warlordism perhaps, and sort of a vacuum whilst the armed groups who won the rebellion struggle for some degree of control over territory. I don't really agree with the more dramatic visions of a nightmare future in Syria that's something between ""Mad Max"" and the Taliban. I think it's going to be a much more watered-down version of that. I think there's an optimism, perhaps amongst many Syrians, that they are educated, moderate in terms of the Islamic values they have. And remember also, this wasn't really a rebellion started over Islamic principles. It is not Iran or Afghanistan. This was about trying to reject what they saw as a corrupt and repressive regime. ... It's classic in these situations, once the major battle is finished, for world attention to radically drift elsewhere onto the next crisis. But that will be the moment when Syria needs help at its most. It will be the moment where the Syrians finally expect the West to actually step in now that the complicated issue of who's arming who and who's fighting who has been put aside. What kind of help will Syria need? Robertson: The economy in Syria is completely destroyed, and it's going to take years to rebuild. So any notion that there can be a quick turnaround in 2013 is fiction. What we're going to see in 2013 are large numbers of displaced people, millions internally inside the country. Thousands, tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people without shelter, their homes have been destroyed. Large areas of Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo have been destroyed, people without homes. And they're going to be desperate for food. Paton Walsh: I think once the majority of the violence ends, once the nuts and bolts of the civil war are behind them, then food, utilities will come back reasonably quickly because of the nature of where Syria is and who it's bordered by. The real question though is, how do you rebuild a country where so many districts of so many of its cities have already been flattened in many ways? I mean, two or three months ago, Aleppo was in pieces, really struggling to keep anything going. Robertson: You have this whole opposition that hasn't even engaged yet with the opposition outside of the country and the opposition that's fighting there. So to see how they're going to get together and govern together is very difficult. ... Any sort of sense of these opposition groups want to coalesce around democracy, those are not the indications we have at the moment. They're talking about ""We won't stop until we get rid of Assad."" These are not people who are showing a great ability to compromise so far. How will the world respond or help or engage with the new Syria? Paton Walsh: I think, in many ways, the process of that is under way, with the U.S. trying to influence a government in exile (and) many opposition figures gathering in Doha or Turkey to try and work out how that government would look like. But the problem is that might not relate to the daily struggles people are facing on the ground inside Syria after what would be a two-year long war. And bridging that gulf between the men in suits in five-star hotels ... and people on the ground who may be starving or missing the roof of their house from shelling is going to be the enormous challenge. Robertson: Distrust is endemic region-wide. The distrust of the United States and Europe is deep-rooted in the culture in Syria already from 40 years of Assad rule, from watching what's happened in other Arab countries, from hearing what radical Islamists say what the West is trying to do with Islam. All these things have been fomenting in the background. And now you have a scenario where the West hasn't come to the aid of the Syrians, so people are deeply angry. I don't think we're going to find friends quickly in Syria. We're certainly not going to win trust there quickly. And that's going to make whatever we want to see -- the international community wants to see happen in Syria -- that's going to make it much, much harder to achieve.

"(CNN) -- German car manufacturer Mercedes completed a takeover of the rebranded Brawn GP Formula One team on Monday, after its parent company Deimler acquired all remaining shares from team principal Ross Brawn and his management partners. In collaboration with its largest shareholder Aabar, Deimler purchased the remaining 24.9% of the team, which is now known as Mercedes GP. German corporation Deimler initially bought a 45.1% share of the team when it was called Brawn GP in November 2009, and that stake has now risen to 60%. Aabar, a global investment company owned by the Abu Dhabi government, now owns 40% of Mercedes GP. ""Daimler and Aabar's acquisition of the remaining 24.9% stake will be a further step in the consolidation and strengthening of our team for the future,"" Brawn told the official F1 website. ""I remain fully committed to our team for the long-term, along with the management team and all of our employees. We all look forward to the challenge of making our team successful, and proudly representing Mercedes-Benz."" The Brawn GP team competed in the elite motorsport for only one season, after the completion of a management buyout of the Honda Racing team in February 2009. The 2009 season was a huge success for the British-based team, as they clinched the constructors' title as well as the drivers' championship through British racer Jenson Button. The team was renamed Mercedes GP for the 2010 campaign, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the constructors' standings. The German duo of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher and 25-year-old Nico Rosberg will once again race for the team in 2011. Elsewhere, last year's double world champions Red Bull have announced a sponsorship deal with luxury carmaker Infiniti. The Japanese manufacturer, which is parented by Nissan, has a marketing agreement with the British-based marque which will cover the 2011 and 2012 seasons. Infiniti's logo will now be present on Red Bull's new RB7 car and their drivers' overalls. Team principal Christian Horner hailed the new deal and said the agreement will have both commercial and technical benefits for Red Bull. ""The technical wealth and resources that Infiniti have at their disposal through Nissan is quite phenomenal,"" Horner told CNN. ""As an independent team, it was the one piece that Red Bull previously didn't have compared to the likes of Ferrari and Mercedes. So for us, it's important as a technology partner and a commercial partner."" German driver Sebastian Vettel became the youngest-ever winner of the drivers' championship for Red Bull in 2010, and the 23-year-old will begin the defense of his crown at the Australian Grand Prix on March 27.","Mercedes have completed their takeover of the F1 team formerly known as Brawn GP .

"(CNN) -- Sarah McLachlan, the Grammy Award winning singer and songwriter whose ballads helped so many of us through heartache, breakups and loss, was barely out of her teenage years when her first album was released back in 1988. Now, she's a 46-year-old divorced mom of two girls touring the country to promote her seventh full-length solo album, called ""Shine On."" ""I'm a whole hell of a lot older,"" she joked, when I asked her, during a casual conversation at CNN's studios earlier this week, how much her life has changed. McLachlan credits her success in the '90s, fueled by memorable hits such as ""I Will Remember You"" and ""Angel,"" with allowing her to take time off, have children and be a full-time parent. Her girls, now ages 7 and 12, have traveled on tour with her since they were babies. ""They're the great leveler because they couldn't care less what it is that I do for a living,"" she said with a laugh. The three-time Grammy Award winner and Canadian-born singer didn't quite set out on her career to empower women, but that's what she's done. She spearheaded the Lilith Fair, a concert tour comprised of only female artists and female-led bands in the late 1990s and again in 2010, which raised millions for charities. During our mom-to-mom chat, we talked about her biggest worries as a parent, what she admires about the singer Lorde and why her sex life is thriving. The video above and this transcript of our conversation have been edited for length and clarity: . Kelly: What do you worry about most as a parent? Sarah: Well, social media. I think Facebook is a really dangerous tool in the hands of kids. I really don't think they should be allowed on it until they're 18 or 20 years old because it's a weapon, basically. It's also a great tool but if you're not psychologically evolved enough and aware and empathetic to other people's issues. That concerns me a lot, which is part and parcel why (my daughters) are on computers because they have them at school but I really limit the time they're on them and I say, ""Let's go live in the real world. Let's go play. If you want to talk to your friends, bring them over to the house or go over to their houses and actually play."" I hear these kids hang out at each other's houses and they just ... Kelly: They're all sitting on their phones ... Sarah: I am the biggest jerk on the planet because (my older daughter is) one of the only kids that doesn't have the iTouch or whatever. I say, ""You know what honey, when you are out there in the world and I don't know where you are and we have to stay in contact then you can have one. Right now, I'm a car service. I drive you everywhere and I pick you up from wherever you go."" Kelly: You have commented about performers such as Lorde who posted unretouched photos of herself, basically saying here I am, flaws are OK. How important do you think that is for our girls? Sarah: I think it's imperative because when I grew up, I don't think I even knew ""Vogue"" magazine or any of that stuff. I didn't have any issues with my body. I wasn't overweight, I wasn't skinny. I have a fast metabolism but I just eat and I wear the clothes I wear and I never really even gave it much of a thought. There's just so much pressure on these girls these days. They're looking at all the different teen stars who are wearing hardly anything. Kelly: How important do you think female role models are? Sarah: I think they're imperative. ... Someone like Malala Yousafzai speaking out for girls' education, getting shot and then not dying but rising up and becoming an international superstar and an international heroine. Those kinds of examples of strength, and strength of beliefs and just standing up for what you believe in and not backing down, I think are so imperative. Kelly: Where do you think we are when it comes to the state of women in our world, in our society? Sarah:  There's still a glass ceiling. I think we've come a long way. There are way more women in powerful positions (as) CEOs. There's still a huge discrepancy between how many women are in power in companies and how many men, and inequality in pay ... but we're making strides, absolutely. But now there's this whole thing of having it all. There's no such thing as having it all. There's no such thing as balancing it all. It's a tricky, slippery slope. It's a tightrope that we walk every day and some days we do it really well, and other days we fail miserably at it. Kelly: So let's talk about sex, shall we. (Sarah revealed in a recent interview that she's had more sex this year in her new relationship than she's had in her life, so I had to ask her about that!) Sarah. Oh OK. Kelly: I know we just met but you mentioned in an interview that that part of your life seems to be thriving in your relationship with former NHL player Geoff Courtnall. Sarah: I mean, yeah, there was a long dry spell of a number of years where I didn't date, didn't have a partner, so I was just on my own, with my girls, and yeah I met Geoff. Kelly: Many women in the latter half of their 40s are not necessarily enjoying that same kind of experience. Sarah: No, and it was sort of like a resurgence for me, for sure, because I didn't have sex for years and then all of a sudden, you sort of think, everybody says, what is it, you don't use it you lose it, right, and I thought, oh no, it came back, really quickly. (She laughs.) Kelly: Better than ever. Sarah: Better than ever. Kelly: I have to stop because I am being obnoxious and embarrassing. You have experienced so many things -- obviously your divorce, you left your original management company, a new relationship, raising your children ... Sarah: Lost my dad. Kelly: ""Shine On"" is about all of that, right? Sarah: It's about going through your 40s and all the changes. We don't get to that point in our lives unscathed. We're losing our family members. I lost my brother last November to bowel cancer so there are so many big changes that happen in our 40s, and it's sort of that tipping point of I'm in the second half of my life. To a certain degree I get to choose what this is going to look like. How do I want it to look? And it's sort of a reassessing of everything and I thought I'm so lucky, I'm so blessed. I have so many amazing things that have happened to me. I have my health, I have my kids' health, I have great friends and family. I just want to suck the marrow out of every day that I have left because you just don't know. You don't know when your time is and I want every day to count. Kelly: Absolutely and also important to you, The Sarah McLachlan School of Music for at risk and underserved kids in your community. How important is it to give back? Sarah: To give of yourself, it's like a drug. And when I did Lilith, I made a lot of money and I thought, what am I going to do? I don't live a crazy lifestyle. I have all this extra money. I want to do something important with it. ... We gave over $7 million to charity through Lilith over the three years and so I started the music school because I looked around in Vancouver and thought what do we need? What do kids need? What did I need? I needed music and there are a lot of kids that don't have music in schools anymore. I guess it's the first thing that gets cut from funding. And so we started a small project. It was about 200 kids and now we have over 700 this year. We're going to have over 1,000 kids in the program starting next year 13 years in. Kelly: A tour, a new album, how do you top this, Sarah McLachlan? And what is next? Sarah: I have no idea. Like my kids, I live in the moment. I can't help it. I have a very hard time looking forward, and thinking about what's coming next. I'm just enjoying every moment.

"(CNN) -- Flying penguins are unusual. Especially when they fly on a C-130 Hercules military plane. Almost 400 lost Magellanic penguins march back to the sea after being rescued by animal-welfare groups. In Brazil, 373 young Magellanic penguins were rescued, rehabilitated and released last weekend after their search for food left them stranded, hundreds of miles from their usual feeding grounds. Animal-welfare activists loaded the birds onto a Brazilian air force cargo plane and flew them 1,550 miles to the country's southern coast, where a crowd of onlookers celebrated as the penguins marched back into the sea. ""We are overjoyed to see these penguins waddle back to the ocean and have a second chance at life,"" said veterinarian Dr. Valeria Ruoppolo of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the group that oversaw the rescue.  See photo gallery of rescued penguins » . Magellanic penguins are warm-weather birds that breed in large colonies in southern Argentina and Chile. The young animals then migrate north between March and September, following their favorite fish, the anchovy. The birds are named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who first saw them in 1519. But changes in currents and water temperature apparently confused the juvenile birds, who strayed too far north to the warm beaches of Salvador, Brazil, 870 miles north of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  Watch the penguins march into the sea » . Starting in mid-July, in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahía, ""It was just about raining penguins,"" Ruoppolo said. ""There was not much of a food supply. The birds were stranded and emaciated. They had lost all their muscles and body condition."" While occasionally a few birds show up so far north, the unusual sight of hundreds of wayward penguins posed a challenge for animal conservation groups. ""We had to learn how to work with them,"" said Carlos Garcia, a spokesman for IBAMA, the Brazilian Institute for Environment and Renewable Resources. ""Fewer than 20 penguins usually wash ashore, but with such a large number, we had to really understand their biology and learn how to treat them."" The Instituto Mamíferos Aquáticos (Institute for Aquatic Mammals) also fed and cared for the hungry and disoriented birds. Ruoppolo, who is also the emergency relief officer for IFAW, has a lot of experience saving penguins and other animals injured in oil spills. Last week she worked with conservation groups and volunteers to save as many of the birds as possible. ""We showed them how to stabilize the animals, to feed them and give them proper care,"" she said. Healthy Magellanic penguins grow to about 27 inches tall and weigh about 9 pounds. Ruoppolo said IBAMA -- the government's environmental authority -- and the Brazilian military were supportive throughout the unusual relocation mission. On Friday, the penguins were loaded into special crates and put onto the plane for the journey to Pelotas, in southern Brazil. After their first-ever flight, the birds went on a truck ride to the Center for Recovery of Marine Animals, where they rested for 24 hours. The birds released at Cassino Beach the next day had to meet very specific health criteria, said Ruoppolo. ""Their feathers had to be waterproof, their overall body condition had to be good, their lungs healthy, and they had to be able to catch food,"" she said. The youngsters had some adult supervision for their return to the wild. They were released with a small group of adult penguins that had been nursed back to health after surviving an oil spill. Scientists expect the older birds will help guide the little ones to nearby feeding grounds. Some penguins are still being cared for, both in the north and south of Brazil. The newly released birds have bands on their flippers so scientists can follow their progress and learn more about their migratory habits. Of more than 1,600 penguins that washed ashore in northern Brazil, about half are still alive. That is a fairly good outcome, given the fragile status of young birds on their first migration, said Ruoppolo. ""For all species you have animals that die within the first year,"" she said. And without quick human intervention, the consequences would have been much worse. At this point there is no way to know exactly why the animals became stranded. While the Magellanic penguin population is not in jeopardy because of this one event, Ruoppolo said there are other threats, primarily from overfishing.

"(CNN) -- All BlackBerry service has been restored following the largest network outage in that smartphone's history, Research in Motion executives said in a conference call on Thursday morning. ""We've now restored full services,"" RIM's co-CEO Mike Lazaridis told reporters. Some BlackBerry users may still see e-mails coming in slowly as the system recovers, he said. The major outage frustrated customers on nearly every continent who were unable to send and receive e-mails and text messages this week. It also comes at a bad time for RIM, which is facing increased competition from Android and Apple smartphones. The iPhone 4S is set to be released on Friday, and social media posts suggest some BlackBerry users may switch to other phones in part because of the prolonged break in services. The outage started on Monday in Europe and spread to North America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America over the course of the next two days. A failure at one of the company's messaging servers in Europe, along with the subsequent failure of its backup system, led to a ripple effect that reportedly caused problems for millions of BlackBerry owners. Executives on Thursday did not answer questions about how many people were impacted by the four-day service outage, but they did say this breakdown was the largest in the company's history. ""We've worked 12 yrs since the launch of BlackBerry to win the trust of our 70 million BlackBerry subscribers and we're going to fully commit to win that trust back -- 100%,"" Lazaridis said during the press conference. This is not the first time RIM has faced a major service outage. ""I have been an analyst for 25 years and have watched RIM wrestle with this same outage problem time after time. Every few years we get pinched by yet another major problem,"" tech analyst Jeff Kagan said in a statement. This outage, however, comes at a particularly unfortunate time for RIM, since it faces increasing competition in the smart phone market, Kagan says. BlackBerry users, many of whom use the devices primarily for business purposes, took to the Web to vent their anger about the outage. Twitter and other messaging platforms have been full of complaints since the outage began almost four days ago. The CNN Wire, CNN's Erin McLaughlin and CNNMoney's Julianne Pepitone contributed to this report .","NEW: BlackBerry says service has been fully restored globally .

"(CNN) -- The West Indies team bus has been attacked by Bangladesh fans, following the side's one-sided victory over the co-hosts at the Cricket World Cup. The West Indies secured a nine-wicket victory in 12.2 overs in the Group B game in Mirpur on Friday. Bangladesh scored just 58 runs -- their lowest ever total in a one-day match --which led a group of angry fans to throw stones at the West Indies bus as it traveled back to the team hotel. Should minor nations play at the Cricket World Cup? ""Bangladesh stoning our bus,"" Windies opener Chris Gayle -- who hit his 8000th one-day run during the match -- wrote on social networking site Twitter during the incident.""Glass break. Can't believe...what next bullets!"" The former national captain continued: ""This is ridiculous. World Cup with so many security and this happens. Big Joke. Trust me I'm not keen here."" The Deputy Commissioner of Police in the capital Dhaka claimed that disappointed fans had in fact thought the bus belonged to the Bangladesh team. ""They thought it was the Bangladeshi team bush and they hurled stones at it,"" Imtiaz Ahmed told news agency AFP. ""The window panes were shattered, but no one was injured."" The West Indies' win over Bangladesh marked their second consecutive victory in the World Cup following their win over The Netherlands, and the team now lie second in the table behind South Africa. Sulieman Benn claimed four wickets, while Kemar Roach and Darren Sammy took three each for the West Indies -- encouraging performances for the Caribbean side ahead of their upcoming fixtures against England and Ireland. For Bangladesh the loss means they now find themselves placed sixth out the seven teams in their group, and must beat England in their next tie on March 11 to have any chance of qualifying for the quarterfinal stage. Meanwhile, in the Group A clash at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmadabad, India earlier on Friday, New Zealand defeated Zimbabwe by 10 wickets to claim their second win of the tournament . After bowling out their opponents for just 162 runs, the Kiwis cantered recorded up two half-centuries courtesy of Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum with 99 balls to spare. New Zealand are fourth in their group behind Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Australia, and Zimbabwe lie in fifth place.","West Indies cricket team bus attacked after defeat of Bangladesh in World Cup .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A meningitis outbreak is threatening the lives of tens of thousands of people in Darfur, according to an aid agency expelled from the country last week. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. Humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), says it was preparing to vaccinate around 100,000 people in southern and western Darfur against meningitis, when it was told to leave the country. ""We were in the process of organizing a vaccination campaign. At the moment  there's no one there that can take over those activities, which is really worrying,"" Gemma Davies of MSF told CNN. The country's Ministry of Health officially declared a meningitis outbreak on March 2 at the Kalma Camp, which shelters more than 90,000 refugees in southern Darfur. ""Living in such close proximity, the potential for this outbreak to spread quickly is quite high, Davies, MSF project coordinator for South Darfur, told CNN. ""With no health care providers to give vaccinations, and with no one to manage the meningitis cases when they come, it's really concerning,"" she added. The vaccination campaign was due to begin on March 7, but it is now unclear if or when it will resume, as reports of government harassment of aid workers continue. Davies told CNN she experienced no harassment, and said government officials had  been in contact with only the head of MSF's regional operations. ""We haven't actually been given any reason on why we were expelled,"" she said. ""We have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to return."" Doctors Without Borders was among 13 aid agencies, including Mercy Corps and the International Rescue Committee, that were ordered by the government to shut down their operations in Sudan last week. So far the agency has confirmed 32 meningitis cases and four deaths, and has seen dozens of other suspected cases. Thousands of unvaccinated refugees and villagers are now exposed to the airborne disease in densely populated camps and villages throughout Sudan. ""One of our priorities is to get another organization to take over our programs there,"" Davies added. The medical relief agency says it doubts though that other any other organizations have the capacity to deal with a meningitis epidemic. Davies also said she is worried about the cut-off of MSF's feeding and maternal delivery services: ""We had over 100 patients on our feeding program that now won't be receiving any follow up."" The decision by the Sudanese government to throw out the aid groups came a day after the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. However, not all international aid organizations are affected. Others including World Vision international continues its work, which reaches approximately 500,000 internally displaced people in South Sudan. The U.N. has received reports that international staff members of five non-governmental organizations had been detained for up to four hours. Speaking on the phone from Nairobi, an aid worker, who asked not to be identified for fear of further harassment, told CNN that his colleagues who remained in Khartoum were being intimidated and threatened by government agents. In some cases Sudanese government representatives ""had started gathering banking details and confiscating computers, communications equipment and vehicles from the NGOs"", a U.N spokesman said at a news conference last week. Last week, the U.N. warned that the loss of  NGOs in Sudan would cause 1.1 million people to go without food aid and health care, and more than 1 million to have no access to water. Oxfam, whose work focuses on providing safe drinking water, was one of the aid groups who were told their registration to operate in Sudan was no longer valid. Ninety percent of their staff are Sudanese nationals, who mostly remain in country, unable to continue their relief work under threat of arrest. ""These agencies are vital implementation partners for the United Nations and account for at least half of the humanitarian capacity in Darfur,"" said Catherine Bragg, U.N. Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator at the news conference in New York.","Meningitis threatens hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova once labeled the conditions as ""inhuman"" and three-time defending men's champion Novak Djokovic suffered a dramatic meltdown in a quarterfinal match in 2009 so it's with a degree of trepidation that the world's elite go into the Australian Open with a heatwave forecast for Melbourne. Temperatures are predicted to reach a blistering 42 degrees Celsius Tuesday (107 Fahrenheit) and remain at that level until the weekend. While the opening grand slam of the season has an Extreme Heat Policy -- in place since 1998 -- it is rarely invoked and players simply have to make do. Djokovic, who had to retire with heat exhaustion against Andy Roddick when defending his 2008 crown, has become renowned for his supreme fitness levels and claims to be ready for any challenge. ""I am expecting to play in big heat. You always have to expect it because you can't really predict Melbourne's weather, it's changing a lot,"" Djokovic told gathered reporters on the eve of his title defense. ""I remember the 2008, 2009 and 2010 tournaments, there were several days I played in extreme heat. So I know how tough it is. ""But it's the same for myself and my opponent so you have to adjust to it,"" he said. Given a favorable draw, avoiding the likes of world number one Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Roger Federer until at least the final, Djokovic is unlikely to be troubled by the weather or his first round opponent Lukas Lacko of Slovakia on Monday. After that the level of the opposition and the heat is expected to rise with Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka looming large as his main threat. Wawrinka extended Djokovic in a five-set fourth round clash last year which many considered the outstanding match of 2013. This time around they cannot meet until the semifinals by which time forecasters are predicting a return to more manageable conditions. Sharapova, playing her first grand slam since Wimbledon last year, remains wary of conditions after being reminded of her 2007 three-setter against France's Camille Pin, after which she made her outburst. ""I don't think anyone can prepare themselves for that type of heat,"" she told reporters. ""When you try to put in that effort, that maximum effort to give as an athlete, it's pretty difficult for a longer period of time."" Murray, himself back in action after a layoff for surgery, is also not relishing extreme temperatures despite preparing for the championships in Florida. ""The difference between 32 degrees or whatever in Florida and 40, it's a huge difference. ""It feels very different on the court. The court gets so hot, the air is extremely hot as well,"" said the Scot. If he can get the better of conditions, it is likely that both Roger Federer then Nadal would stand in his path if he wants to repeat last year's men's final showdown with Djokovic. Defending champion Victoria Azarenka and top seed Serena Williams are strongly favored to meet in the women's final and both claim to be unperturbed about the rising temperature gauge. ""I've been here playing for, what, last eight years. It's not a new thing to play in the heat. I actually enjoy that,"" said Azarenka. ""I mean, not all the time probably, but it's nice to get some sun."" Williams tweeted earlier this week to complain about then cold conditions in the Victorian State capital, but claims to be ready for whatever awaits. ""I've been training my whole life in the heat. I think I'm pretty used to it. But obviously the heat in Melbourne is just completely different than any other heat,"" said the American. ""But it's okay. I've just got to be ready to play under any circumstances."" For the record, the hottest Australian Open was in 2009 when the average daily temperature was 34.7 Celsius, with Djokovic the most high-profile victim.","High temperatures expected for Australian Open tennis championships .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- One of two men charged with killing the crew of the Joe Cool charter fishing boat last year has agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder, a victim's relative said. Kirby Archer is expected to plead guilty in exchange for prosecutors dropping the death penalty. Kirby Archer is expected to change his plea to guilty in exchange for a prosecutors' agreement not to seek the death penalty against him, according to Jeff Branam, an uncle of slain boat captain Jake Branam. He said prosecutors told the victims' relatives about the plea deal. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, Florida, declined to comment. Court documents filed Friday show that Archer is scheduled to change his plea at a hearing Thursday. Archer and Guillermo Zarabozo are charged with four counts each of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery in the deaths of Branam; his wife, Kelly; his half-brother Scott Gamble; and first mate Samuel Kairy. None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be. The abandoned Joe Cool was found by the U.S. Coast Guard on September 23, floating about 60 miles south of the island of Bimini. Zarabozo and Archer were found a few hours later, about 10 miles away on a life raft. The two had paid the Joe Cool crew $4,000 in cash to take them to the Bahamas from Miami, where they said they were planning to meet some girlfriends. The trip should have taken about an hour each way. The boat did not return. Zarabozo told authorities the boat had been hijacked by pirates who fatally shot Jake and Kelly Branam and ordered the crew thrown overboard but spared the two of them. This spring, Zarabozo said in court documents that Archer killed the crew, using Zarabozo's gun. No gun was found. Police believe that the bodies of the crew were pitched overboard between Miami and Cuba. Jeff Branam said the victims' relatives met with prosecutors a few days ago. ""They said he was going to plead guilty,"" he said of Archer. ""I would have liked to have seen him get the death penalty, but if he's going to be in prison for the rest of his life with no chance of getting out, that'll work."" CNN was unable to reach Archer's defense attorney. Jeff Branam said the government's case against the two appears strong but said he's glad a jury won't decide Archer's fate. ""I think they have a lot of circumstantial evidence,"" he said. ""If you have just one person on a jury who might feel there were pirates, they might not [convict],"" he said. ""Without bodies, it could be an uphill battle."" Archer, 36, was once an Army MP who served at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Investigators and victims' family members say they were told he wanted to go back to Cuba. Archer befriended Zarabozo, 20, who left Cuba with his family. Last year, Archer fled to Florida after he was accused of stealing $92,000 from an Arkansas Wal-Mart where he was working. Zarabozo's lawyer, William Matthewman, had little to say about Archer's pending plea. ""All I can say is, Mr. Zarabozo pled not guilty. He maintains his not guilty plea, and he plans to proceed to trial."" No trial date has been set. Jake and Kelly Branam are survived by their children: a girl who was 2 at the time of their deaths and a boy who was 4 months old.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will welcome Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for an official state visit Tuesday. The two leaders will discuss a range of global, regional and bilateral issues, the White House said. Those discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan, climate change and nuclear energy cooperation. Singh has been quoted as saying that a Taliban victory in Afghanistan would be disastrous for Central and South Asia. Singh's visit will be the first state visit hosted by the administration, the highest honor extended to a foreign dignitary. It will be Singh's second visit to Washington; he has also met with former President George W. Bush. Grammy- and Oscar-award-winning singer and actress Jennifer Hudson will entertain the black-tie crowd, several sources involved in the planning outside the administration said. Hudson, raised in Chicago like first lady Michelle Obama, sang the National Anthem at the Democratic National Convention in August 2008 at the request of the Obama campaign, when Obama became the Democratic presidential nominee. Singh arrived Sunday for his five-day visit. On Monday, he attended a luncheon hosted by the U.S.-India Business Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He addressed the Council on Foreign Relations later in the day. Obama will receive the prime minister at the White House on Tuesday, and Singh and his wife will be the guests at an official state dinner Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Singh will meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates and will later attend a reception for the Indian community hosted by Indian Ambassador to the United States Meera Shankar. Singh will leave Washington Thursday morning and fly to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit. Singh, 77, is a Cambridge- and Oxford-educated economist who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982 to 1985 and the nation's finance minister from 1991 to 1996. A member of the Congress Party, he is serving a second five-year term as prime minister. He was sworn in as prime minister in May 2004 and again this past May. He and his wife of 51 years, Gursharan Kaur, have three daughters.","Visit by Indian PM Manmohan Singh is first state visit for Obama administration .

"(CNN) -- Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was sentenced to 10 years in prison Wednesday in a bribery scandal that rocked the city, the U.S. Justice Department said. U.S. District Judge Helen G. Berrigan also ordered that Nagin pay $84,264 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. In February, a jury found him guilty of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and other favors from businessmen looking for a break from his administration. Of the 21 counts against him, he was convicted of 20. The former mayor maintained his innocence even after the conviction. Prosecutors argued that Nagin was at the center of a kickback scheme in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city. A January 2013 indictment detailed more than $200,000 in bribes to the mayor, and his family members allegedly received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City; and cellular phone service. In exchange, businesses that coughed up for Nagin and his family won more than $5 million in city contracts, according to the indictment.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Syrian activists are denouncing the Turkish government in the wake of the Syrian regime's announcement that it has a deserted army officer in custody. Lt. Col. Hussein al-Harmoush defected months ago and began broadcasting video statements denouncing the Syrian government, before eventually fleeing to neighboring Turkey. News of his detention by Syria comes amid persistent international consternation with that country's regime for its fierce crackdown on anti-government protesters, a six-month outpouring that has resulted in more than 2,600 deaths. ""Enough is enough,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said Thursday, urging ""some coherent measures"" against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Omar al-Muqdad, a prominent Syrian opposition activist who is now in exile in Turkey applying for refugee status, said the Turks handed al-Harmoush over to the Syrian secret police. ""The Turkish government is directly responsible for Harmoush's destiny, because Harmoush was a refugee on their territory. They have to be honest about him. ...under international rules, any country that receives him has to protect him,"" al-Muqdad said. Al-Harmoush had called on all Syrian soldiers to defect and mobilize against al-Assad.  Eventually he fled Syria to Turkey. Two weeks ago, al-Muqdad called CNN in a panic, saying al-Harmoush had gone missing from the refugee camp in Turkey where he'd been living.  At the time, he suspected Syrian security agents had kidnapped the defecting officer. ""I talked to him on the morning of August 29th,"" al-Muqdad said. ""He said 'I have a meeting with a Turkish security man.  When I finish I will call you.'  I waited for three days and didn't hear from him.  Then after that we discovered that the security man took him and didn't send him back to the camp.  They sent him to Syria directly.  The Turks made a trick with Harmoush.  They caught him in Turkey and sent him to Syria."" The Syrian Arab News Agency said Syrian TV broadcast an interview or what it called a ""confession from al-Harmoush"" on Thursday night. Al-Harmoush said he defected because of bloody incidents, but he was not ordered to open fire on civilians. He said opposition members, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, contacted him while he was in Turkey.  He discussed talk of weapons and money. He said he didn't get the kind of support he was promised. The interview didn't indicate how he returned to Syria. Another Syrian activist, Omar Idilbi of the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said that from what Syrian TV is showing, there are signs that al-Harmoush has been tortured. CNN has previously asked the Turkish Foreign Ministry about al-Harmoush, but Turkish diplomats said they were not familiar with his case. Turkish Foreign Ministry officials were accompanying Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on a tour of Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. One official who requested anonymity told CNN the government ""on principle"" never hands over people who came to Turkey on humanitarian grounds. There are more than 7,600 Syrian refugees in six Turkish refugee camps and there is daily traffic back and forth across the borders. In Egypt, the first stop on the Turkish delegation's trip, Syrian activists tried to confront Erdgoan about al-Harmoush. When Erdogan emerged from the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo on Tuesday, a crowd of angry Syrian activists stood outside the gates chanting ""Erdogan coward"" and ""Erdogan, where is Harmoush?"" Erdogan waved to the crowd, apparently not understanding the question. But one Syrian activist cornered a senior Turkish official next to the government motorcade and demanded to know al-Harmoush's whereabouts. The Turkish official had no idea what he was talking about. Turkey is critical to the Syrian opposition movement.  Dissidents have fled to Turkey to escape the ongoing government crackdown in Syria and have been holding opposition meetings in Turkish cities. On Thursday, a Syrian opposition council is announcing its creation in Istanbul, the latest in a number of groups claiming to represent the opposition in Syria and abroad. But now, with Syria announcing it has al-Harmoush in custody, opposition activists said they feel betrayed by the Turkish government. ""I can't trust the Turks any more.  They are hypocrites,"" said al-Muqdad. ""There are a lot of questions that the Syrian government and the Turkish government should answer,"" said Idilbi, who is based in Beirut, Lebanon. The importance of al-Harmoush to the Syrian regime became evident September 8, when opposition activists and residents inside Syria called CNN to report Syrian security forces had attacked the village of Ibleen, where al-Harmoush's brother Mohammed lived. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a number of Syrian army defectors had taken shelter in Ibleen while awaiting the chance to smuggle themselves across the nearby border to Turkey. Video filmed of the aftermath of the Syrian government raid showed blood-spattered houses, burned-out cars and trucks, and a ransacked home. At least five people were killed in the raid, including al-Harmoush's brother.  His corpse was shown in another video released by opposition activists. Thousands of people attended his funeral. Syria's state news agency claimed responsibility for the raid on Ibleen, saying Syrian security forces had killed a number of ""armed terrorists"" who had been residing there. Violence continued Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said security forces killed one person and wounded five others in the Damascus countryside. A volunteer Red Crescent medic who was wounded in the western city of Homs last week has died of his injuries at a Lebanese hospital, the group said. Last month, al-Assad told the U.N. secretary general that military operations in the country had been halted. The regime has indicated that it wanted to end the fighting and foster stability. ""These promises have been broken promises,"" Ban said said Thursday.

"Tensions between Israel and Hamas ratcheted up Monday after the bodies of three Israeli teenagers, kidnapped this month, were found in the West Bank. Israel, in no uncertain terms, blames the disappearances and deaths on Hamas. ""Hamas will pay,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned against escalation, saying that if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."" The three bodies were found northwest of Hebron, according to the Israeli military, which said they were still in the process of being identified. The teens -- Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Frankel, a 16-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen -- disappeared late June 12 or early June 13 from the Jewish settlement of Gush Etzion in the West Bank, the military said. ""Although the identification has not been officially confirmed, I would like to send my support and condolences to the Shaar, Frankel and Yifrach families,"" Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon, with the Israel Defense Forces, told reporters. He vowed to pursue those responsible. ""The war on terror continues. It didn't begin now and it will not be over soon,"" Alon told reporters. ""We will do whatever it takes to deter Hamas and other terrorists and we'll continue to fight terror using every legal means at our disposal."" An aunt of one of the victims told CNN she was still in shock. ""I'm holding his picture and I see his smile,"" said Leehy Shaar, Gilad Shaar's aunt. ""He's so young and innocent ... It's just too sad to even imagine."" 'United in mourning' Netanyahu called an emergency security Cabinet meeting about the issue Monday. ""All Israel tonight is united in mourning the three teens who were brutally murdered by the Hamas terrorists,"" said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Prime Minister, stressing that Israel will ""continue to act against Hamas in order to protect our people."" ""Hamas says every Israeli man, woman and child, every civilian, is a legitimate target for these sort of terrorist attacks, so we're totally within our rights to protect ourselves against those Hamas terrorists who want to kill our people,"" Regev said. When asked whether he holds the Palestinian Authority responsible in any way for the teens' deaths, he responded: ""It's clear that the terrorists came from areas under Palestinian Authority control and returned to territories under Palestinian Authority control."" The spokesman urged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to annul his pact with Hamas. His comments were echoed by U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, chairman of the House Middle East and North Africa subcommittee; and Ted Deutch, D-Florida, ranking member of that subcommittee. ""We will continue to support the government of Israel in its efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice, and we offer the people of Israel our deepest and most heartfelt condolences as we grieve with them. If it is determined that Hamas is behind this horrific tragedy, Abu Mazen must immediately break up the unity agreement between Fatah and Hamas, a U.S. designated foreign terrorist organization,"" they said in a statetment. Abu Mazen is another name for Abbas, whose government now includes Hamas, which controls Gaza. Global outcry . Abbas called an emergency meeting of his own. The Palestinian leadership is expected to meet Tuesday to discuss the developments. U.S. President Barack Obama, Pope Francis and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were among world leaders condemning the killings Monday. ""As a father, I cannot imagine the indescribable pain that the parents of these teenage boys are experiencing. The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms this senseless act of terror against innocent youth,"" Obama said in a statement. He continued: ""From the outset, I have offered our full support to Israel and the Palestinian Authority to find the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice, and I encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to continue working together in that effort. I also urge all parties to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the situation."" Last week, the Israel Security Agency said it believed that two ""Hamas activists from Hebron"" were behind the teens' disappearances. It identified them as Marwan Qawasmeh, 29, and Amar Abu-Isa, 32. As Israeli media were reporting on the bodies' discovery Monday night, Israeli forces were blocking roads into Hebron, a city in the southern West Bank. Fighter jets could be heard flying low over Gaza. Overnight into Tuesday, more than 40 Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza, according to Palestinian security and medical sources. The strikes targeted Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups, the sources said. The Israeli military later said that forces had carried out strikes against 34 targets in Gaza, targeting terror infrastructure, after the firing of 18 rockets at Israel since Sunday evening. Within days after the teens disappeared, Israeli security forces conducted an extensive search for them and detained more than 150 Palestinian suspects. Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the kidnappings almost immediately. A Hamas spokesman said in the days after the abductions that the Prime Minister's comments attributing blame were ""stupid and baseless."" Also in the days after the abductions, the mother of one of the teenagers spoke to reporters. The three ""were just on their way home,"" said Naftali's mother, Racheli Frankel. ""We trust"" that they ""will be with us here, and we'll hug them soon.""","Israel carries out airstrikes against nearly three dozen targets in Gaza .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Monday spared I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby from prison, commuting the former White House aide's 30-month prison term. A conviction remains on Scooter Libby's record, and he must still pay a $250,000 fine. The prison time was imposed after a federal court convicted Libby of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative. A commutation is distinct from a pardon, which is a complete eradication of a conviction record and makes it the same as if the person has never been convicted. Bush has only commuted Libby's prison term, which means that the conviction remains on Libby's record and he must still pay a $250,000 fine. He will be on probation for two years. Commutations are rarely granted, says CNN's chief legal analyst, Jeffrey Toobin. A commutation is a total right of the president and it cannot be challenged by any attorney or court, he said. It's the fourth time Bush has issued one. Earlier Monday, a federal appeals court unanimously ruled that Libby could not delay serving his sentence, which would have put Libby just weeks away from surrendering to a prison. In a written statement commuting the prison sentence, issued hours after Monday's ruling, Bush called the sentence ""excessive,"" and suggested that Libby will pay a big enough price for his conviction.  Watch what signal critics say Bush's decision sends » . ""The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting,"" he said. The president, who has been under great pressure to pardon Libby, said Libby was given ""a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury."" Libby can still appeal his conviction. And if the appeal fails or is still in process at the end of Bush's term, the president could grant Libby a full pardon. Libby's conviction is linked to the investigation into the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame's identity. An outraged Joe Wilson, Plame's husband, spoke to CNN shortly after the ruling. Wilson had gone public with allegations that the Bush administration had ""twisted"" the evidence used to justify the invasion of Iraq, and prosecutors argued that Libby disclosed her employment as part of an effort to discredit him. ""I have nothing to say to Scooter Libby,"" Wilson said. ""I don't owe this administration. They owe my wife and my family an apology for having betrayed her. Scooter Libby is a traitor."" Libby was not accused of disclosing Plame's identity himself. But at trial, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald told the jury that Libby's actions left ""a cloud over the White House"" by obstructing the leak probe. In a statement issued Monday night, Fitzgerald took issue with Bush's description of the sentence as ""excessive,"" saying it was ""imposed pursuant to the laws governing sentencings which occur every day throughout this country."" ""It is fundamental to the rule of law that all citizens stand before the bar of justice as equals,"" Fitzgerald said. ""That principle guided the judge during both the trial and the sentencing."" Plame had worked in the CIA's counter-proliferation division before the March 2003 invasion. She told a congressional committee in March that her exposure effectively ended her career and endangered ""entire networks"" of agents overseas. Her husband said Bush's action today demonstrates that the White House is ""corrupt from top to bottom."" Clemency petitions are normally reviewed by the Justice Department, which investigates the case and seeks input from the federal prosecutor who brought the case before issuing a recommendation to the president. A government official said that Bush did not consult with the Justice Department before rendering his decision. Reaction on Capitol Hill was swift. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said the president had ""abandoned all sense of fairness when it comes to justice."" ""The president's commutation of Scooter Libby's prison sentence does not serve justice, condones criminal conduct, and is a betrayal of trust of the American people,"" she said. One of the few members of the GOP backing Bush, House Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri, said the commutation was ""the right thing to do."" ""The prison sentence was overly harsh, and the punishment did not fit the crime,"" Blunt said. Plame's name became public when Robert Novak named her in his column on July 14, 2003. Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has admitted he disclosed the information to a reporter. Novak pointed to another ""senior administration official"" -- Bush political adviser Karl Rove -- as the second source for his column. No one has been charged with leaking classified information in the case, but a jury found Libby guilty of trying to deceive investigators and a grand jury during the investigation. Bush was under great pressure to grant a pardon to Libby. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, is the highest-ranking White House official ordered to prison since the Iran-Contra affair. Polls suggest the American public may not be happy with Libby's commutation. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken in March asked if Bush should pardon Libby -- 69 percent said no, 18 percent said yes. Ted Wells, an attorney for Libby, issued a statement late Monday saying that Libby and his family ""wish to express their gratitude for the president's decision."" ""We continue to believe in Mr. Libby's innocence,"" Wells said. ""Scooter and his family appreciate the many Americans who have supported them over the last two years.""

"(CNN) -- For the second time in five months, a U.S. soldier from a Washington military base is accused of committing atrocities against civilians in Afghanistan. The unidentified soldier, an Army staff sergeant, is accused of firing on civilians, killing 16, in a house-to-house shooting rampage in two villages on Sunday, according to officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Shooting could affect U.S. military mission . He had been stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, a sprawling military installation between Tacoma and Olympia, Washington. A handful of soldiers from the base have been involved in violent incidents in the past few years, including four soldiers convicted of killing Afghan civilians in 2010 as part of a ""kill squad."" Also in 2010, three other soldiers ""suffered dangerous public mental breakdowns"" after returning from Afghanistan, with two of them shot to death by police, according to the Stars and Stripes military newspaper. This year, a former soldier from the base is believed to have shot a Washington park ranger to death on New Year's Day. Twelve soldiers on the base committed suicide in 2010, according to the base's Northwest Guardian newspaper. Last month, Army officials said the forensic psychiatric review process at the base's Madigan Army Medical Center was itself being reviewed. ""This was not just a rogue soldier,"" said Jorge Gonzalez, executive director of G.I. Voice, a veteran-run nonprofit organization that operates a soldiers' resource center near the base called Coffee Strong. The base is ""a rogue base, with a severe leadership problem,"" he said. ""If Fort Lewis was a college campus, it would have been closed down years ago,"" Gonzalez said. In the wake of Sunday's shootings, he called for a congressional investigation and hearings ""into the multiple crises"" at the base. Taliban vow revenge for shooting rampage . Others have expressed alarm as well. In December 2010, the Stars and Stripes military newspaper said the facility had gained a reputation as ""the most troubled base in the military."" It also reported that year that multiple investigations were under way into the conduct of troops at the base and the adequacy of the mental health and medical care soldiers were receiving upon their return home. Attempts to contact the base's public affairs office were not immediately successful Monday. In January, the body of Benjamin Colton Barnes, 24, was found face-down in a creek in Washington's Mount Rainier National Park after a manhunt. Barnes, who was assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord before his 2009 discharge, is believed to have fatally shot park ranger Margaret Anderson on New Year's Day. Police said Barnes was also wanted in connection with a shooting during a fight at a party in a Seattle suburb. That shooting took place before Anderson's death. While investigators said they had little insight into Barnes' mindset or motive, the woman with whom he was in a custody dispute said in court documents filed last year she was frightened to be in the same state with him. She wrote in other documents, reported by CNN affiliate KIRO, that Barnes might have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a deployment to Iraq. In November, Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs, also assigned to the base, was sentenced to life in military prison after a court-martial convicted him of murdering three Afghan civilians, cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as ""souvenirs"" and planting weapons on the bodies to make the men appear to be Taliban fighters killed in battle. Gibbs, who will be eligible for parole in 10 years, was the highest-ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue ""kill squad"" targeting civilians in 2010. Another seven were charged with lesser crimes, including abusing drugs, keeping ""off the books"" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier against speaking out against the killings. Murder and assault charges against one of those five soldiers were dropped last month, according to the Tacoma News-Tribune newspaper. Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. The platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with Afghans, who were wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead, prosecutors said, Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers plotted to murder civilians. ""The plan was to kill people,"" Army Spc. Jeremy Morlock, who was among those charged in the deaths, said in court in March 2011 after his guilty plea. ""There was a group of soldiers in the 5th Brigade numbering in the single digits who did not behave with honor,"" Col. Barry Huggins of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, who supervised the courts-martial, said last month in his first public remarks about the case, according to the News-Tribune. ""Justice was served in a timely manner. We should not make the mistake of assuming those soldiers represent all soldiers."" The 5th Brigade has been renamed the 2nd Brigade, according to the News-Tribune. Last month, two doctors at Madigan Army Medical Center were removed from clinical duties and assigned to administrative work, the Seattle Times newspaper reported, citing Army Medical Command officials. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray told the Times that the two included Dr. William Keppler, a retired Army officer who leads a forensic psychiatric team responsible for assessing the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses of soldiers under consideration for medical retirement. Army Medical Command told the Times it has ""initiated a top-to-bottom review of the process associated with the forensic psychiatric reviews conducted at Madigan Army Medical Center."" A diagnosis of PTSD qualifies a soldier for medical retirement and benefits. The investigation was triggered in part by concerns that Madigan doctors involved in the screening process were ""unduly influenced by worries about the escalating costs of paying benefits,"" the Seattle Times reported last week. Complaints from soldiers previously diagnosed with PTSD but later accused of exaggerating their symptoms also prompted the probe, according to the newspaper. Some 285 soldiers who were evaluated at Madigan since 2007 will be asked to undergo a second evaluation, Western Regional Medical Command, which oversees the medical center, said in a statement last week. Joint Base Lewis-McChord was formed in 2010 by the merger of Fort Lewis, an Army post, and McChord Air Force Base. At 415,000 acres, it is the largest on the U.S. West Coast, according to its website, with tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel and their families. The primary unit on Fort Lewis is the Army's I Corps, according to the website, and the primary unit on McChord Air Force Base is the U.S. Air Force's 62nd Airlift Wing. In addition, the joint base houses ""more than 30 different units from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Reserve and National Guard and Department of Defense agencies,"" the site says. The suspect in Sunday's shootings acted alone and turned himself in after the incident, according to ISAF officials. A U.S. military official, who asked not to be named because of the pending investigation, said the suspect is in his mid-30s and has served several tours in Iraq, although this was his first deployment to Afghanistan. The incident shocked U.S. officials and prompted outrage in Afghanistan and has fueled fears of intensified anger against U.S. troops in Afghanistan that erupted in deadly riots last month over the inadvertent burning of Qurans by American troops. The soldier accused in Sunday's deaths remained in U.S. custody on Monday as investigators try to determine his motive, including examining his mental stability and medical history.","Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldiers have been involved in several violent incidents .

"(CNN) -- Actor Edward Norton already wanted to be in better shape for his 40th birthday than he was on his 30th when the idea hit -- why not join members of an African tribe famous for its runners and run the New York marathon? ""Incredible Hulk"" star Edward Norton, second from left, has trained for a marathon with Maasai tribesmen in Kenya . Before he knew it, the star of ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Fight Club"" had signed on to the effort, despite never having run a marathon before. ""The idea picked up traction pretty quickly,"" said Norton, who turned 39 in August. ""Then, I was like, 'Wait a minute. What have I just done?'"" The run is a benefit for the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust, an organization working to promote sustainable development while protecting the east African grasslands that the Maasai tribe calls home. Both the traditional tribe's way of life and its environment have been threatened by rapid industrial development. Norton discovered, and became a supporter of, the trust about 10 years ago during his first visit to Kenya, where he met founder Luca Belpietro. ""I was impressed at the way he was really genuinely working with the community to create value out of being good stewards of the land,"" Norton said. Belpietro will be one of nearly 30 runners joining Norton on the Nov. 1 marathon. Also running will be magician David Blaine and three Maasai tribesmen. The Maasai are at the heart of Kenya's long tradition of distance running. Norton said one of the runners, safari guide Parashi Ntanin, is so fast he could probably leave the rest of the group behind and run the race in less than 2½ hours. Norton said he's run as much as 15 miles twice during his training for the 26.2-mile marathon and that despite some leg and knee pains, he's confident he'll finish the endurance race. ""I'm really enjoying it,"" he said after a workout Wednesday in New York. ""I'm enjoying having a goal."" A competitive rower at Yale, Norton said he's experienced the so-called ""runner's high"" during his training, which fans can follow on his Twitter account, @EdwardNorton. ""Running in the park, I got a taste of what people say about the New York marathon. There were people of every shape and size out there,"" he said. ""I really got a lift out of it.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department has issued a travel alert warning U.S. citizens in South Africa to be aware of increased terrorism risks during the World Cup, which starts June 11. ""Large scale public events like the World Cup may present a wide range of attractive targets for terrorists,"" the alert said. ""There is a heightened risk that extremist groups will conduct terrorist acts within South Africa in the near future."" However, the State Department said, there was no specific information on any threat. Any credible threats will be conveyed to the public, the alert said, urging all U.S. citizens to register with the embassy in South Africa to enable them to get updated security information.

"The raspy, gruff voice behind some of the most soulful songs of the past six decades is now gone. Legendary soul singer Bobby Womack died Friday, Womack's publicist said. He was 70. ""I am sadly able to confirm but I have no details at this time,"" said Sonya Kolowrat, his publicist with XL Recordings. Womack, whose career started before he was 10, wrote and performed hits such as ""That's the Way I feel About Cha"" and ""Across 110th Street."" He also wrote The Rolling Stones' first U.S. No. 1 hit, ""It's All Over Now."" Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Last year, he revealed to BBC 6 music that he had early signs of Alzheimer's disease. ""With the support of many good doctors, my family, and all of my wonderful fans, I will continue to write and perform and bring the good music to the people for as long as I can,"" Womack told CNN after his diagnosis. He thanked his fans for their prayers and well wishes, adding, ""I truly appreciate and can feel your love."" Womack's diagnosis came after several other health issues including pneumonia, diabetes, and colon cancer. The evolution of a legend . Bobby Dwayne Womack was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1944. His father, a steelworker, also sang gospel -- and young Bobby followed in his father's musical footsteps. ""We came up very poor. My kids have had a much better life than I'd ever thought of livin',"" Womack said on his website. By age 10, Womack and his four brothers -- Friendly Jr., Cecil, Harry and Curtis -- formed The Womack Brothers. They started touring the gospel circuit. Then came an encounter that would change the course of the group. In 1953, The Womack Brothers met Soul Stirrers lead singer Sam Cooke. After The Womack Brothers changed their name to the Valentinos, Cooke signed them to his SAR Records label, and the Valentinos' success took off with the hit ""Lookin' for a Love."" ""Sam had charisma and a very special way to get into people's hearts through his songs and his music,"" Womack said in the book ""Midnight Mover."" ""But Sam wasn't just a singer, he was a leader, and he was getting ready to shake things up, to raise the consciousness of the world and stop prejudice."" But in 1964, Cooke was shot to death at a Los Angeles motel. Four months later, Womack married Cooke's widow. That same year, The Rolling Stones covered Womack's ""It's All Over Now"" -- and scored their first No. 1 hit in the United States. And Womack became rich. He broke off into a solo career, which took off in 1967 with his first song ""Trust Me."" His song ""Across 110th Street"" became a hit in 1972 and rode a new wave of popularity in 1997 when it was featured in the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's film ""Jackie Brown."" Mourning an icon . Decades after The Rolling Stones made it big with Womack's song, guitarist Ronnie Wood recalled his friend's ability to captivate his audiences. ""I'm so sad to hear about my friend Bobby Womack -- the man who could make you cry when he sang has brought tears to my eyes with his passing,"" Wood tweeted. ""My heart goes out to his family & friends and everyone who loved his music. Bobby you will be greatly missed."" Singer Darius Rucker also remembered Womack's renowned baritone voice. ""To the great Bobby Womack. Rest In Peace u legend,"" Rucker tweeted. ""Heaven just got another great singer for its choir.""","Womack dies at 70; his publicist reveals no other details .

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee has reinstated India, allowing its athletes to once again compete under their country's flag after a ban of more than a year. The reinstatement raises to 89 the number of countries and territories participating in the Sochi Games. ""It is the first time in Olympic history that a suspension of an NOC (National Olympic Committee) has been lifted during an Olympic Games,"" the IOC said in a statement Tuesday. The decision means that Indian athletes can now compete for India's Olympic committee and walk behind their national flag at the closing ceremony of the Winter Games in Sochi on 23 February, the statement said. At the opening ceremony last week, India's delegation of three athletes had marched under an IOC flag. India was suspended from the Olympic fold in December 2012 after the Indian Olympic Association elected Lalit Bhanot, who spent 11 months in jail on corruption charges, to a top post. The situation remained deadlocked for months, as the Indian association refused to bow to the IOC's demands for changes. But the IOC said Tuesday that it had ended the suspension following the Indian association's general assembly and elections for a new board on Sunday. An IOC delegation that observed the elections reported that they complied with the requirement that ""no person convicted or charge-framed can run for a position within the organization."" Narayna Ramachandran, the president of the World Squash Federation, was voted in as the new president of the Indian association. ""To symbolically mark the lifting of the suspension and in recognition of the three Indian athletes competing in Sochi, the Indian flag will be raised in the Olympic Village,"" the IOC said Tuesday. India responded positively to the announcement. ""I am happy that suspension is over and now Indian teams and players will take part in the International events under the national flag,"" said Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the former acting president of Indian Olympic Association. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.","It's the first time a ban of a national committee has been lifted during an Olympics .

"(CNN) -- A Chicago couple never planned to turn their trip to Cambodia into a mission to help educate girls. But that's exactly what happened. Bill and Lauren Smith had traveled to the Southeast Asian country often. During a 2002 visit, a taxi driver asked the Smiths if they wanted to see ""the children."" Not really knowing what he meant, they agreed. The driver took them about 25 minutes outside the capital of Phnom Penh. On their arrival, they saw hundreds of people on giant mountains of garbage. ""There were flies everywhere,"" Bill said. ""There were snakes and rats and the stench; you were just gagging."" His wife added, ""I had to breathe through my mouth not to smell it."" But they said they were most shocked by all the young children going through the garbage. These kids were scavenging for metal, plastic, glass and anything else they could sell to a recycler to make money. Each child would make about $10 a month at the dump to help out their families, Bill said. A photographer for Chicago sports teams including the Bears and Blackhawks, Bill started snapping pictures of the dump. But the experience haunted him and his wife. ""We were just tourists,"" he said. ""But we thought we could help one person."" They came back the next day and decided to focus on a child to save from the dump. One girl stuck out in Lauren's mind, she said. ""I remember seeing this little girl with the red hat. And I don't know if it was the red hat or it was her eyes ... these big eyes (that) ... just looked kind of hopeless."" Through their driver, who spoke some English, they found out the girl's name was Sreyna. They drove her home to talk to her mother about a way to get the 10-year-old out of the dump and into school. When they arrived, they met her sister Salim, 12, and decided they would help them both. They made a deal with the girls' mother. ""We're going to pay you whatever they would make at the dump,"" Bill recalled telling the mother. ""We're going to make sure you have food at the table, and in exchange for this you have to promise us that you'll make sure they go to school every day. You'll make sure they stay in school, and you'll make sure they never go to the dump again."" The mother agreed, and the Smiths gave their trusted driver money to fund the plan for the girls for the next six months. The couple also found two other girls they decided to sponsor during their trip. Returning home to Chicago, the Smiths showed their photos to friends and family and told them what they were doing with the girls. Many decided they wanted to help, too, and gave the Smiths money to fund more children. Bill also started doing fund-raisers with a slide show called ""From the Sports World to the Third World."" He would show his photos of the sports teams he covered and then scenes of orphanages, landmine survivors and the children at the dump in Cambodia. ""By now, the whole room's in tears,"" Bill recalled. A newspaper wrote an article about what the Smiths were doing, and soon they were getting donations from all over the country. They ended up starting a nonprofit organization called A New Day Cambodia. Today, the organization has two centers where they house about 100 girls and boys. And the concept is the same as it was from the start. The group pays the parents what their children would make at the dump in exchange for the kids going to school. And these efforts are paying off. Today, the sisters the Smiths initially helped are attending Harold Washington College in Chicago. Sreyna is studying hospitality, with hopes of working in the hotel and restaurant industry. Salim is studying English and wants to become a teacher. Over the years, they became close to the Smiths, spending a lot of time together traveling. Salim says she feels like they are her second family. Without the Smiths and an education, it's hard to say where the two girls would be now. ""Education is really important to me personally, because I see it as a bridge,"" Sreyna says, adding, ""Education to me is like a second life.""

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- A prominent leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine resigned his post Thursday as fighting flared there, with militants reportedly downing a Ukrainian military plane. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, told reporters he was stepping down and handing over power to Alexander Zakharchenko, a little-known militia commander. As Ukrainian forces rapidly advance toward the key rebel-controlled city and Russia builds up forces along the border, the sudden resignation leaves a number of questions about the volatile region's future unanswered: What does it mean? Are militants disbanding and vanishing into the night? Is there a brutal battle ahead? Borodai, a Russian citizen who rose to power as pro-Russian rebels took portions of eastern Ukraine earlier this year, was a prominent public face for the separatists after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed last month. He gave little reason for his resignation Thursday, other than saying he considered the job of founding the republic to be finished and that it was time for a Ukrainian to take the reins. The announcement came after days of assault on rebel positions near Donetsk by Ukrainian forces. Shelling in the Donetsk area, which could be heard periodically in and around the city, killed four civilians and injured 18 others on Thursday, local officials said. About 25 miles to the northeast, rebels shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 near the town of Yenakievo on Thursday evening, Ukrainian military spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said. Initial information indicates that a missile from a Russian-made surface-to-air antiaircraft system, called Buk or SA-11, shot the plane, Seleznyov said. Information about the fate of the pilot wasn't immediately available. That's the same type of missile system that U.S. and Ukrainian officials have alleged downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine last month, killing all 298 people on board. U.S. officials have concluded the missile was fired from rebel-held territory. Rebel leaders and Russia, which Western nations have accused of supplying the rebels in the months-long fighting, deny involvement. The ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to U.N. officials. The battles also have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia. NATO warns Russia . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned Russia Thursday that any further intervention in Ukraine ""would lead to further isolation"" and ""deeper, more profound, tougher economic sanctions that would really hurt the Russian economy."" Rasmussen told reporters in Kiev he hopes that Russia, which according to NATO has 20,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, ""steps back because it wouldn't be in Russia's interest to intervene further."" Russia has denied allegations that it's supporting separatists in Ukraine and maintains that it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of saying one thing while doing another -- building up troops along the border and continuing to send support to pro-Russian separatists. MH17 search efforts halted . The fighting also prompted an international team of experts, led by the Netherlands, to suspend its efforts to search the MH17 debris sites for remaining human remains amid fierce fighting in the area. The experts said the area wasn't safe to search, citing intensified battles in the area. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters Wednesday that search teams plan to return to the plane crash site. But he didn't give a date for when that might happen. ""We have done what we could do in the current conditions,"" Rutte said. ""Everyone will agree with us that we should not expose our people to unnecessary risk."" Ukraine's government said Thursday that it was scrapping a cease-fire around the crash site -- put in place to enable the team's work -- until their mission restarts. In a statement on the Cabinet website, it accused the rebels of provocations and of putting the experts' lives at risk. The statement from Ukraine's Cabinet said at least three more zones where debris lies scattered remain unexamined. The experts plan to discuss when the next stage of the search operation might begin shortly, it said. Until the decision is made, most will leave Ukraine, but coordination and communication teams will stay. Search for MH17 victims halted for now . What is Putin's endgame in Ukraine?

"New York (CNN) -- Every year Debra Keller would take her granddaughters to New York City to take in the holiday traditions -- going to a show, having lunch at their favorite restaurants, shopping and a visit to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. This year when they visit Rockefeller Center, it will be their own tree. The 74-foot tall Norway spruce that once provided a shade and a scenic sight on their lawn in Pennsylvania will become the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree for 2011. ""To be honest it won't be sad to see the tree go,"" said Keller, 56, in a statement. ""We just feel honored that the tree was chosen and will be enjoyed by so many people when it's sitting in the middle of Rockefeller Center."" The iconic Christmas tree is expected to arrive on a flatbed truck Friday morning and will grace Rockefeller Center in Manhattan when it's officially erected at the end of November. The Norway spruce weighing approximately 10 tons was cut down Wednesday morning in Mifflinville, Pennsylvania, and hoisted by a huge crane onto a 115-foot-long trailer where it will be driven to Manhattan. The 46-foot-wide tree will be raised at Rockefeller Center Friday morning. The tree, which is approximately 75 years old, was first spotted by the Rockefeller Center team during a routine drive down Interstate-80. Rockefeller Center's head gardener saw the tree out of the corner of his eye from the driver's seat. The tree made an immediate impression standing tall on the lawn of Debra Keller's 79 year-old mother Nancy's house where she has lived since 1969. When the tree is finally decorated for its tree lighting November 30th, it will hold 30,000 multi-colored lights on five miles of wire and will be topped with a Swarovski crystal star, adorned with 25,000 crystals and one million facets. The first tree was erected in 1931 by construction workers developing Rockefeller Center. The first formal Rockefeller Center tree lighting ceremony was held in 1933 and was decked with 700 lights in front of the then eight-month-old RCA building.","Tree is a 74-foot tall Norway spruce .

"(CNN) -- The New Orleans Saints admitted Tuesday to paying bonuses for hits that would knock opposing players out of a game, vowing the practice won't be repeated. Saints Head Coach Sean Payton and General Manager Mickey Loomis said they take ""full responsibility"" for the practice, which they said ""happened under our watch."" ""These are serious violations, and we understand the negative impact it has had on our game,"" Loomis and Payton said in a statement issued Tuesday evening. ""Both of us have made it clear within our organization that this will never happen again, and make that same promise to the NFL and most importantly to all of our fans."" Opinion: 'Bounty' system stemmed from fans' lust for violence . The National Football League reported Friday that the Saints paid defensive players a bounty for injuring opponents, as well as making interceptions and fumble recoveries, during the 2009-2011 seasons. The program involved as many as 27 players and at least one assistant coach, the league concluded. The league said the program was administered by then-defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, with knowledge of other coaches. Players regularly contributed cash to a pool, which may have topped $50,000 at its peak. The players were paid $1,500 for a ""knockout,"" when an opposing player was not able to return to the game, and $1,000 for a ""cart-off,"" when an opposing player had to be carried off the field. In some cases, particular players on the opposing team were targeted, the NFL said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has received the results of the investigation and will decide on discipline, which could include fines, suspensions and forfeiture of draft choices. Saints owner Tom Benson said Monday the team cooperated with investigation and called the findings ""troubling."" In their statement, Payton and Loomis said they were sorry for the ""undue hardship"" the violations had caused Benson, ""who had nothing to do with this activity."" In a statement released Friday, Williams called the bounties ""a terrible mistake"" that he knew was wrong. ""Instead of getting caught up in it, I should have stopped it,"" Williams, now a defensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams, said in a statement quoted by the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper. ""I take full responsibility for my role. I am truly sorry. I have learned a hard lesson, and I guarantee that I will never participate in or allow this kind of activity to happen again."" The disclosure has ignited controversy among football fans nationwide -- and Tuesday, former NBA star Charles Barkley said he had taken part in a bounty program during his basketball playing days in the 1980s. Barkley, now a commentator for CNN sister network TNT, said in an online interview that he had called on teammates to knock out an opposing player whose team was beating Barkley's Philadelphia 76ers by a 30-point margin. He put the bounty amount at $5,000 but would not identify the player or opposing team. ""We were getting beat by 30 or 40, I can't remember,"" he told interviewer Dan Patrick. ""This guy was shooting threes and running up and down the court. I said, 'Hey, we've got to hurt that guy right there.' "" Barkley added that ""people are clearly going to overreact to the bounty thing,"" which he said should have stayed among the players. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Saints leaders apologize to the team's owner for ""undue hardship""

"(CNN) -- As a jockey he spent his career guiding horses over the world's toughest fences. But this -- standing in a ditch in a Guatemalan town with a young boy in a ragged rodeo outfit holding the reins of his blind pony -- is an altogether different assignment for Richard Dunwooody. The boy is the son of the local rag-and-bone man, who collects unwanted items and sells them to merchants. Dunwoody is there to take pictures for The Brooke, a UK-based animal charity, in his new career as a photographer. It's in stark contrast to 27 years ago when he burst onto the horse-racing scene aged 22, riding West Tip to victory in Britain's Grand National, a grueling jumps test widely regarded as the hardest and most spectacular event of its kind. Dunwoody, who turned 50 in January, may have stepped out of the saddle some years ago but horse racing still drives his passion and thinking in this relatively new-found career. He was advised by his doctor to give up the racetrack because of the dangers to his already damaged neck should he fall heavily again. ""It's a bit like a quote from my friend Tony McCoy (the 18-time champion jockey with over 4,000 wins to his name) who likes to say whatever you do, if you're riding a winner, remember you might not ride another one,"" Dunwoody told CNN. ""It's the same with photographs. You take a good image and then it's on to the next one. ""I think that horse-racing mentality I had while riding translates well to acting as a driving factor in photography."" The career path from saddle to camera lens is not a well-traveled route, but photography has always been a passion for Dunwoody. ""At school, I was always in the dark room and doing stuff like that,"" he recalls of his youth in Northern Ireland. ""Then during my career I had a lot of friends who were racecourse photographers and sports photographers, so I got more interested then."" After retiring he started heading up riding holidays for travel company Wild Frontiers, which took him on trips around the globe for five or six years. He featured in ""Strictly Come Dancing"" -- the British TV show that spawned ""Dancing with the Stars"" globally -- walked 1,000 miles in 1,000 hours for charity, and retraced the steps of explorer Ernest Shackleton as part of a 48-hour trek to reach the South Pole. ""After all that, I felt I wanted to get about more but wondered what would enable me to do that,"" he adds. ""I thought taking photographs might be a good way of combining the two."" So, he signed up to a nine-month course at the Speos Photographic Institute in Paris specializing in photojournalism, which he says ""really taught me a hell of a lot."" Asked if he has always had a natural eye, he says laughing, ""I wouldn't say that!"" But he has produced a gallery's worth of eye-catching photographs from his various trips, not least of all his first exhibition in January for The Brooke. The charity wanted to highlight its work and the plight of suffering animals by sending Dunwoody to some of the 10 countries where it has projects. ""I was quite surprised how well it was received,"" he says of the exhibition. ""You don't really know how you are, you can never gauge yourself, it's how the images are received by other people. I'm just stumbling around trying to make a living from this."" One memorable trip was to Afghanistan in October, which Dunwoody made independently from the charity. ""I always felt safe there, but you never know,"" he says. ""There was a restaurant we frequented a fair bit while we were there which was blown up by a suicide bomber last month. It makes you think, doesn't it? It's very sad what's happening there but I loved it as a country -- it's a fantastic place really."" Other assignments have included covering the Mongol Derby -- an energy-sapping 1,000-kilometer horse race -- trips to the brick kilns in Cairo to watch children work, slate mines in India and a visit to Antigua, a city perched in the highlands of Guatemala. There are further photographic trips planned, notably one to Japan later this year, and he hankers for a return to the Arctic and Antarctic. ""I went there before I'd done my course but it's just the most beautiful place to take photographs,"" he says. ""We came across a polar bear which I caught on my tiny ready-to-shoot camera, and the pics were OK. I'd like to go back with proper equipment."" Dunwoody, whose time is split between London and living with his girlfriend near Ronda in Spain, still can't believe he has gradually forged a second career for himself from his passion. As for his former colleagues, he has no idea what they make of his photographs -- ""when I see them we never really talk about that"" -- and he is too modest to rate his own photographs. ""I'm happy with one or two of my photographs but it's not up to me to say, that's for other people,"" says Dunwoody, who concedes he is best at action shots. ""I'm just very grateful for this chance and the places it takes me."" So what makes a good photo? ""I've had a few lectures on this subject from some top photographers,"" he says. ""It has to be a good moment, a defining moment, something that makes you look twice, as there are so many images out there now. It's hard to get one of those eye-catching shots. ""In fact, photographs are a lot harder work than they are given credit for, certainly than I used to give credit for. I have an immense amount of respect for photographers."" But he is certainly happy in his new life, which has taken him from in front of the lens to behind it. ""I prefer taking photos of horses than being on them,"" he says. ""Certainly at the Mongol Derby, where the ponies rear up and it's all a bit crazy. This is more sane.""","Ex-jockey Richard Dunwoody swaps saddle for photographic snapshots around the world .

"(CNN) -- You've probably heard that the Turkish government's attempt to ban Twitter quickly collapsed into farce. From USA Today: . ""More than 2.5 million tweets -- or over 17,000 per minute -- were reportedly posted (from Turkey) in the first 24 hours after the ban, according to several media reports. HootSuite, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup that measures and analyzes Twitter marketing campaigns, said in a corporate blog post that its traffic from Turkey tripled in the first day after the ban. So ... all is good, right? Not right. Turkey is a NATO ally, a candidate for membership in the European Union, a front-line state facing Iran, Syria and Russia -- and it is heading seriously in the wrong direction. A lot of people have invested a lot of time and effort denying that unwelcome news. It can be denied no longer. Turkey's Twitter-banning prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, came to power after a big election win in 2002. Erdogan's party was staunchly Islamic, yet seemingly committed to electoral democracy. Its victory was hailed by many as a hopeful sign for the post-9/11 world. Europe had Christian Democratic parties; why couldn't Turkey have a Muslim Democratic party? Indeed, Erdogan-style Muslim Democracy seemed a decade ago the striking alternative to radical Islamism, a political alternative that would integrate religion into politics while preserving individual freedom and democratic decision-making. Erdogan and his Islamic regime lifted restrictions on the wearing of hijab in public buildings. He abolished the daily pledge of allegiance to a secular Turkey required in all Turkish schools since 1933. He downgraded the longstanding Turkish relationship with Israel and mused instead about a ""neo-Ottoman"" role for Turkey at the head of the Middle East's Muslim nations. He and his party passed restrictions on the sale and promotion of alcohol and boldly disavowed the equality of the sexes. At the same time, the Erdogan government did initiate important economic liberation of Turkey's traditionally state-led economy. He made concessions to ethnic and religious minorities. It seemed imaginable that Erdogan's reactionary religious message could somehow be fused with modern economics and tolerance. President Barack Obama certainly imagined so: In a 2012 interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, the President cited Prime Minister Erdogan as one of the five foreign leaders with whom he'd forged his closest ""bonds of trust"". Yet from the start, Erdogan's Islamic democracy had a strongly authoritarian whiff to it. Through the Erdogan years, Turkey has led the world in the number of journalists jailed, ahead of both China and Iran. Erdogan's government banned YouTube for two years beginning in 2007, purged and jailed hundreds of politically uncongenial military officers and reshaped both police and the judiciary. Turkish voters overlooked and forgave these infringements. They elected and twice re-elected Erdogan. Turkey achieved genuine economic progress during his rule. Ordinary Turks believed that their blunt, traditionalist prime minister cherished their interests in a way his more cosmopolitan predecessors did not. Then came the swirl of corruption rumors, corruption on a massive multi-billion dollar scale. Police fired tear gas and water cannon at people protesting the death of a 15-year-old boy who died in demonstrations against development of Gezi Park in central Istanbul. Audio was posted to social media that purported to reveal the prime minister in plots with his son to collect and conceal tens of millions of Euros in illegal cash. (Erdogan has claimed that a corruption investigation that entangled four of his former cabinet ministers is a ""coup plot"" and that some of the recordings are ""immorally edited material"".) Erdogan has responded with more censorship and more controls, culminating in the Twitter ban. That ban failed -- yet the underlying problem remains: the country that was once the West's most reliable partner in the Islamic world is not so reliable any more. Turkey defies embargoes to trade with Iran. Turkish foreign policy has sought to build relationships with everyone and anyone except Turkey's traditional Western partners: with Syria, China, Russia, anyone. With Russia's seizure of Crimea, the once-exotic and once-remote Black Sea region has suddenly emerged as a central global zone of conflict. Time was when the United States and the Western world could count on a steady, responsible and democratizing ally on the south shore of that sea. No more. The Twitter ban has collapsed. All the bad impulses that imposed that Twitter ban remain in place -- and will remain so long as Erdogan remains in office. The promise of an Islamic version of Christian Democracy has proved a big lie. Instead, the country that was once the most stable, reliable and democratic state in the Islamic world seems now to have cast itself as the region's saddest backward-slider -- with its ever more authoritarian leader playing the role of an Islamic Vladimir Putin, or maybe Eva Peron. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Turkey once gave people hope for the future of democracy in Islamic nations .

"(CNN) -- A year to the day after racially abusing an opponent, John Terry stepped out as Chelsea captain wearing an anti-racism armband -- only for the Blues to suffer their first Champions League defeat since winning the trophy in May. Terry wore the band as part of a week of action organized by the group 'Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare)', which has asked all club captains in European competition to help its campaign. The 31-year-old is currently serving a domestic ban after being found guilty of racial abuse against Anton Ferdinand by the English FA -- but his suspension does not apply to European football, where Chelsea were subjected to a torrid time by Shakhtar Donetsk. Read: Terry waives FA racism appeal . Unbeaten over the last 11 months, the Ukrainian champions won 2-1 after Alex Teixeira gave the hosts the perfect start with a goal after three minutes as the ball ricocheted off Terry into his path. Shakhtar would have added to their lead but for some fine goalkeeping from Petr Cech and had to wait until the 52nd minute before Fernandinho rewarded their dominance with a deserved second goal. Late on, Oscar became the third Brazilian to score in the European tie but his close-range strike was too little too late as Chelsea lost their first Champions League game since going down 3-1 in Italy against Napoli in February. ""Perhaps it was one of our best games in recent times,"" Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu told the official website of European body UEFA. ""And I have to say that this Chelsea side are stronger than the one that won the Champions League last season. That makes our victory even more important."" Chelsea stay second in Group E after two-time winners Juventus could only draw 1-1 at the Danish home of tournament new boys Nordsjaelland. Elsewhere, Barcelona and Manchester United both came from behind as they struggled to beat less fancied opposition despite boasting home advantage. Deprived of some key personnel in defense, Barca were stunned when Scottish visitors Celtic took the lead through Giorgios Samaras' deflected header -- only for Andres Iniesta to draw the four-time champions level just before the break with a fine goal. After outstanding Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster thought he had done enough to repel the home side's best efforts, Barcelona secured their 100th Champions League win when Jordi Alba found the net four minutes into stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win. In England, Manchester United were equally surprised as Brazil's Alan gave Portugal's Braga a two-goal lead within 20 minutes inside a shocked Old Trafford. Mexican striker Javier Hernandez made the most of a rare start as he reduced the deficit shortly moments later, before wrapping up the win 15 minutes from time after Jonny Evans had scrambled home an equaliser shortly after the hour. ""It's been the story of our season at home -- start badly, lose goals and have to fight back to rescue games,"" said United coach Alex Ferguson after the 3-2 victory. ""Some of our football was fantastic but conceding so many goals is a concern."" Elsewhere, Spartak Moscow won their first match and points in Group G, beating Portuguese side Benfica 2-1 in Russia to trail Barca by six points and Celtic by just one. Spaniards Valencia were the biggest winners of the night, winning 3-0 in Belarus to bring home side Bate Borisov -- who stunned Bayern Munich 3-1 in their last European game -- back down to earth. Meanwhile, the Germans, who were beaten runners-up on home soil against Chelsea in the final in May, rebounded in solid if unconvincing fashion when winning 1-0 at French side Lille. Galatasaray could not profit from playing against a CFR Cluj side reduced to ten men for over an hour as the Turks conceded an own goal and missed a penalty before equalizing late on to draw 1-1.","Shakhtar Donetsk inflict first Champions League defeat on Chelsea since the English side's triumph in May .

"DOVER, Delaware (CNN) -- It was a very public goodbye for Joe Biden on Friday as the Delaware senator addressed the deployment ceremony of his son's National Guard unit as they prepare to leave for a tour of duty in Iraq. Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden addresses the deployment ceremony Friday. Following Thursday night's debate with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in St. Louis, Missouri, Biden flew back to Delaware to spend the day with his 39-year-old son before his deployment to Iraq. Beau Biden -- a captain in the National Guard and Delaware's attorney general -- will be a trial counselor in the 261st Signal Brigade, a unit that specializes in providing communications for the military in Iraq. ""I've come here many times before as a Delawarean, as a United States senator,"" he told a crowd in Dover. ""But today I come, as you prepare to deploy, as a father -- a father who had some sage advice from his son this morning: 'Dad, keep it short, we're in formation.' "" ""My heart is full of love and pride. ... You are the best demonstration of both our nation's greatness and ... our people's goodness,"" he added.  Watch more of Biden's comments » . Biden joined the rest of Delaware's congressional delegation and the state's Gov. Ruth Ann Minner in speaking to the 110 members of the unit. ""Let me simply say, thank you, thank you for answering the call of your country. ... So stay strong, stand together, serve honorably ... may God bless you and may he protect you,"" Biden added, later saluting the crowd. Beau Biden doesn't ship out right away. Instead, he heads to Fort Bliss, Texas, this weekend, where his National Guard unit completes assigned tasks and receives additional training specific to the conditions in Iraq. Then, in six to eight weeks, they ship out to Iraq. Despite increased interest and security because Biden is now a vice presidential nominee, the public affairs officer for the unit had insisted the ceremony would be no different, and not political. Lt. Col. Len Grattieri said Wednesday that the last time Biden -- who has often spoken at deployment ceremonies -- addressed a departing unit was 18 months ago, and that he usually roots his remarks in foreign policy, offering his perspective on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Grattieri couldn't say where Beau Biden will be based, but his role will be that of a prosecutor enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice. He added that positions aren't clearly defined, and the unit will do whatever the Army needs it to. In the past week, Biden had been trying to balance debate prep with family time. On Tuesday afternoon, he took a break and went out to lunch with Beau, Beau's wife, Hallie, and the couple's young daughter. Aides say it's been a tough week for Biden, with Beau's departure weighing on him. Biden said in an interview Tuesday that he is proud of his son, but wishes he weren't going. Palin, along with Biden, brought up their respective sons' deployment to Iraq during the debate. Palin's son Track, 19, an infantry soldier, was deployed to Iraq with his Army unit September 11. Palin spoke at her eldest son's deployment ceremony in Alaska, which honored the 4,000 Alaska-based troops to be deployed from Fort Wainwright to Iraq in the coming weeks. Track Palin, who was standing in formation among members of the 1st Stryker Brigade's 25th Infantry Division at Fort Wainwright, went unmentioned by the governor in her brief remarks. Palin had agreed to speak at the deployment ceremony several months ago, before she was tapped as Sen. John McCain's running mate. Though the speech wasn't a political event -- media credentials were issued by the military base -- that didn't stop dozens of national reporters and photographers from descending on the military base in Fairbanks, home to nearly 12,000 soldiers and their families. ""As you depart today,"" Palin told the infantrymen, ""don't mind us -- your parents, your friends, your family -- if we allow for a few tears, or if we hold you just a little close once more before you're gone. Because were going to miss you. We can't help it. We are going to miss you."" Palin said victory in Iraq is ""within sight."" ""You and others like you will be there to see the mission through,"" she said. ""You will be there to win. You will see victory. Track Palin signed up to join the Army on September 11, 2007. During his 12-month deployment, his unit will protect reconstruction teams that are rebuilding the country, said Maj. Chris Hyde, the public affairs officer for the brigade. Hyde, who called Track Palin ""a low-profile individual,"" said he had not heard any security concerns about having the son of a prominent political figure in the brigade. ""The decision to put him in that role was made before Gov. Palin was picked by McCain,"" he said. ""If anything comes down from headquarters, we will comply, but I wouldn't even want to speculate. I wouldn't say yes or no. That's just my opinion. We will do well with Track Palin whether he's there or he's not."" CNN's Peter Hamby, Ed Hornick and Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report.","Joe Biden speaks at his son's deployment ceremony in Delaware .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British election has ended in a hung parliament, as official returns show it is impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats. The leader of the largest party traditionally gets the first chance to form the government and become prime minister. But if no party has a majority, the sitting prime minister -- currently Gordon Brown -- has the right to stay in office and try to win a confidence motion in parliament. Hung parliaments are unusual in Britain. The last time it happened, in 1974, voters were back at the polls within months. CNN's Political Contributor Robin Oakley, a veteran of 12 UK elections, answers questions about a hung parliament. What exactly is a ""hung parliament?"" To enjoy a governing majority in the parliament, a party -- realistically either the Conservatives, led by David Cameron, or the ruling Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown -- needed to win a minimum of 326 seats. That's more than half the total of 650 being contested. A ""hung parliament"" is one in which no single party reaches that minimum number. Without a majority in parliament, a government becomes dependent on MPs -- or lawmakers -- from other parties to get its program voted through the House of Commons, the chamber which passes laws and legislation. Labour ended the parliament dissolved on April 12 with an effective working majority of 56. But the party only had to lose 24 seats to forfeit its majority due to some lawmakers not taking their places in the chamber (such as those from Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein), some lawmakers not having a vote (such as the speaker) and some seats being vacant. So didn't the Conservatives get the most votes? So they did. But the electoral arithmetic makes things more complicated. England, Scotland and Wales do not have proportional representation. Instead the British use the first-past-the-post voting system where winner takes all. The general election is not just a national contest but in effect a mini-election in every one of those 650 parliamentary constituencies. And because of a bias currently built into the British system, the Conservatives in practice need a lead of more than 10 points in their share of the vote to be sure of winning even a single-seat majority. The boundaries of parliamentary seats are periodically revised to keep them close to a notional average size. But the officials charged with the task, and the lengthy appeals process over their decisions, ensure that parliamentary seat sizes don't keep pace with population changes. Currently the distribution favors Labour, which tends to spread its vote more evenly across the country and to win a large number of seats by small majorities, particularly amid the shrinking populations of inner cities. The Conservatives, by contrast, rack up huge majorities of ""surplus"" votes in some safe rural and suburban seats. One way to appreciate the inequity of the system is to note that in the 2005 election it took Labour on average 26,872 votes to win a Parliamentary seat. The Conservatives averaged 44,531 votes per seat and the Liberal Democrats 96,485. Labour's share of the national vote last time was just 36 per cent. But thanks to the way the system worked, that gave them 57 per cent of the seats in parliament. The Conservatives needed to gain an extra 116 seats to have the barest majority of their own -- and they needed around a 10-point margin for that. When did Britain last have a hung parliament. How likely is it this time? The last time a hung parliament happened in Britain was in 1974. But election experts say that the prospects of a repeat have been increasing. Back in the 1960s, the two major parties, Labour and Conservatives used to take around 95 per cent of the vote between them. At the last general election in 2005 they aggregated less than 70 per cent. Not only have the Liberal Democrats advanced (they took 62 seats last time with 23 per cent of the vote) but so have other smaller parties. In Scotland and Wales in 2005 the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalists) won 10 seats between them. And in local government contests and European Parliament elections, fringe parties like the Greens, the British National Party and the United Kingdom Independence Party have shown their ability to collect significant voting support. Winning a national majority is getting harder and the expenses scandals of the last parliament may boost support for minority parties that are apparently less tainted by them. What happened in the last hung parliament? Why are financiers and business people seemingly so jumpy about the possibility of another? Edward Heath, the then Conservative Prime Minister, called an election in February 1974 on the theme of ""Who runs the country?"" after battles with the trades unions. He failed to win a majority but took a bigger share of the national vote than Labour, which had four more seats than his Tories (301 to 297). Heath tried to stay in power, seeking to persuade the Liberals to back him. They would not and so his opponent, Harold Wilson, formed a minority Labour government. Wilson called a second election that year, in October, and that time won an overall majority of three seats. Part of the agitation in some financial circles about the possibility of a hung parliament on May 6 derives from sheer novelty. The first-past-the-post system has so often produced a definite election result that City and currency speculators are suggesting that a minority government -- or a coalition of two or more parties -- would not be strong enough to take tough decisions at a time when the parlous state of the British economy needs decision and consistency at the top. But many European countries where proportional voting systems regularly produce minority or coalition governments seem to manage their economies perfectly adequately. And some calmer Westminster and City voices have pointed out that Britain managed to run its affairs during World War II with a coalition government. So what is likely to happen this time? That is the hardest question. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader whose party could hold the balance of power, says that he won't play kingmaker. That, he says, is a task for voters. He adds: ""Whichever party has the strongest mandate from the British people it seems to me they have the first right to try and govern."" All fine and dandy, except that he didn't say whether that ""mandate"" should be determined by which party had the most seats or which had the biggest share of the national vote -- which wouldn't necessarily be the same thing. Clegg would not be keen to earn the ire of the British people by putting Gordon Brown back in 10 Downing Street, when British voters had refused to renew Labour's majority. But nor would his party stomach him working with the Euroskeptic Conservatives. The money therefore goes on a minority government rather than a coalition.","A ""hung parliament"" is when no party has the minimum number of seats to enjoy a governing majority .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Control tower tapes reveal that the pilot of presidential hopeful Barack Obama's plane told air traffic controllers there was an emergency when he made an unscheduled landing last month in St. Louis, Missouri. Barack Obama's plane had to make an unscheduled landing on July 7 in St. Louis, Missouri. On July 7 the Midwest Airlines MD-81 made an unscheduled landing during the flight from Chicago, Illinois, to Charlotte, North Carolina. The owner of the plane initially said the landing was not caused by an emergency. However the tapes, released to ABC News through a Freedom of Information Act request, contradict that report. ABC first reported on the tapes on Thursday. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown told CNN Thursday evening that preliminary information for incidents is often incomplete or incorrect.  Watch what the tapes revealed » . According to the tapes, the pilot told an FAA air traffic controller that he had limited ability to move the plane's nose up and down. ""We have limited pitch authority at flight levels; we're descending to see if we can regain pitch authority,"" the pilot told the air traffic controller. ""At this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have CFR (fire and rescue equipment) standing by in St. Louis,"" the pilot said. The pilot remained calm throughout the recording. Midwest Airlines acknowledged at the time that the pilot had detected a control problem in the pitch of the plane after an emergency evacuation chute opened in the aircraft's tail cone while in flight. Normally, the chute deploys only after landing and after the tail cone pops off. The pitch, or angle of the nose of an airplane, affects the pilot's ability to control the plane. The airline said the pilot had ""full authority of the aircraft."" According to the tapes, the pilot said he regained control as the plane began to descend into St. Louis. ""We had a pitch authority problem, now that we have come down to a lower altitude it seems to have rectified itself. We do have pitch control of the aircraft at this time,"" he said. Fire trucks met the aircraft when it landed at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. After the plane landed, Obama told reporters the plane landed because of a mechanical problem and noted it marked the first time he had had to do so. ""Just thought we'd spice things up a little bit today,"" he joked. ""Anytime a pilot says that something's not working the way its supposed to, then, you know, you make sure you tighten your seat belt. Everything seemed under control, the pilots knew what they were doing."" The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, said last month that there was no evidence of tampering. An ""examination of the hardware did not reveal any evidence of missing components, nor any evidence of tampering,"" the board said. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","On tape pilot says he has limited ability to move plane's nose up and down .

"(CNN) -- At the 1964 New York World's Fair, people stood in line for hours to look at a strange sight. If only the future looked like ""Star Trek,"" with its nifty gadgets that seem to solve every problem. They wanted to see the ""Futurama,"" a miniaturized replica of a typical 21st century American city that featured moving sidewalks, computer-guided cars zipping along congestion-free highways and resort hotels beneath the sea. Forty years later, we're still waiting for those congestion-free highways -- along with the jet pack, the paperless office and all those ""Star Trek""-like gadgets that were supposed to make 21st-century life so easy. Daniel Wilson has been waiting as well. He's looked at the future we imagined for ourselves in pulp comic books, old science magazines and cheesy sci-fi movies from the 1950s, and came up with one question. Why isn't the future what it used to be? ""I feel entitled to have all this technology that's been promised at a certain time,"" says Wilson, author of ""Where's My Jetpack?"" ""I look up and say, 'Where's all this stuff?' '' Some of that futuristic stuff, it turns out, is already here. Visionaries actually invented objects like flying cars, but they could never work out the real world applications, Wilson says. Other inventions had the same problem. Ordinary people didn't want to have anything to do with them. These futuristic follies include everything from ""Smell-O-Vision,"" an invention that helped moviegoers smell as well as see movies; Sanyo's ""ultrasonic ultra-squeaky clean human washing machine"" (it was dubbed the ""human washing machine,"" but wouldn't fit in an ordinary bathroom) and, of course, the jet pack. ""Scientists are OK at predicting what technology is going to happen in the future,"" Wilson says. ""They're really bad at predicting how it's going to affect us."" What happened to my jet pack? The jet pack is a perfect example of predicting the future, Wilson says. He says the jet pack first appeared in 1928 in an Amazing Stories comic book, which featured the hero Buck Rogers zooming though the sky in a jet pack. The jet pack was actually developed by 1961, Wilson says. An inventor mounted a rocket onto a backpack and called it a rocket belt. A variation of the rocket belt even appeared in the 1965 James Bond movie, ""Thunderball."" Today, the jet pack continues to grab inventors' imaginations. A daredevil wearing a jet pack flew across a 1,500-foot-wide canyon in Colorado in November. A Swiss pilot, dubbed ""Fusion Man,"" flew across the English Channel last year using a single jet-propelled wing. And a New Zealand inventor recently invented a jet pack, which weighs about 250 pounds, that reportedly can run for 30 minutes. The jet pack, though, has never really taken off, Wilson says. The problem is its practical application. While a rocket belt could propel a screaming human to 60 mph in seconds, its fuel lasted for only about half a minute, ""which led to more screaming,"" Wilson says. The military couldn't find a useful application for it either. A soldier with a jet pack might look cool, but he's an easy target. Nor could a jet pack be of use to ordinary people who wanted to avoid rush-hour traffic, Wilson says. Jet-packing hordes could transform the skies into an aerial demolition derby, with air rage and drunk drivers turned into wobbly human torpedoes. Yet other bold visions of the future have come true. Remember Rosey the Robot? That was the name of the robotic maid that waited on the Jetsons, the popular cartoon family from the future. Rosey has become ""Wakamaru."" That's the name of a 3-foot-tall robot with a goofy grin that the Mitsubishi conglomerate in Japan invented to assist elderly people at home by doing everything from reminding them to take their medicine to looking out for burglars. Wakamaru can recognize faces and up to 10,000 words, Wilson says. ""Beam me Up Scotty,"" is a tagline from another television show, ""Star Trek"". But teleportation has been invented, Wilson says. He says a group of international scientists successfully transported a photon -- a bundle of electromagnetic energy -- from one side of a room to another in 1993. Physicists routinely conduct teleportation experiments today, Wilson says. ""Teleporting anything, even elementary particles, is mind-blowing,"" Wilson says. ""Why is it that most people don't know it exists? It hasn't been put into practice yet. In real life, it's always about, 'What can you do for me?' "" A darker view of technology's future . People's fascination with technology's imprint on the future didn't start, however, in the mid-20th century with shows like ""The Jetsons"" or ""Star Trek."" Joseph Corn, co-author of ""Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future,"" found an inflated optimism about technology's impact on the future as far back as the 19th century, when writers like Jules Verne (""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"") were creating wondrous versions of the future. Even then, people had a misplaced faith in the power of inventions to make life easier, Corn says. For example, the typical 19th-century American city was crowded and smelly. The problem was horses. They created traffic jams, filled the streets with their droppings and, when they died, their carcasses. But around the turn of the 20th century, Americans were predicting that another miraculous invention would deliver them from the burden of the horse and hurried urban life -- the automobile, Corn says. ""There were a lot of predictions associated with early automobiles,"" Corn says. ""They would help eliminate congestion in the city and the messy, unsanitary streets of the city."" Corn says Americans' faith in the power of technology to reshape the future is due in part to their history. Americans have never accepted a radical political transformation that would change their future. They prefer technology, not radical politics, to propel social change. ""Technology has been seen by many Americans as a way to get a better tomorrow without having to deal with revolutionary change,"" Corn says. Today, however, a more sober view of technology has sneaked into the nation's popular culture. In dystopian sci-fi films like ""Blade Runner,"" and ""Terminator,"" technology creates more problems than it solves. ""Battlestar Galactica,'' the recent television series, is a prime example. It depicts a world where human beings have created amazing technology that has brought them to the precipice of extinction. There's no Buck Rogers zooming blissfully through the sky. The show follows the journey of a group of humans who created a race of robots called Cylons. The Cylons rebel, virtually wipe out humanity with nuclear weapons, and pursue the survivors through space. Mark Verheiden, a Battlestar writer, says the show's writers pay attention to current events when plotting their story lines. The contemporary world is filled with the unintended consequences of technology, he says. ""There are so many things you can't anticipate when you create a new technology,"" he says. ""Who would have predicted that the Internet would be taking down shopping malls and wiping out newspapers?'' In Battlestar's finale, human beings abandon their faith in technology's ability to improve the future. They destroy their fancy machines and start again as simple hunter-gatherers. ""At some point, you can't expect a miracle to come in the form of technology to save us,"" Verheiden says. ""At some point, the miracle has to come from a change in attitude and a new outlook."" That doesn't mean, however, that Verheiden isn't a fan of imagining future technology. He says he grew up watching ""Star Trek"" and immersing himself in Futurama-like exhibits. The elevated cities and the ""Star Trek"" voyages of yesteryear may now seem corny, but at least they show humanity has a future, he says. "" 'Star Trek' was saying [that] a thousand years from now, people [will] figure out how to get along,"" Verheiden says. ""In some ways, sci-fi says that the future is still optimistic, because no matter how bleak things are, it suggests that we're still here.""","Visionaries have long predicted how inventions will alter the future .

"Rome (CNN) -- Video showing a naked man being sprayed by an aid worker, apparently as part of a medical treatment and in full view of other migrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa, has sparked outrage in Europe. The secretly filed cellphone footage, aired on Italian state television channel RAI, shows a worker at a migrant center spraying the man while others wait for what officials said was a medical treatment designed to prevent a contagious skin condition called scabies. While the camp manager told CNN on Wednesday that the video is misleading, the Speaker for Italy's lower house of Parliament, Laura Boldrini, said in a post on the body's Facebook page that the reported treatment of migrants was ""degrading"" and ""not worthy of a civilized country."" ""Those images cannot leave us indifferent,"" said Boldrini, who was the spokeswoman for several years for the U.N. refugee agency in Rome. She said efforts would be made to find those responsible and hold them accountable. The Italian Interior Ministry ordered an inquiry Tuesday and said it expected a report from the local authorities within 24 hours. EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malstrom condemned the images -- reportedly shot by a migrant at the camp -- as ""appalling and unacceptable."" She said the European Commission would ask the Italian authorities to ""shed full light"" over what had happened. ""We have already started investigations on the deplorable conditions in many Italian detention centers, including Lampedusa, and we will not hesitate to launch an infringement procedure to make sure EU standards and obligations are fully respected,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. ""Our assistance and support to the Italian authorities in managing migratory flows can only be continued if the country guarantees humane and dignified reception conditions to migrants, asylum seekers and refugees."" Camp Manager Cono Gallipo told CNN Wednesday that accusations that camp staff were humiliating migrants were offensive. ""We are aware of what the video shows,"" Gallipo said. ""But that is not exactly how things work and what really happened."" Usually, he said, migrants are given a preventative treatment for scabies inside showers contained in an enclosed cabin where greater privacy can be afforded. They are then given clean clothes to wear, Gallipo said. But he said on the day the video was shot, which he said was December 13, migrants tired of standing in line began removing their clothes before getting inside the cabin. Some asked for the treatment to be done in the open to speed up the process. ""In retrospect we should have stopped the treatment that day,"" he said. ""But at the prospect of either hypothetically breaching the law for omitting to give health assistance to a refugee or hypothetically breaching his/her right to privacy, I opted for the second one."" Shipwreck deaths . Lampedusa made global headlines when more than 300 African migrants died after their ship sank off its shores on October 3. Days later, another 34 people died when their boat capsized. Hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny Mediterranean island's overcrowded detention center. As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries and shipwrecks off its shores are common. Many of the migrants are from African nations, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. The Italian coast guard told CNN in September that there were some 1,250 migrants in residence, in a space designed for 250. In the wake of the October tragedy, the U.N. refugee agency called on Italy urgently to renovate the Lampedusa detention center. The agency's Rome-based representative, Laurens Jolles, said the center's capacity had been reduced from 850 to 250 by a fire in 2011 and had yet to be restored. ""The serious degradation of the reception center, with entire families forced to sleep in the open when it rains, is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said. He described conditions and services there as below European Union standards and urged Italy to speed up the transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to better equipped centers on the mainland. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: Camp manager says video is misleading, rejects claims migrants were degraded .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. military will stop publishing the number of Taliban and insurgents it kills in Afghanistan under orders from the senior U.S. military spokesman for the American-led coalition. A French soldier mans a gun Sunday during maneuvers in Afghanistan's Kapisa province. Rear Adm. Gregory Smith ordered the change as part of the new military strategy in the war that focuses on protecting Afghan citizens rather than killing militants. ""Indicating the number of insurgents killed has little relevance to impacting the lives of Afghans. In fact, if that were the only purpose and metric, you would likely only extend the time it takes to bring about an end to the insurgency,"" Smith said in an e-mail to CNN responding to a query about the change. The issue of publishing enemy body counts has been extremely sensitive to the U.S. military since the Vietnam War when the military regularly published large enemy body counts but seemed to be failing overall to make progress in the war. In the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon has shifted policies several times, both publishing numbers in news releases on particular engagements and firefights and also declaring it would not publish body counts. In the past some military officials have said the numbers have been part of individual releases to the media as a means of demonstrating success against enemy forces. Smith said, ""We conduct operations not aimed at killing insurgents, although in many instances that is the outcome, but to over time clear areas of insurgency and give the people a chance to reconnect with official forms of governance and to rebuild their lives, socially and economically.""","U.S. will stop publishing number of Taliban and insurgents killed in Afghanistan .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of the suspects in a California shooting spree that left two sheriff's deputies dead was deported to Mexico twice, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Authorities say Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was arrested Friday after police found him in a home in Auburn, about 30 miles from the initial shooting. Also arrested was Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento County, who was allegedly with Marquez during the rampage, authorities said. The rampage began in the parking lot of a $56-a-night motel outside downtown Sacramento when two sheriff's deputies checked on a suspicious car there. Authorities said by the time the spree was over on Friday, the suspects had killed two sheriff's deputies in two counties, wounded a third deputy, attempted three car carjackings and shot a driver in the head -- all during a span of six hours. Those events prompted a handful of school lockdowns and a massive manhunt. Reconstructing shooting-carjack spree that left 2 Calif. deputies dead . Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for ICE, says that Marcelo Marquez is actually an alias for a man named Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte. He was removed from the U.S. twice, the first time in 1997 after an arrest and conviction in Arizona for narcotics possession. He was arrested and sent back to Mexico again in 2001. Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was killed in the spree. The 15-year veteran was a husband and father of two daughters. The other slain officer was Placer County Deputy Michael David Davis Jr., 42, an 18-year veteran with a wife and four children. Davis died exactly 26 years after his father, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was killed in the line of duty, authorities said. The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis of Placer County, was shot in the arm. He was later treated and released. The driver who was shot in the head is 38-year-old Anthony Holmes. He is in serious condition in a hospital, according to authorities and CNN affiliates.","One of the suspect in a California shooting spree was previously deported, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged Friday in the beating of two New York Rangers fans outside a landmark restaurant after the Winter Classic hockey game on January 2. Dennis Veteri, of Glassboro, New Jersey, is charged with aggravated and simple assault, conspiracy and recklessly endangering another person, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office. Veteri turned himself in after an arrest warrant was issued and was arraigned shortly after 2 a.m., according to Philadelphia police. The brawl occurred outside Geno's Steaks about an hour after the New York-Rangers Philadelphia Flyers game at the Wells Fargo Center. It was caught on video and posted on YouTube. Police are still looking for additional alleged assailants. The video showed two males in Rangers jerseys being punched and kicked by three males wearing Flyers jerseys. The assault left Neal Auricchio, an off-duty Woodbridge, New Jersey, police officer and Iraq war veteran, unconscious and requiring stitches. ""It is a vicious beating with the conclusion of a knockdown punch which knocks the police officer unconscious to the ground upon which he's further assaulted on the ground,"" said Capt.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal claimed the first trophy of the 2014-15 English season Sunday with an emphatic 3-0 win over Manchester City in the FA Community Shield at Wembley. The traditional match is between the English Premier League champions and the FA Cup winners of the previous season and comes a week before the start of the regular league season. FA Cup winners Arsenal were two-up by halftime as midfielders Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey scored fine goals. The introduction of David Silva to an understrength City team gave them a glimmer of hope after the break, but substitute Oliver Giroud sealed the victory with a curling effort on the hour mark. Victory will be a morale boost for Arsene Wenger's men, who start their EPL campaign at home to Crystal Palace, while City begins its title defense at Newcastle. Wenger was also able to give starts to keynote signing Alexis Sanchez, formerly of Barcelona and other new boys Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy. One man moving in the opposite direction to Sanchez is Belgian defender Thomas Vermaelen, whose move to Barcelona was confirmed Sunday as he was unveiled at the Nou Camp. Vermaelen's old team was winning the Community Shield, formerly the Charity Shield, for the 13th time and the first since 2004. Wenger said that his squad had been improved by recent signings. ""I would say overall it was a united team performance and it was a first half of quality, togetherness and good movement,"" he told gathered reporters. ""It's very difficult to compare (with past squads) but yeah, in the last two I've been speaking about big transfers. In the years before that we always lost big transfers so (the current policy) has now strengthened the squad."" He will be hoping that last season's Community Shield is not a precedent. It turned out to be David Moyes' only honor as Manchester United manager after Robin van Persie scored two goals in the 2-0 defeat of Wigan. United went on to finish seventh in the EPL and Moyes was sacked before the end of the season, to be replaced by Louis van Gaal.","Arsenal wins FA Community Shield at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- An Iowa community was shut down much of Sunday afternoon while emergency crews remained hard at work, sifting through wreckage caused by a wave of powerful tornadoes that swept across the state overnight. The twisters caused major damage to about 60% of Mapleton, a city of about 1,200 residents, Monona County Sheriff Jeff Pratt told reporters Sunday. It was all part of a violent storm system that struck overnight, originating in eastern Nebraska and following a warm front across northern Iowa, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Boksa. But despite causing extensive damage, it did not lead to any fatalities, said Stefanie Bond, a spokeswoman for Iowa's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. Wildfires in Texas | Flooding in upper Midwest . Mapleton was among the hardest-hit areas. Initially, concerns about a gas leak had prompted all nonresidents to be barred from the community, which is about 45 miles southeast of Sioux City. By 5 p.m., people were being allowed back in, though authorities remained on the scene, according to the sheriff's department. The high winds tossed cars and tractors, tore off roofs, caused a car wash to collapse, uprooted trees and downed power lines. Yet Pratt said there had been only minor injuries, giving credit to advance warning as well as an emergency response effort that included authorities both local and from elsewhere. ""There was major devastation to the southwest portion of town, but no fatalities,"" the sheriff said. Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Monona County, according to a statement from his office. The proclamation allows officials to use state funds to help. He later issued a similar proclamation for Pocahontas County, which also suffered severe damage. He then toured the tornado-ravaged town on Sunday afternoon, posting pictures online of uprooted trees and conversations with residents. On his Twitter page, Branstad wrote, ""Please keep the victims in your thoughts and prayers."" The twisters struck just before midnight Saturday. Amateur video recorded by storm chasers shows a large funnel cloud spinning across a flat terrain outside Mapleton. In the background, a passenger can be heard exclaiming, ""It's going to hit that town! ... Mapleton's in big trouble!"" Did you witness the storm? Share your story . Afterward, National Guard troops were brought into the area, according to Stefanie Bond, a public information officer for the state's Homeland Security & Emergency Management Division. She also said that natural gas service was temporarily shut off in the city. The Red Cross was also on the ground providing assistance. Bruce Spence, a government liaison for the group, called the damage to the town ""extensive."" ""The whole town is without power. Main Street is a disaster,"" he told CNN. ""They've shut down the town. As we speak, I'm looking down one of the residential streets. There's debris all over, trees are down. ""This isn't going to get fixed soon,"" Spence said. The National Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa, reported tornado sightings by storm chasers and trained spotters in as many as 11 towns and cities in northern and west-central Iowa over a four-hour period Saturday night. At least three of the twisters, including the Mapleton tornado, caused significant damage, according to Boksa. In Early, a town of 1,600 residents, a tornado ripped roofs off buildings and homes and uprooted large trees, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries in that town. In Schaller, a twister knocked down a dozen trees and felled multiple power poles, the weather service reported. Tammie Pech, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said the agency was opening shelters in Mapleton and Early to take in storm victims. Only four people slept in the Mapleton shelter overnight Sunday, Spence said. Most displaced residents opted to stay with family and friends, he said. The National Weather Service also reported major damage in Nemaha, possibly from a tornado. Bond noted that strong winds also tore through hog pens in Pocohontas Country, in central Iowa, and Kossuth County, in the east along the Illinois border. Three cities in Fayette County -- Fayette, Westgate and Maynard -- were without power for about an hour Sunday evening due to a blown transformer, the state's emergency management spokeswoman said. Randy Frank, Fayette County's homeland security and emergency management coordinator, said that the challenges continued well after the tornadoes came through, with sustained winds blowing at least 50 mph into Sunday evening. ""Our biggest problem right now is fuel fires out of control,"" said Frank, whose county is about 255 miles from Monona County. ""And it's that way across the state, with the wind, which (can) be very dangerous in (fanning) the fire.""

"London (CNN) -- Europe's leaders are battling to keep the eurozone and the wider European Union together in the face of a financial crisis that threatens to split partnerships forged over more than half a century. So why are they putting so much effort into preserving unity? And can they prevent today's debts and differences from dividing the continent for decades to come? Why is unity so important to Europe? The answer lies in Europe's history: The continent has historically been split by long-running conflicts that pitted neighboring countries against each other. But despite this, the nations of Europe also share much in common, as Professor John Loughlin, of the University of Cambridge's department of politics and international studies explained. ""In the 19th century there was an idea that Europe had a natural unity, that its constituent parts shared an identity, a culture, a history,"" he told CNN. ""People were keen to recover this 'lost unity' which dated back to before the fragmented days of the individual nation states, to previous unions, and even to the Roman Empire."" Where did the idea of a European Union come from? The idea of a united Europe goes back centuries, and has been proposed by everyone from William Penn -- the founder of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania -- to philosophers Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham. French novelist and activist Victor Hugo backed the idea of a ""United States of Europe"" in the 19th century, looking forward to the day when the U.S. of A. and the U.S. of E. would ""stretch out their hands across the sea... and join together to reap the well-being of all."" Hugo, author of ""Les Miserables"" and the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" predicted that: ""A day will come when there will be no battlefields but markets opening to commerce and minds opening to ideas. A day will come when the bullets and bombs are replaced by votes."" However, it was not until after World War II that a European union became a realistic prospect. Why then? By 1945, much of Europe had been devastated by two massive wars in quick succession. Amid the rubble and ruins, politicians and the public -- exhausted by years of violence -- shared the belief that such conflict should never be allowed to happen again. Rather than focus on trying to find a shared ideology -- the reason behind much of the earlier conflict -- politicians saw economic unity as a way of preventing future clashes. French politician Robert Schuman, regarded as one of the founding fathers of the EU, came up with the idea of pooling coal and steel production in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), so that the ""raw ingredients"" for war -- munitions -- were placed out of reach. He hoped the ECSC, created in 1951, would mean that, ""any war between France and Germany [became] not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible."" What is it? The ECSC, which was made up of six nations (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) later evolved into the European Economic Community (EEC) -- under which the member states established a common market, and worked to harmonize their policies on everything from agriculture and fisheries to monetary policy. Over the following decades, the EEC became the European Union, and expanded from the original six nations to today's 27 members, from Finland in the north to Malta in the south. That enlargement has also seen many members of the former Soviet Union join up -- highlighting another of the EU's key roles. ""During the Cold War, Western Europe united to form a bloc against the Soviet Union, because there was a genuine fear that the Communists would sweep across Europe in their tanks,"" Loughlin said. ""After the fall of the Berlin Wall, that part of the world was extremely unstable. It had had a kind of peace, but one built on oppression, and once that collapsed there were real fears of conflict. ""The EU was very important in ensuring peace and stability in the region -- it helped countries' transition to democracy, and build economic prosperity."" Has it worked? Loughlin says the union has succeeded in its most basic aim. ""It is still a very important aspect of European unity that there has been no major war since World War II. ""There have been smaller conflicts, in Northern Ireland and in the Basque country, and of course there was the situation in the Balkans, but in that case, the prospect of joining the EU has been a very powerful factor in preventing further wars."" It hasn't all been plain sailing though -- national differences persist, and many issues have caused divisions and debates between the member states, from the introduction of a single currency to the war in Iraq. ""Not all the tensions have gone away,"" said Loughlin. ""Not all the conflicts have been resolved. ""The old reflexes, the old fears persist. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, for example, [President Francois] Mitterand [of France] and [Prime Minister Margaret] Thatcher [of Britain] were very nervous about the prospect of a united Germany."" However, the euro crisis has provided the union with its biggest challenge yet -- and it is one that is playing on national prejudices and resentments. ""The Greeks are very upset that their whole character seems to be being called into question, that they are being portrayed as profligate, irresponsible. ""The old stereotypes are still there, and they tend to resurface at times of tension. The danger is that they can really affect the outcome of these situations, and there is just too much at stake here."" How determined are Europe's current leaders to support unity at any cost? In 2011, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy insisted that Europe would never give up on the euro. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he said: ""We will never abandon the euro. Never! Euro spells Europe, the euro is Europe. Europe has meant 60 years of peace on our continent. We will never abandon that. ""To imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each others' throats for centuries, we now have one wish, and that is lasting peace."" However, by the end of last year, both France and Germany -- the two driving forces behind the euro -- had admitted that in order to ensure the currency's survival, Greece may have to withdraw. Can European unity survive the current crisis? ""The EU was formed for three reasons: To prevent war, to bring political unity, and for economic integration. If the euro collapses -- and I suspect it won't -- all three of these dimensions would be at risk,"" said Loughlin. ""At this stage I think the process is probably irreversible -- there is too much at stake to allow the whole thing to unravel -- if it did it would be worse than the U.S. subprime crisis. So many countries are locked in to the system; even those who aren't EU members, like Norway, have so much bound up in it. ""I suspect the EU will muddle through in the end -- but then who knows? There have been so many surprises recently, and you never really know what is around the corner.""","The European Union was designed to reduce risk of war in Europe .

"(CNN) -- The woman who accused three Duke University lacrosse players of rape five years ago was arrested Sunday, suspected of stabbing her boyfriend, police said. Officers responding to a call early Sunday about a stabbing at an apartment in Durham, North Carolina, found a 46-year-old man who had been stabbed in the torso, police said. He was taken to Duke University Hospital for treatment of serious injuries. Officers later arrested the man's girlfriend, Crystal Mangum, 32, at a nearby apartment. She was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury, police said. Mangum was placed in the Durham County Jail without bond. Officers said the stabbing occurred during an argument at the couple's shared apartment. In March 2006, Mangum claimed to have been sexually assaulted by three players on the Duke lacrosse team while performing as a stripper for a team party. North Carolina's attorney general later found no credible evidence that the attacks ever occurred and the charges were dropped. The scandal, however, forced the cancellation of the men's lacrosse season that year and the resignation of team coach Mike Pressler. It also led to widespread criticism of Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, who was later disbarred for his handling of the case. Mangum was arrested in February 2010 on attempted murder charges after a fight with her then-boyfriend. She was also accused of arson, identity theft and resisting arrest, among other charges. CNN affiliate WTVD-TV reported the arrest happened after she set fire to a pile of the boyfriend's clothes while her children were at home. In a June 2010 interview with the station, Mangum said her boyfriend had attacked her, and that her involvement in the Duke lacrosse case had influenced police handling of the case. ""I do feel that I am being unjustly treated because of preconceived notions about my character in the media,"" Mangum said at the time. In December, a jury found Mangum guilty of child abuse in the case but could not agree on a first-degree felony arson charge, which could have resulted in a seven-year sentence, WTVD reported.","Police charge Crystal Mangum with assault with a deadly weapon .

"(CNN) -- Most of us have become so used to suppressing noise that we don't think much about what we're hearing, or about how we listen. Yet our well-being is now being seriously damaged by modern sound. Here are 10 things about sound and health that you may not know: . 1.) You are a chord. This is obvious from physics, though it's admittedly somewhat metaphorical to call the combined rhythms and vibrations within a human being a chord, which we usually understand to be an aesthetically pleasant audible collection of tones. But ""the fundamental characteristic of nature is periodic functioning in frequency, or musical pitch,"" according to C.T. Eagle. Matter is vibrating energy; therefore, we are a collection of vibrations of many kinds, which can be considered a chord. 2.) One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony. The World Health Organization defines health as ""a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"" which opens at least three dimensions to the concept. On a philosophical level, Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras and Confucius all wrote at length about the relationship between harmony, music and health (both social and physical). Here's Socrates: ""Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful."" Watch an interview with Julian Treasure . 3.) We see one octave; we hear ten. An octave is a doubling in frequency. The visual spectrum in frequency terms is 400-790 THz, so it's just under one octave. Humans with great hearing can hear from 20 Hz to 20 KHz, which is ten octaves. 4.) We adopt listening positions. Listening positions are a useful set of perspectives that can help people to be more conscious and effective in communication -- because expert listening can be just as powerful as speaking. For example, men typically adopt a reductive listening position, listening for something, often a point or solution. Women, by contrast, typically adopt an expansive listening position, enjoying the journey, going with the flow. When unconscious, this mismatch causes a lot of arguments. Other listening positions include judgmental (or critical), active (or reflective), passive (or meditative) and so on. Some are well known and widely used; for example, active listening is trained into many therapists, counselors and educators. 5.) Noise harms and even kills. There is now wealth of evidence about the harmful effect of noise, and yet most people still consider noise a local matter, not the major global issue it has become. According to a 1999 U.S. Census report, Americans named noise as the number one problem in neighborhoods. Of the households surveyed, 11.3 percent stated that street or traffic noise was bothersome, and 4.4 percent said it was so bad that they wanted to move. More Americans are bothered by noise than by crime, odors and other problems listed under ""other bothersome conditions."" TED.com: Music is medicine, music is sanity . The European Union says: ""Around 20% of the Union's population or close on 80 million people suffer from noise levels that scientists and health experts consider to be unacceptable, where most people become annoyed, where sleep is disturbed and where adverse health effects are to be feared. An additional 170 million citizens are living in so-called 'grey areas' where the noise levels are such to cause serious annoyance during the daytime."" The World Health Organization says: ""Traffic noise alone is harming the health of almost every third person in the WHO European Region. One in five Europeans is regularly exposed to sound levels at night that could significantly damage health."" The WHO is also the source for the startling statistic about noise killing 200,000 people a year. Its findings (LARES report) estimate that 3 percent of deaths from ischemic heart disease result from long-term exposure to noise. With 7 million deaths a year globally, that means 210,000 people are dying of noise every year. TED.com: Jose Abreu on kids transformed by music . The cost of noise to society is astronomical. The EU again: ""Present economic estimates of the annual damage in the EU due to environmental noise range from EUR 13 billion to 38 billion. Elements that contribute are a reduction of housing prices, medical costs, reduced possibilities of land use and cost of lost labour days."" (Future Noise Policy European Commission Green Paper 1996). Then there is the effect of noise on social behavior. The U.S. report ""Noise and its effects"" (Administrative Conference of the United States, Alice Suter, 1991) says: ""Even moderate noise levels can increase anxiety, decrease the incidence of helping behavior, and increase the risk of hostile behavior in experimental subjects. These effects may, to some extent, help explain the ""dehumanization"" of today's urban environment."" Perhaps Confucius and Socrates have a point. 6.) Schizophonia is unhealthy. ""Schizophonia"" describes a state where what you hear and what you see are unrelated. The word was coined by the great Canadian audiologist Murray Schafer and was intended to communicate unhealthiness. Schafer explains: ""I coined the term schizophonia intending it to be a nervous word. Related to schizophrenia, I wanted it to convey the same sense of aberration and drama."" My assertion that continual schizophonia is unhealthy is a hypothesis that science could and should test, both at personal and also a social level. You have only to consider the bizarre jollity of train carriages now -- full of lively conversation but none of it with anyone else in the carriage -- to entertain the possibility that this is somehow unnatural. Old-style silence at least had the virtue of being an honest lack of connection with those around us. Now we ignore our neighbors, merrily discussing intimate details of our lives as if the people around us simply don't exist. Surely this is not a positive social phenomenon. 7. Compressed music makes you tired. However clever the technology and the psychoacoustic algorithms applied, there are many issues with data compression of music, as discussed in this excellent article by Robert Harley back in 1991. My assertion that listening to highly compressed music makes people tired and irritable is based on personal and anecdotal experience - again it's one that I hope will be tested by researchers. 8. Headphone abuse is creating deaf kids. Over 19 percent of American 12 to 19 years old exhibited some hearing loss in 2005-2006, an increase of almost 5 percent since 1988-94 (according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Josef Shargorodsky et al, reported with comments from the researchers here). One university study found that 61 percent of freshmen showed hearing loss (Leeds 2001). Many audiologists use the rule of thumb that your headphones are too loud if you can't hear someone talking loudly to you. For example, Robert Fifer, an associate professor of audiology and speech pathology at the University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, says: ""If you can still hear what people are saying around you, you are at a safe level. If the volume is turned so loudly that you can no longer hear conversation around you, or if someone has to shout at you at a distance of about 2 or 3 feet to get your attention, then you are up in the hazardous noise range."" TED.com: Evelyn Glennie shows how to listen . 9. Natural sound and silence are good for you. These assertions seem to be uncontroversial. Perhaps they resonate with everyone's experience or instinct. 10. Sound can heal. Both music therapy and sound therapy can be categorized as ""sound healing."" Music therapy (the use of music to improve health) is a well-established form of treatment in the context of mainstream medicine for many conditions, including dementia and autism. Less mainstream, though intellectually no more difficult to accept, is sound therapy: the use of tones or sounds to improve health through entrainment (affecting one oscillator with a stronger one). This is long-established: shamanic and community chant and the use of various resonators like bells and gongs, date back thousands of years and are still in use in many cultures around the world. Just because something is pre-Enlightenment and not done in hospitals doesn't mean that it's new-age BS. Doubtless there are charlatans offering snake oil (as in many fields), but I suspect there is also much to learn, and just as herbal medicine gave rise to many of the drugs we use today, I suspect there are rich resources and fascinating insights to be gleaned when science starts to unpack the traditions of sound healing. I hope these thoughts make a contribution to raising awareness of sound and its effects on health. I welcome your reaction, and I will check this forum and respond. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Treasure.","Julian Treasure: Sounds we hear have an important effect on our lives and health .

"(CNN) -- During the past few months, I have gently suggested to my patients that they receive the flu vaccine. Many said yes, but some declined. Today, as I look up Google's national flu trend map, I see nearly the entire country painted in an alarming red, signifying ""intense"" flu activity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 41 states are experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. There are 26 times more flu cases this year than last. And in Boston, near my primary care practice, a public health emergency was declared this past Wednesday. I shake my head when seeing these headlines, and I vow to be more persuasive when it comes to giving the flu vaccine. More patients need to be protected against influenza by getting flu shots earlier in the season. Like many other clinics across the country, my office is flooded with patients suffering from coughs, runny noses, fevers and body aches, all potentially caused by the flu. Thankfully, the vast majority of adults survive. But others fare less successfully: the young, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes or cancer. Severe flu complications, like pneumonia, can hospitalize these patients, or worse, be fatal. Consider the young. According to William Rodriguez, a pediatrician at the Food and Drug Administration, between 43 and 153 children have died in the past 10 flu seasons combined. Already, 18 children have died this season. One reason why the flu outbreak is so prevalent this year is that the predominant strain, H3N2, hasn't been this widely circulated since 2002-03 and is associated with a more severe illness. But another reason is the relatively low percentage of patients who received a flu shot. This year's vaccine is well matched to the circulating viruses and, while not perfect, provides good protection. Flu shots are about 60% effective. But more than half of Americans skip the vaccine. Only 46% received one last year. This year's numbers are about the same. The reason many cite, ""I got the flu from the flu shot!"" isn't valid. There are no live viruses in the vaccine. If someone got sick after the shot, it's because of a coincidental illness caused by the scores of other non-influenza viruses that can cause similar upper respiratory symptoms. Others say, ""I've never had the shot before, and I've been fine."" In some, the flu can be debilitating, leaving patients bedridden for days. In others, it can simply be a runny nose or a minor cough. But it's still the flu and can be spread to more vulnerable patients, with disastrous consequences for them. According to Frank Esper, a viral respiratory disease expert at UH Case Medical Center in Ohio, ""Every time you vaccinate yourself, you're not just protecting yourself, but you're protecting everyone you know, including individuals who are young or pregnant."" It's still not too late for a flu shot. Go get one if you haven't already. Although its protective action won't take effect for about two weeks, the flu season hasn't peaked. I realize I have to do a better job to dispel these myths in the exam room and convince more of my patients to receive a flu shot. But patients can also help. Read the headlines and learn from the current flu crisis. Then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Dozens of recording stars converged on a Hollywood studio on Monday evening to add their voices to a song they hope will raise millions of dollars for Haitian earthquake relief. The lyrics and music are an updated version of ""We Are the World,"" a song that raised at least $30 millions for African humanitarian programs 25 years ago. Music legends -- including crooner Tony Bennett and Barbra Streisand -- stood with newcomers -- including 15-year-old Justin Bieber and country artist Zac Brown -- in the crowded studio Monday night. Lionel Richie and the original producer, Quincy Jones, gathered ""a diverse group of contemporary superstar artists"" at the same studio used for the 1985 recording session,"" organizers said in a news release. Richie co-wrote the first song with Michael Jackson. The production team includes producer-musician Wyclef Jean, producer RedOne and producer-musical director Ricky Minor, the statement said. The world premiere of the new ""We Are the World"" will take place during the NBC network's coverage of the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Vancouver, Canada, on February 12, it said. Paparazzi and security surrounded Henson Studios, just off Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard, as limousines delivered the stars Monday for what was expected to be a marathon overnight recording session. Smokey Robinson, who sang on the original, said the roster of 100 singers asked to take part does not include any of the 45 stars from the previous version. Legendary crooner Tony Bennett and Beach Boy original Brian Wilson were among those seen entering the studio Monday evening. Many of the stars were already in Los Angeles to attend Sunday's Grammy Awards show. The original 1985 roster of artists was packed with such superstars that Jones placed a sign above the studio door that read: ""Check your egos at the door."" The roster of artists made public by organizers includes: Carlos Santana, Orianthi, Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Sugarland, Adam Levine, Jason Mraz, Earth Wind & Fire, Natalie Cole, The Jonas Brothers, T-Pain, Brian Wilson, Justin Bieber, Nicole Scherzinger, India.Arie, Julianne Hough, Mary Mary, Melanie Fiona, BeBe Winans, Mya, Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Hamilton, Raphael Saadiq, Gladys Knight, Keri Hilson, Joel and Benji Madden, Heart, Brandy, Pink, Musiq Soulchild, Miley Cyrus, Akon, Jordin Sparks, Celine Dion, Rob Thomas, Katharine McPhee, Jeff Bridges, Randy Jackson, Patti Austin, Kid CuDi, Usher, Will.i.am, Kanye West, LL Cool J, Issac Slade (of The Fray), Snoop Dogg, Nicole Richie, Trey Songz, Ethan Bortnick, Taryll Jackson, Taj Jackson, TJ Jackson, Vince Vaughn, Drake, Freda Payne, Faith Evans, Robin Thicke, Rashida Jones, Barbra Streisand, Jimmy Jean Louis, Enrique Iglesias, Zac Brown, Lil Wayne, Tony Bennett, Josh Groban, Sean Garrett, Harry Connick Jr., Al Jardine, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Bizzy Bone) and A.R.Rahman .

"(CNN) -- A few weeks ago, an Arabic campaign exploded on Twitter. The Arabic hashtag -- #الراتب_مايكفي_الحاجة (loosely translated as ""the salary does not meet my needs"") -- reached 17 million tweets in the first two weeks. At its height, it registered 1.2 million tweets a day, and was not only the most popular hashtag in Arabic, but the 16th most popular in any language. Somewhat unexpectedly, the campaign, which hints at a financially aggrieved populace, comes out of one of the world's wealthiest nations: Saudi Arabia. ""There's a feeling among some people that I guess you could characterize as anger. Others are disappointed, some think it's a question of (the Saudi government's) priorities,"" says Fahad Nazer, a Saudi political analyst with JTG Inc. The anger he refers to is fueled by growing unemployment and frustration at government spending. Nazer notes that the campaign gained particular traction following the Saudi government's announcement that it would give financial aid to Egypt's military regime. ""The government is giving handouts to Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, and using a third of the country's budget for this year to pay for the Riyadh metro. Meanwhile, Saudi's are paying most of their salary on rent, private schools, private hospitals -- because public ones aren't good -- while salaries have practically stayed the same,"" laments Manal Al Sharif, a Saudi activist who gained notoriety for posting video of herself driving on YouTube. She is also one of the country's most vocal tweeters. ""There's a long list of things that are wrong,"" she adds. Unemployment is higher than one might suspect in the oil-rich nation. Though official figures are hard to come by, there are approximately 1.8 million Saudis enrolled with Hafiz -- the country's unemployment benefits program -- according to Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher with Human Rights Watch. The campaign has also drawn attention to a topic that was once considered taboo: Saudi poverty. Accompanying many of the tweets are images and video supposedly depicting Saudis living in squalor; some show Saudi's beggar class while others reveal the existence of Saudi shanties. Lynsey Addario, a photographer who documented Saudi poverty in Riyadh for Time Magazine, recalls how the assignment challenged her expectations. ""What you see on the surface are the shiny buildings and the shopping malls and the new universities being built -- the wealthy side. I was actually quite shocked when we went to the slums,"" she says. She recounted families struggling to pay the bills, and living in single-story, cockroach infested houses in the heart of Saudi Arabia's capital. ""Poverty in Saudi challenges many people's assumptions, including some Saudis',"" admits Nazer. Poverty and unemployment are particularly rife among Saudi youths (Coogle estimates they make up anywhere between 18 and 35% of the unemployment rate), and even more so among women. According to English-language newspaper the Saudi Gazette, an annual report put out earlier this year by the Ministry of Labor showed Saudi men in the private sector earn an average of $1,516, with women staffers pulling in half that sum. Al Sharif notes that working women are at a further disadvantage due to the many practices that are banned to them. ""A woman in Saudi is dependent on men to do just about everything in her life. If a man doesn't exist, she will have to pay for those services she can't do herself, like driving a car, starting her own business or going to court,"" she notes. Read more: Saudi Arabia's first anti-abuse campaign . Despite its popularity, the campaign has attracted critics who argue Saudis are already too reliant on their government. Nazer himself notes that the campaign risks oversimplifying what is actually a very complex issue. Several factors, he argues, have fed unemployment, including a population explosion -- since the '70s, Saudi has grown from 6 million people to nearly 20 million, with an additional 10 million expats competing with nationals for jobs. Adding to the problem is the fact that in the past, many Saudis chose to study religion and languages -- areas for which there is little demand. ""It's a complex situation, as is true of any economy. People who try to trivialize or simplify it miss a lot of variables,"" says Nazer. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, what's been particularly surprising is the willingness of Saudis -- who traditionally value cultural privacy -- to air their grievances in an international forum. ""It's true, we are a very private nation, and we don't want the rest of the world to know anything about us,"" admits Al Sharif. However, she says, it's a price many Saudis are willing to pay. ""Saudis are realizing that you can't isolate yourself from the rest of the world, because the only way we can communicate and read each other's views is through social media. It's our kind of parliament, where we can go and debate, and do things we can't do in the real world.""","Saudi Arabian Twitter users have flocked to a campaign bemoaning wages in their country.
The hashtag became the 16th most popular in any language.

"(CNN) -- California's Oakland port terminal re-opened on Tuesday after Occupy protestors shut the facility down overnight, but the disruption ""cost the Port and City of Oakland vital resources,"" a statement from officials said. ""They hurt the many businesses that pay taxes and help us create jobs,"" Robert Bernardo, communications manager for the port, said. Bernardo said port officials were committed to ""regaining the confidence of partners who bring business to Oakland and the region."" On Monday, a statement from the port authority said there were ""some delays of truck traffic"" but said the port remained operational. But by Monday night, the protests had disrupted workers ability to get to work and impaired the port's ability to operate, officials said. Officials said the disruptions resulted in a backlog of of work to get through, cost workers shifts and wages, and caused a negative ripple effect for people up and down the West Coast. Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin suggested the Occupy movement should focus on ""real solutions to the problems plaguing our economy."" On a normal night, several hundred people would be working the graveyard shift, port spokesman Isaac Kos-Read told CNN. ""What has this accomplished?"" he asked. ""This is disrupting the 99%."" The Occupy movement has rallied against what it describes as corporate greed while asserting that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan concurred with Kos-Read, saying the Occupy movement isn't thinking of the consequences of its actions and whom it is actually hurting. ""They are saying ... they have to get the attention of the ruling class. I think the ruling class is probably laughing and people in this city will be crying this Christmas,"" Quan said. ""It's really got to stop."" Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement. The union ""shares the Occupy movement's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses,"" ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview, Washington, and warned against ""outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda."" In Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, three people claiming ties with the Occupy movement blocked the main door of House Speaker John Boehner office. The men, who said they were in the 120th hour of a hunger strike, sat together with stickers that read ""Taxation without representation"" taped over their mouths. They said they were demanding full voting rights for residents in the District of Columbia. Elsewhere, police moved into the Occupy Baltimore encampment at around 3 a.m. Tuesday to remove protesters that had been in McKeldin Square for the last two months, according to CNN affiliate WMAR. Local reports said officers were out in full riot gear, and police cars surrounded the area, but there were no major incidents reported. Reports showed the city of Baltimore recently denied a permit extension for the camp and cut off its power supply, and that several incidents -- including a stabbing -- had occurred at the encampment recently. In a statement released Tuesday morning, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said people are free to assemble and demonstrate, but ""our public parks and green-spaces should not be treated as permanent campgrounds."" Rawlings-Blake said her administration will provide ""outreach and assistance"" to the homeless. Tuesday's actions followed Occupy protests -- and police reactions -- in several cities on Monday. In Houston, police arrested 20 protesters after dozens of police on foot and on horseback confronted a somewhat larger group of Occupy protesters who blocked an interstate on-ramp, authorities said. In Long Beach, California, protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations, according to Police Chief Jim McDonnrell, who added that two arrests were made. About 80 protesters demonstrated outside the gate of San Diego's port Monday but caused no disruption, port spokesman Ron Powell said. Four people who sat down in the road were arrested, he said. The demonstrations that began Monday in port cities were part of a nationwide Occupy effort in the aftermath of efforts by cities across the country -- including New York, Boston and Oakland -- to clear demonstrators from encampments they had set up in public parks and other locations. ""We are occupying the ports as part of a day of action, boycott and march for full legalization and good jobs for all to draw attention to and protest the criminal system of concentrated wealth that depends on local and global exploitation of working people, and the denial of workers' rights to organize for decent pay, working conditions and benefits, in disregard for the environment and the health and safety of surrounding communities,"" Occupy organizers said on their website.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- For nearly 30 years, one man dominated Egypt. Hosni Mubarak, 82, survived would-be assassins and ill health, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement, and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed. His government's continued observance of the Camp David accords was the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. But following the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman, demonstrators in the streets of Cairo stood up to riot police, chanting, ""Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you."" Ultimately, the demonstrations helped bring down the man critics called Egypt's last pharaoh. Mubarak decided Friday to step down, Vice President Omar Suleiman said on state television. Now that Mubarak is finally exiting the political stage, the debate over his legacy is growing louder. Longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak purchased for nearly three decades came at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world's most populous nation. ""Egypt is a broken country,"" Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN. ""It used to be the jewel of the Middle East. It's the capital of its cultural production."" But now, Gerges said, ""Egyptians have no outlets. They don't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future."" Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt's air force during the 1973 Mideast war. The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero, and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975. Six years later, Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade, killed by Islamic militants from within the army's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel. Upon assuming office, one of Mubarak's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely. He made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades. The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986, and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists. ""He pretty much wiped them out,"" University of Michigan Professor of History Juan Cole said. ""It's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt."" The government penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that ""if five people (sat) down to plot something, the fifth person (wrote) a report to Hosni Mubarak about it,"" he said. The result was ""a regime that has very little legitimacy, but presents itself as something there's no point in trying to change,"" said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power, changed the thinking of many in the region. ""I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,"" he said. Mubarak headed off a similar movement in 2005, when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform. He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests, Brown said. But the most recent protest movement had ""no real leadership, so it (couldn't) be decapitated the same way,"" Brown noted. Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities. His fifth, in 2005, was Egypt's first multi-party presidential vote, but it was widely criticized as a ""sham,"" Cole said. Meanwhile, the country's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of Mubarak's rule. Development picked up in the last decade, fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars, but gains were ""very unevenly distributed,"" Gerges said. About 40% of Egyptians currently live in poverty, he noted. The aging autocrat escaped at least two assassination attempts, including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia. In recent years, Mubarak had several bouts of illness but never picked a vice president. He was widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor, but later insisted he never intended for his son to take power. In 2003, Mubarak collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu. He had back surgery in Germany in 2004, returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. He largely withdrew from public view in recent years. His domestic political situation was closely watched overseas, particularly in the United States. In the past decade, Egypt has been a major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. It receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year -- second only to Israel -- and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and while sticking with Camp David, Egypt's ties with Israel amount to a ""cold peace,"" Cole said. President Barack Obama said recently that Mubarak was ""very helpful on a range of tough issues,"" but prodded the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform. ""You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets,"" Obama said. He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the recent demonstrations, adding, ""I think it's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances."" Gerges said the Middle East has seen ""the barrier of fear"" removed since the events in Tunisia. ""Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus"" in Egypt and elsewhere, he said. ""We're going to have a new era of politics.""","Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years, surviving would-be assassins, ill health .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Filmmaker Roman Polanski, arrested in Switzerland over the weekend, will fight extradition to the United States where he faces sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old girl, his California lawyers said Monday. Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris, France, in June 2009. ""An issue related to the Swiss extradition matter is presently being litigated before the California Court of Appeal,"" attorneys Douglas Dalton and Chad Hummel said in a prepared statement. Separate legal counsel will represent Polanksi in any legal proceedings in Switzerland, they added. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Los Angeles, California, released a detailed timeline of the Polanski case, which dates to 1977. It indicated that prosecutors had tried to have Polanski arrested and extradited from Israel in 2007. It also shows that prosecutors obtained a ""provisional arrest warrant"" upon learning on September 22 that Polanski planned to travel to Switzerland to participate in a film festival. The warrant was obtained through the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, and Swiss authorities executed it on Saturday.  Watch Polanski's victim speak out » . The DA's timeline revealed that multiple attempts have been made over the years to take Polanski into custody for extradition. Those attempts involved Polanski's planned travels to England, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Brazil and Israel. Earlier on Monday, French authorities expressed solidarity with Roman Polanski's family and outrage over the arrest. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he hoped authorities would respect Polanski's rights ""and that the affair (will) come to a favorable resolution,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The French culture and communications minister, Frederic Mitterrand, said he ""learned with astonishment"" of Polanski's arrest. He expressed solidarity with Polanski's family and said ""he wants to remind everyone that Roman Polanski benefits from great general esteem"" and has ""exceptional artistic creation and human qualities."" Investigators in the United States say Polanski drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl in the 1970s. Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, but he fled the United States before he could be sentenced. He settled in France. U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978. Police in Switzerland arrested Polanski on that warrant Saturday after the 76-year-old tried to enter Switzerland to attend the Zurich Film Festival, which is holding a tribute to Polanski this year. Filmmakers have reacted with outrage at the arrest. ""As a Swiss filmmaker, I feel deeply ashamed,"" Christian Frei said. ""He's a brilliant guy, and he made a little mistake 32 years ago. What a shame for Switzerland,"" said photographer Otto Weisser, a friend of Polanski. The Polish Filmmakers Association posted a letter on its Web site Monday from the European Film Academy secretariat that protested ""the arbitrary treatment of one of the world's most outstanding film directors."" The letter, which was read aloud at the festival, was signed by directors Wim Wenders, Volker Schloendorff and Bertrand Tavernier; actress Victoria Abril; cinematographer Peter Suschitzky; and screenwriter and actor Jean-Claude Carriere. Mitterrand said he has spoken with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and that Sarkozy ""shares his hope for a rapid resolution to the situation which would allow Roman Polanski to rejoin his family as quickly as possible."" Mitterrand said he ""greatly regrets that Mr. Polanski has had yet another difficulty added to an already turbulent existence."" Polanski won an Academy Award for best director in 2003 for ""The Pianist."" He was nominated for best director Oscars for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown"" and for best writing for ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which he also directed. A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport. A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles, California, after authorities learned he was going to be in Switzerland, Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, told CNN on Sunday. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child."" The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put ""in provisional detention."" But whether he can be extradited to the United States ""can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalized,"" ministry spokesman Guido Balmer said in an e-mail.  Watch what happens now for Polanski » . Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland, but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski's sentencing process, depending on what happens in Zurich. Polanski was accused of plying the then-teenage girl, Samantha Geimer, with champagne and a sliver of a Quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. He was 43 at the time. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was there. She said Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. ""I don't think he's a bad man,"" she said in a probation report. ""I think he's an unhappy man."" Polanski's lawyers tried this year to have the charges thrown out, but a judge in Los Angeles rejected the request. However, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. According to court documents, Polanski, his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the teen avoid a public trial. But the original judge in the case, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanski fled the United States for France, where he was born. In the February 2009 hearing, Espinoza mentioned a documentary film, ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,"" that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" Espinoza said. But he declined to dismiss the case entirely. Geimer is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. She filed court papers in January saying, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim."" Geimer, now 45, married and a mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. CNN's Morgan Neill, Frederik Pleitgen, Brooke Bowman, Karan Olson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Polanski was arrested en route to Zurich Film Festival, which was honoring him .

"(CNN) -- Connectivity was the name of the game at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, held last week in Las Vegas -- especially when it came to health-related products. From cloud-connected scales to music-connected sex toys, these gadgets rose above the rest as those that might really help you keep your New Year's resolutions. Sleep soundly . A small, lightweight band users wear on their heads during sleep, the Zeo Sleep System measures brain waves while you're in dreamland, and will sync via Bluetooth with your smart device. Zeo's free app plots out how many hours of quality snooze time you're getting each night. Great feedback for our highly caffeinated, tech-obsessed society, it also plots out sleep quality based on behaviors you input. How much did those three glasses of vino affect your sleep? How about that late night fast-food run, or actual run? Zeo gives you concrete tips for improving your sleep routine based on your habits, and will even wake you up at the optimum time in your sleep cycle. The Zeo is available for a one-time purchase price of $99. (No monthly subscription required.) Body bands . A bevy of body bands made a splash at CES this year, among them the BodyMedia Fit and the Basis Band. BodyMedia's Fit monitoring system consists of a small electric band the user wears on his or her arm, that works in conjunction with a software interface that's available on your smartphone or online. Users input their daily calorie intake, and the device monitors calories burned. The band uses sweat sensors, an accelerometer and skin temperature monitors to figure out how much exercise you're doing, and for how long. It compares that to your food intake to give a picture of your daily health. The accelerometer knows when you're lying on your back for hours at a time (presumably sleeping), and adds that to your fitness picture as well. The Fit CORE is available for $149, but requires plugging in to synch your data. The new Fit LINK is Bluetooth-enabled for wireless synching, and is available for $179. Both products require a $6.95 monthly subscription to BodyMedia's online dashboard. Similar to the BodyMedia's Fit, the Basis Band adds real-time heart rate monitoring to the mix by using a optical engine that ""looks through the skin to see actual blood flow,"" similar to the technology used in pulse oximeters (those little things they put on your finger at the doctor's office.) The Basis Band is also worn on the wrist rather than on the arm, and looks more like a trendy watch than a fitness monitor. The Basis is available for pre-order, shipping sometime this quarter; and will be $199. The price includes lifetime access to the cloud service and online interface -- no monthly subscription required. Smart medical devices . Smart medical devices abounded on the expo floor this year. The Withings Wi-fi Body Scale, a sleek device that looks like an iPhone you can step on, connects with your iPhone, or other iOS or Android-capable phone. The scale measures your weight, lean and fat mass and calculates your BMI almost instantaneously. To keep things simple (and less depressing), the display only shows your weight -- the rest of the information floats up to the cloud, and is available on your smartphone. The free app interface also lets you invite friends, family members or your doctor to view your progress; and it will keep track of data for up to eight users. The Withings Wi-fi Scale is available for $159, which includes lifetime access to the web and phone service. Unfortunately, just because this scale is cloud-connected, doesn't mean you're going to be any lighter. Withings also had another smart medical device: the iPhone Blood Pressure Cuff. Wrap it around your arm and then plug this bad boy into your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. A small compressor in the device inflates the cuff, using power from your device. Once the reading is complete, the information is logged in a free app, and is available to send to your doctor for analysis and tracking. The cuff is available for $129 with no recurring monthly fees. California-based iHealth Labs also brought a Wi-Fi scale and blood pressure cuff to the table; but a third product really caught our attention: the Smart GlucoMeter. As more of the connected generation starts dealing with diabetes, this high-tech tool may encourage diabetics to check their blood sugar more often. The device is simple: Plug a pack-of-gum-sized accessory into the bottom of your Apple device, insert a test strip, prick your finger (unfortunately, they haven't been able to eliminate that step). Put a drop of blood on the strip. Within a few seconds, the device measures your blood sugar, and catalogs it for you and your doctor to track. The GlucoMeter is pending approval with the FDA, and should be available in the latter half of 2012. The price has not yet been set. Health apps . Just as cool as some of the hardware at CES was the software. ""Gamification"" of health was a popular phrase on the show floor, and several companies weighed in with entries to that category. Among the coolest were ... UnitedHealth Group's OptumizeMe is a social fitness app that lets you challenge friends and family to get healthy. The app allows users to make their own health challenges or select from a list of popular challenges. Among them: competitions to see who can walk the most steps in a day, who can be the first to run 100 miles, and who can eat their daily servings of fruits and veggies. The app allows you to add a prize for the top dog and share your results on social networking sites with friends. OptumizeMe is a free app, and it allows you to sync fitness information with your employer's benefits plan if your company has United Healthcare coverage. (TimeWarner, CNN's parent company, is a member of United Healthcare insurance coverage.) This app isn't a new entry into the category, but a much improved one. Lose It! is a weight-loss management tool that allows users to keep track of food and exercise on the go. The app has a catalog of thousands of the most popular foods, and all of the nutrition information for each of them. Popular new additions to the app include bar-code scanning of your favorite prepackaged food items, the ability to create and share custom foods and recipes with your friends, and a FourSquare-like badge-earning system, that rewards users' daily entries, weight loss milestones, and sharing activities.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of attacks in Iraq killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens Wednesday, police said. A car bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in Hafriya about 35 km southeast of Baghdad on Wednesday afternoon, according to police and health officials. At last three people were killed and 15 others were wounded, officials said. Hafriya is a predominately Shiite district located in Wasit province. A car bomb targeting a security convoy exploded near two hotels in central Baghdad, killing a person near the scene of the blast and wounding seven others. In Kirkuk, at least nine people were killed -- including five Iraqi soldiers -- and 31 people were wounded when three car bombs exploded in and around the ethnically mixed, oil-rich city north of Baghdad. In the southern Iraqi city Hilla, a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market, killing five people and wounding 12 others. Hilla, which is predominately Shiite, is in Babel Province. In Diyala Province, two roadside bombs and a car bomb, all in different areas, wounded 11 people. One targeted the convoy of Diyala Gov. Omer Aziz al-Hamri, but he wasn't hurt in the incident. Last month, nearly 150 people were killed and 300 others were wounded in violence across the country, according to the interior ministry. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the recent attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda. Violence has dropped dramatically in Iraq since the peak of Sunni-Shiite clashes in 2006 and 2007 and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country in December 2011, but insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist. Many areas are still smoldering with sectarian tension and political infighting. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki Tuesday night to reaffirm U.S. support of the Iraqi government, al-Maliki's office said.

"(CNN) -- It's laughable to watch political prognosticators on the various TV shows weigh in on Rahm Emanuel's chances of becoming the next mayor of Chicago, Illinois. If you trust any of them, you swear President Barack Obama's outgoing chief of staff sees the position as a birthright that he is about to assume now that Richard M. Daley is stepping down. Folks, don't buy the national media hype. As they say, all politics is local, and in this case, Emanuel has a long way to go before he can even think of moving into the fifth floor mayoral suite. Chicago has long been called a city of neighborhoods, and as a resident of the city for the last six years, I have witnessed the territorial views of its residents live and with full effect. River North. Bronzeville. South Loop. Hyde Park. Beverly. Bridgeport. You name it, Chicago is a city that is all about its neighborhood boundaries, and when you ask someone where they were born and raised, they are likely to give you the street address rather than just the South Side, North Side or West Side. And those boundaries are often defined by race. With that being said, the issue of race will be a major obstacle for Emanuel, and not because he's white and Jewish. First, it's assumed that because he was a Chicago congressman for six years, he's well known in the city. Not true. Yes, he did represent a Northwest Chicago district, but there are political strongholds all across the city, and he's going to have to navigate them. The Chicago Sun-Times commissioned a poll shortly after Daley announced he wasn't seeking re-election, Emanuel placed fifth with 7 percent, within the margin of error. Those topping the poll: Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart (12 percent); state Sen. James Meeks (10 percent); Rep. Luis Gutierrez and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. at 9 and 8 percent, respectively. Chicago has never had a Hispanic mayor, and African-Americans are still champing at the bit to revive the legacy of former Rep. Harold Washington, who stunned the nation with his election in 1983 when he bested a younger Richard M. Daley and Mayor Jane Byrne in the Democratic primary. No one thought he had a chance because race has loomed large in heavily Democratic Chicago, and that was on full display when Washington eked out a victory that November against Bernard Epton, a white Republican who no one gave a shot and who some say subtly stoked the fears of white residents about a black takeover. His death in 1987 still resonates in the city, and with Daley reigning supreme for two decades, running everything from the schools to public housing to the rail system and the city college system, that enormous constituency sees this moment as an opportunity to finish what Washington started. African-Americans dominate five of the city's top 10 wards. And of the top 23 wards with registered voters, African-Americans control a majority in 12. Don't assume that Emanuel, being a Democrat, can easily win those. And if you're one of those folks who think it's wrong for me to focus on race, then you clearly don't get Chicago politics. It is an open secret in Washington that the Congressional Black Caucus despises Emanuel. A longtime caucus member told me that normally when they meet with the president, the chief of staff attends the meetings. But in the time Obama has been in the White House, Emanuel didn't attend one meeting, and has always given a cold shoulder to black members of Congress. And if you ask black political operatives, pollsters and insiders, they all have a ""why-I-can't-stand-Emanuel"" story. If he wants to win the mayor's race, just having the public support of Obama isn't enough. He is going to have to deal with Reps. Danny Davis, Bobby Rush and Jesse Jackson Jr. All three have massive ground troops, and if they are willing to rally around someone like the Rev. James Meeks, also a state senator (I attend his church, Salem Baptist Church of Chicago), who can also pull white social conservatives to his side, Emanuel can forget about getting a significant share of the black vote. Then there is Chicago's Hispanic community. The population is substantial, but to count, they need to be registered voters, and Hispanic voters do not dominate a large portion of the 50 wards. Yet winning their votes is vital to building a winning constituency. And with many blaming Emanuel for no progress on immigration reform over the last 18 months, and with Emanuel facing brutal scrutiny from Gutierrez, a major immigration reform proponent, he's going to have to do a lot of politicking in order to win. Of course, there are the city's white voters. You have the Lakefront liberals and the city's blue-collar workers, who are strong union supporters. Emanuel has been at odds with unions in his time as chief of staff, notably over health care and the primary bid of Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, and the national labor leaders will be quick to remind their supporters in Chicago just how good a friend Emanuel was or wasn't. Emanuel will also have to stare down Dart, a white man who won office with a multiracial coalition and has gained high marks, especially for refusing to follow through on serving residents with eviction notices from their foreclosed homes. If he is in the race, along with Alderman Robert Fioretti, a savvy politician from the West Side of Chicago, they will be able to win a sizeable portion of the white vote, thereby leaving Emanuel on the outside looking in. Emanuel rightfully gets praise for his tough-as-nails approach to politics. But in a city that is used to Daley running the show with an iron fist for so many years, frankly, this might be the wrong time for someone with Emanuel's style to seek the city's top post. We can expect a bruising battle in February for the job, and as many as 15 candidates could be on the ballot. The top two vote getters will go to a runoff, and there is a strong chance that Emanuel may not be one of those two. His run is certainly a gamble, and suffice it to say this could be the riskiest political decision he has ever had to make. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Rahm Emanuel is leaving White House with ambition of becoming Chicago's mayor .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Keith Fitzhugh could have spent this weekend at New Meadowlands Stadium, being regaled by some 83,000 fans as a member of the New York Jets. Instead, he chose to keep his day job, working on the railroad. No spotlights, no television cameras, no adoring throngs. The only waves that he could get -- seconds of attention, in between long stretches of quiet -- will be from kids standing alongside the tracks, asking the unnamed engineer to pull the horn. And he's not complaining. ""That was always my childhood dream,"" said Fitzhugh of playing pro football. ""Driving transit was always my second childhood dream."" For months, the Hampton, Georgia, resident -- like millions of Americans -- was living more of a nightmare, unemployed and struggling to get by. A star safety at Mississippi State, he had three stints over the past two seasons in the National Football League with the Baltimore Ravens and twice the Jets. But each time, Fitzhugh had been released. For someone who, for years, had lived and breathed football, rejection was not easy. What was even harder, he said, was living without the paycheck and without any clear prospect that NFL stardom and dollars were in his future. What he was certain about, though, was family. The 5-foot-10, 210-pound Fitzhugh was in the prime of his life healthwise, but not bringing home any income. His father disabled and unable to work, his mother was the only family member with a regular paycheck. Fitzhugh said he was used to getting such support, emotionally as much as economically. His parents had cheered him while he played football, encouraged him to think of life after football, took care of him. When his sister died after contracting West Nile virus while he was in college at Starkville, his mother held off on telling him until he played a key spring football game. She, his father, his grandmother and other family members were always like that: thinking and taking care of everyone else, all while keeping their heads up, said Fitzhugh. His sister's loss especially, he said, made him realize that while football was a game, family was everything. ""They were there for me, when I went through some of the lowest times of my life,"" Fitzhugh said. ""And I needed to be there for them, also."" So he was thrilled when he recently got a full-time job with Norfolk Southern, a position that allowed him to run trains around the country and also bring home regular income and benefits to help support his family. But his suddenly stable life got turned upside down Tuesday, when his agent called to tell him about the Jets offer. Fitzhugh was off and at home, his father resting in bed. His agent told him the 9-3 team wanted him, right away. Could he make a 2 o'clock flight? Not, said Fitzhugh, without checking with his new employer first. ""My heart started racing, I started sweating immediately,"" he recalled. ""This is not happening to me. I'd just got this new job, and I don't want to let them down (so they think) every time I get a phone call, I'm going to run away."" He'd learned that professional football jobs were fleeting. He knew his railroad job was not as glamorous, it might not pay as much, but it was stable and allowed him to help his family long-term. So, before he'd even found out from Norfolk Southern if he could take a leave of absence (he later learned that he could have), Fitzhugh made up his mind. ""I just felt that the best decision at that time, for me, was to keep my job,"" Fitzhugh said. ""Because the economy is so bad right now, jobs are very scarce. Once you have a good job like this, I (thought) that I should just keep it."" Money, fame, and the thrill of competition on the gridiron are great. And Fitzhugh says that he hasn't closed the door on pro football totally, not if the time is right. But he said that he's comfortable with his decision to stay off the sidelines and stay on the tracks. Doing so will be different than battling the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, but Fitzhugh believes he will still get a rush and he'll still have the support of family and ""fans."" ""You have families that go outside in their yards or go by the tracks, and just wave at the conductors and engineers as they are riding by -- that feeling is really good,"" said Fitzhugh. ""Like the experience in the NFL, you still have fans out there.""","Keith Fitzhugh is a new employee with Norfolk Southern railroad .

"(CNN) -- For the first time, Indonesian maids working in Saudi Arabia will be guaranteed a monthly wage, time off, and contact with their loved ones, under a new agreement signed by the Gulf kingdom and Jakarta this week. Human rights groups say the pact is a step towards ensuring the protection of foreign workers' basic rights in Saudi Arabia. But it fails to address a worrying trend of domestic helpers filing complaints of exploitation and abuse only to face counter-allegations by their employers of ""theft, witchcraft or adultery,"" according to Human Rights Watch. The penalties for these crimes are harsh in the deeply conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which practices a puritanical form of Islam. ""There's a real belief, and it's something that can be prosecuted through the Saudi courts, that black magic or witchcraft is real,"" said Nisha Varia, senior researcher for women's rights at Human Rights Watch. ""Domestic workers are especially vulnerable to these types of accusations because of cultural differences."" Abuse of Asian migrants . Varia, who spoke to domestic workers as part of a report on abuses against Asian migrants in Saudi Arabia, says an amulet on a necklace may be enough for an employer to accuse a maid of plotting to bring bad luck on the family. Earlier this month, King Abdullah pardoned an Indonesian maid, who was on death row after being convicted in 2003 of ""casting a magic spell on her employer and his family,"" a spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy told Saudi news site, Arab news. She returned to her home in West Java, but others haven't been so lucky. Some 41 other Indonesian workers face possible death sentences in Saudi Arabia on charges ranging from black magic to stealing, adultery and murder, according to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry and local non-profit groups. Many facing charges claim they suffered long-term abuse or exploitation at the hands of employers, according to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's director for legal aid and protection of Indonesian nationals overseas, Tatang Budie Utama Razak. ""When I observe why they killed their employer, most of them were not mentally ready (to work overseas),"" Razak told CNN. ""They have to work unlimited hours, they have take care of the children, take care of the house, (their salaries are) unpaid, they cannot go out, (and) they cannot contact their families,"" he said. No fair trial . Most have not been given a fair trial, said Anis Hidayah, executive director of Indonesian group Migrant Care. ""Sometimes they don't have access to interpreters or lawyers who make sure they understand the trial process,"" Hidayah added. Hidayah's organization is campaigning for the release of Satinah binti Jumadi Ahmad, a 40-year-old maid who is on death row for murdering her employer and fleeing with SR37,500 (US$10,000). The woman reportedly admitted to killing her boss but said it was in self defense as her employer had been trying to attack her at the time. In cases like Satinah's, it can be difficult to know exactly what happened, said Varia from Human Rights Watch, since the alleged incidents often take place behind closed doors in employers' homes. Varia said many domestic workers who are being overworked or aren't getting paid won't come forward because they fear the authorities will believe their employers, who are well-connected or at least speak flawless Arabic, over a foreigner who may be unfamiliar with the language, local laws and her rights. 'Blood money' Satinah is due to be beheaded in the coming weeks, unless she can raise a hefty ""blood money"" payment to give to her employer's heirs. Indonesian authorities have negotiated the amount down from SR10 million (US$2.6 million) to SR7 million (US$1.8 million), according to Razak. The maid's 20-year-old daughter, who was 11 when her mother left Indonesia, sent a letter to the employer's family pleading for her release. So far, SR4 million has been raised, including a SR3 million contribution from the Indonesian government along with other donations from Indonesian citizens and an unnamed Saudi donor, Razak said. Around 1.5 million women -- mostly from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines -- work in Saudi Arabia as domestic workers, according to Human Rights Watch. They make up less than a quarter of the kingdom's eight million foreign workers but account for most of the complaints received by embassies of sending countries, the organization said. Common complaints include wages not being paid, passports being seized, brutal work hours, and forced labor along with physical and sexual abuse. Another 28-year-old Indonesian on death row, Tuti Tursilawati binti Warjuki, allegedly killed her employer in 2010 when he attempted to rape her following months of sexual violence. Workers freeze . In 2011, the beheading of Indonesian maid Ruyati binti Satubi by Saudi Arabia sparked outrage in Indonesia. Jakarta had been in the process of requesting a pardon for the 54-year old, and was not informed prior to her execution. This seemed to be the last straw for Indonesia which announced it would put a freeze on sending new workers to Gulf nation. Saudi Arabia responded by suspending visas to Indonesian domestic workers. The ban has remained in place since, but disputes between foreign workers from other countries and their employers have continued to emerge. In one of the most high-profile cases, a Sri Lankan, Rizana Nafeek, 24, was beheaded in January 2013 after being convicted of killing her employer's baby when she was 17. At the time, Amnesty International condemned the death and warned that ""a disproportionate number of foreign nationals, mainly migrant workers from countries in the global South,"" had been executed in Saudi Arabia over recent years. New rules . Six months later, Saudi Arabia introduced new regulations that offered all foreign domestic workers basic protections including sick leave, work days of no longer than 15 hours, and paid vacation for one month every two years. The regulations also stipulated that domestic workers must respect the teachings of Islam, maintain her employer's family secrets, and follow their employers' ""orders."" After more than two years of negotiation, Saudia Arabia and Indonesia signed an agreement on Wednesday that clarifies, for the first time, the duties and wages of workers and responsibilities of employers, explained Razak. According to reports in Saudi media, a statement from Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Labor said the pact aims to ""strengthen relations between the two countries and moderate the relationship between employers and employees."" The ministry has signed similar agreements with three other countries that, combined, make up 70% of Saudi Arabia's domestic helper workforce, and has started new committees to look into foreign workers' issues, the statement added. CNN reached out to Saudi authorities for this story but have yet to receive a response. Under the new agreement, Indonesian maids must have one day off a week, be allowed to keep their passports, to communicate with family and friends outside their employers' homes, and receive health insurance. The agreement could lead to the ban being lifted, but Indonesia wants to see how it will be implemented before allowing more citizens to migrate to Saudi Arabia, according to Razak. He hopes the agreement will minimize the risk of Indonesians ending up on death row in Saudi prisons by preparing the workers better while helping employers to understand the rights of workers in their homes. Rights groups skeptical . Indonesia must also ensure potential domestic workers receive medical check ups and do not have a criminal record, and setting up these systems will take time, Razak said. There must also be a shift in how some employers perceive their workers, he said. ""We thank the destination countries because they have provided jobs. At the same time the user must be thankful for the workers, because they also will be assisted by the workers."" But human rights groups are skeptical that the 2013 regulations and the new pact with Indonesia will improve the lives of the workers any time soon. Varia from Human Rights Watch said there are some advances in the pact, but it fails to tackle some of the root causes of what makes domestic workers so vulnerable, such as Saudi Arabia's ""kafala,"" or sponsorship, system. ""Employers have so much control over their domestic worker by being their immigration sponsor. They have control over whether the domestic worker can change jobs (and) they have to give their approval before the domestic worker even leaves the country,"" she said. ""This system is the cause of such a huge power imbalance that leads to a lot of exploitation and that needs to change.""","Saudi Arabia and Indonesia sign pact to outline basic rights of foreign domestic workers .

"(CNN) -- A U.N. panel on Friday said with 95% certainty that the effects of climate change are real and largely man-made. To which pretty much everyone in Shishmaref, Alaska, said ... Well, duh. If only they weren't so polite. The tiny Inupiat Eskimo community in near-Arctic Alaska -- which I was lucky enough to visit on a reporting trip in 2009 and which is home to some of the sweetest and most colorful people you'll meet -- has been watching climate change happen to it for years now. Locals see the sea ice forming later each year, the coast eroding and the permafrost melting. The hunting seasons have shifted and lakes have dried up. The coast had become so unstable that one house toppled off the edge of the barrier island that harbors the village. When I was there, the town was considering relocating to more stable ground. Now those plans seem to have dried up, too. Stanley Tocktoo, the mayor of Shishmaref, told me by phone Thursday that residents have tabled their plans to move the town. Money is one reason. Another is that they were unable to find a suitable location upon which everyone could agree. Potential relocation spots also are hit by the changing climate, he said. ""The island is only a quarter-mile wide by three miles (long), probably narrower now. I don't know how long we'll be able to be on this island,"" he said. ""These floods get pretty fierce now, worse than before."" It should seem laughable in 2013 that anyone would try to deny the reality of climate change, which is causing tougher droughts, stronger storms, rising seas and melting ice. The effects are scattered, to be sure. It's difficult to attribute any single storm to macro-changes in the atmosphere, for example. But it's clear things are changing. It's clear that's for the worse. And it's clear -- has been clear -- that we're to blame for that. I'm thankful the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change continues to update all of us on the latest science and evidence. But it's already obvious to everyone paying attention that we need to act in new and profoundly urgent ways to blunt the future impact of climate change, and to mitigate the changes that are already taking shape all over the world. The Marshall Islands and other Pacific nations that could be swallowed up by rising seas have banded together to try to make their economies 50% or 100% renewable. The urgency is clear to them. They fear for survival. But in the United States, we're still running around with our eyes shut. Sure, President Barack Obama has tried, between arguing for strikes on Syria and trying to resurrect the middle class, to make climate change a front-burner issue. But Congress hasn't followed suit. America remains a serious laggard on climate action. Perhaps we should open our eyes, and turn them to Alaska. There, the evidence is like a slap in the face. A wake-up call. ""The town is coming apart, getting smaller and smaller."" That's Shelton Kokeok, a 68-year-old who lives, with his wife, Clara, at the very edge of the Shishmaref coast, which has been thawing and falling into the sea. A multimillion-dollar U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project has bought Kokeok some peace of mind. The engineers piled rocks high on the shore, as if imploring the land to stay. But even the engineers know that the measures are temporary. The Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska had $45 million to deal with coastal erosion issues that are related to climate change, according to Bruce Sexauer, chief of planning for the Alaska District. That money ran out though. The rock wall in Shishmaref was planned to be nearly twice as long as it is, but money is now only available if the village can put up 35% of the cash needed to build it. I'm pretty sure a place where people hunt seals for food and harvest ice for water doesn't have millions to spare. It's a beautiful, generous village. But not a rich one. The wall, as it stands, likely will buy Shishmaref several years. But much already has been lost. When I visited him four years ago, Kokeok told me he blames the death of his youngest son, Norman, on the changes to the climate. Norman fell through a thin sheet of ice on the first week of June several years ago. That area should have been frozen solid, Kokeok said. He told me, back in 2009, that he hasn't been the same since. I was pleased to hear on Thursday that, after two knee replacements, Kokeok was able to go caribou hunting with his grandchildren and daughter this summer. That's something he hadn't done in years. The land here, and the community, means so much to him. Another community, Newtok, which was the subject of a fascinating series by The Guardian, is actually in the process of relocating now, according to Sexauer. Dave Williams, a colleague of Sexauer's, told me that the permafrost is thawing out from beneath the town, making it nearly unlivable. ""Some of the boardwalks are underwater during the summertime,"" he said. ""You can't step off the boardwalk and walk anywhere without getting wet up to your crotch and covered in muck. You can see that when it floods now, houses that were above the flood level now get water in them or are surrounded by water and (you) can't go anywhere. ... It happens slowly, over years and years."" Slowly, over years and years. But still, impossible not to notice. I could think of a few senators I'd like to send up to that village to wade in the muck. Maybe it would alleviate their nagging sense of industry-funded doubt. Or, at the very least, they'd have to make excuses in a ruined pair of pants. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","U.N. panel releases the first part of its new climate assessment this week .

"(CNN) -- For me, Chinese New Year used to be fun. When I was a kid, I was excited during Chinese New Year when I got lai see and I could stay up late. I even had access to candy, a once-a-year treat while living under the roof of my Tiger Mom. Riding strong on the sugar highs, I always thought to myself, this is what it must feel like to be an adult. I was flush, free and giddy. Then at some point in my twenties, Chinese New Year became a chore. Not any garden variety chore, but a cold-sweat-inducing family obligation that I try hard to avoid. As an adult, Chinese New Year is an annual nightmare, for the following reasons: . 1. I find it sucks when you are single . Relatives feel that they have a right to judge you because you do share bits of DNA, so, really, it's almost like they're judging themselves. Typically, the extended family gathers for Chinese New Year and spends an inordinate amount of time together, during which people get bored and focus their restlessness on judging the younger generation, particularly those who are single. Singledom means a lack of responsibilities and responsibility-free people need to be reined in by the wisdom of elders, or they will be reckless with their directionless lives. Here are some unavoidable conversations at Chinese New Year. By ""conversations"" I really mean monologues by one Wise Elder or another, fired away at a particular Single Younger in a trance-like manner: . ""Why don't you have a boyfriend? If you have a boyfriend, why don't you get married?"" ""Why are you not dieting at least a little bit? Second Cousin Yong Yong will have to start bringing clothes from America for you."" ""What happened to your hair? Blue is not such a good color for us Chinese people."" ""Are you saving up for an apartment? Why not? The most important thing in life is to have a roof over your head. You don't want to be homeless, do you? What if the economy collapses again? At least you will have an apartment."" ""Why don't you get a better paid job? You are wasting your talent. You will regret your life."" 2. I am employed . I loved the great Chinese tradition of gifting lai see. Getting HK$20 for no reason other than tradition really rocked my seven-year-old world. I have an income now, so twenty bucks here and there doesn't make a huge difference, but I still retain that childhood anticipation for the red packets. It's just a bit disappointing when I open up an envelope and it isn't concealing a massive check. And it's the guilt from feeling disappointed that makes me really hate Chinese New Year for making me hate myself. It's just like being unable to conceal your letdown expression when unwrapping that pair of socks at Secret Santa parties. Gifting is a heartwarming tradition. It's the thought that counts. I am not supposed to care. I am a bad person. There's even worse. Chinese New Year gambling is just out of hand. Now that I have a job, I'm expected to bet real money at The Mahjong Table, a no man's land filled with hidden agendas, treacherous scheming and Janus-faced traitors. If you beat your elder relatives at mahjong one too many times, beware their wrath. It really hurts when you get hit by a mahjong tile. If you lose on purpose to your elders and are unable to skillfully conceal your purposefulness, you risk looking patronizing. It will put them in a bad mood and lead to a vengeful ""what are you doing with your life"" interrogation later. See point number one. If you're simply crap at the game, you lose a load of money and will probably be judged for being not very intelligent. See point number one again. 3. I like good food . When foreigners make jokes about Chinese eating weird foods, I cringe. When Chinese New Year comes around, I'm the one making the damn jokes. At this time of year, we do get some incredible festive dishes. And then there are those odd ones that make you feel like the taste, texture and nutritional content of food have all become irrelevant -- we only eat for superstitions. Lots of Chinese New Year foods are auspicious in meaning, but atrocious in taste. I propose that we at least get rid of these three that are now out of touch with our lives: . Chinese New Year cake . Called ""leen go"" in Cantonese (""niangao"" in mainland China), the name sounds auspicious and means ""to progress more and reach higher every year."" The cake is made from glutionous rice, sugar and flavored with red bean paste or jujubes. Cut into thin slices, dip into beaten eggs and pan fry until it's gooey on the inside and crisp on the outside. The problem is, no one makes these at home anymore and the store-bought version is bland and stodgy, like eating slices of caulking. Since glutinous rice is considered difficult to digest for the elderly, us Single Youngers who have nothing to lose are forced to finish the plateful. Sugared lotus seeds . Back in the day -- before globalization brought us jelly beans and Sugus, before the invention of Coca-Cola, before Christopher Columbus brought cocoa beans to the Old World -- eating sugar-coated lotus seeds during Chinese New Year seemed like a good idea. Today, we have so many more delicious ways to feed our sweet tooth, so why do people still buy sugared lotus seeds? They look like mothballs, taste one dimensional and feel like a marble of sand broken upon the tongue. The name ""leen tsi"" sounds like ""to birth sons each year."" No one in the family likes to eat them and most of them already have kids, which means us Single Youngers have to swallow. Gok tsai . These are deep-fried sweet dumplings. The skin is a thick, lifeless pastry made from lard, the filling is a mind-numbingly sweet blend of sugar and nuts. Its shape and color makes it, somewhat, resemble a gold ingot. Eating these symbolize prosperity for the new year. If I had to run a marathon, I might appreciate the fat bomb. But the only thing that I run are scripts on my browser.

"(CNN)Terrorism is nothing new to Europe. But there are new, pressing questions tied to the latest threats -- ones that authorities are trying to answer in their quest to get the upper hand and keep the continent safe. European security services in recent weeks have received indications that the extremist group ISIS may have started directing European adherents in Syria and Iraq to launch attacks back in their home countries, a senior European counterterrorism official told CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Separately, a Western intelligence source told CNN national correspondent Deborah Feyerick that the threat appears to involve as many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The source said that European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies identified an ""imminent threat"" to Belgium, and possibly also to the Netherlands. Last week's attacks in France are proof that these threats could become reality at any time. Assessing how close Europe is to another such attack, and doing whatever possible to prevent it are top priorities now for European authorities. What is the nature of the threat? Beyond what has emerged about Thursday's raids in Belgium -- which ended with two suspects dead -- details remain sketchy. The European counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that there were indications that returnees from Iraq and Syria had been directed by ISIS leadership to launch attacks on European soil in revenge for airstrikes in Syria and Iraq. ""That would be a game changer because ISIS up to this point has not orchestrated any terrorist plots in the West,"" Cruickshank said. ""There have been some ISIS fighters who have come back, but they have launched plots on their own steam."" The official named France, the United Kingdom and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat and said counterterrorism agencies in Germany are also on high alert. Several European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. A senior Belgian counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that the suspected terrorist cell that was raided is believed to have received instructions from ISIS. German authorities, meanwhile, said they had arrested three men on suspicion of links to ISIS. A 26-year-old man suspected of having trained to fight in Syria and trying to recruit others to join ISIS was detained in Lower Saxony on Thursday; and two men in their early 40s suspected of supporting ISIS in Syria were taken into custody in Berlin on Friday. But none of the men appear to have been planning attacks in Germany, authorities said. Are there concerns about any other groups? Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the deadly shooting at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris last week. U.S. authorities said they thought the video was authentic. But they weren't ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. ""We're not there yet. There are good indicators"" that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing, a senior administration official told CNN. At least a dozen people were detained in the Paris region overnight in connection with last week's shootings, the city prosecutor's office said Friday. The European counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that there was also significant concern about Khorasan, an al Qaeda affiliate group, plotting attacks against Europe. Last week, Andrew Parker, the head of the British security service MI5 warned that a group of core al Qaeda terrorists in Syria was planning mass casualty attacks against the West, an apparent reference to the Khorasan group, according to Cruickshank. Are ISIS and al Qaeda working together in Europe? That doesn't seem to be the case, despite the apparently mixed affiliations of the Paris attackers. Cherif and Said Kouachi, the two brothers who French authorities say carried out the Charlie Hebdo attack, are believed to have had links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. But Amedy Coulibaly, who attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris and demanded that police end their siege of the Kouachi brothers, pledged allegiance to ISIS. In Syria, ISIS and al Qaeda have become fierce rivals since they severed ties early last year. ""I think the leadership of the two groups is not working together. And indeed, in many cases in Syria, they have fought each other,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, a senior member on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. ""But outside of the theater of war, it certainly appears that those collisions and conflicts are less important to some of the people who are radicalized."" ""In France, as in probably the United States, Europe and elsewhere, you have people that have a closer affinity to one or the other,"" he told CNN. ""Some have been just radicalized online, and maybe the message of ISIL and the caliphate resonates more,"" Schiff said, using another acronym for ISIS. ""Others may have actually received training or support from AQAP, as may have been the case with the Kouachi brothers. And plainly, they don't have a problem working together overseas to attack Western targets."" The European counterterrorism official told Cruickshank that the possible shift by ISIS to direct attacks in Europe was partly the result of increased competition between ISIS and al Qaeda affiliates, including Khorasan, to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad. Are the Belgian raids connected to the Paris attacks? CNN affiliate VTM reported that the terrorism investigation in Belgium started weeks ago, and there has been no connection established with the Paris attacks. The three people targeted in the raid in the city of Verviers, in which two of them were killed, had been under surveillance for some time, said Belgian prosecutors' spokesman Thierry Werts. A Western intelligence source told CNN that the Paris attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the Belgian operation. That included the arrest of a Belgian arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to Coulibaly. Belgian investigators questioned the arms dealer and searched his possessions, the source said. Through him, the investigators got a number of ""positive hits"" on suspected extremists already known to authorities. After the Paris attacks, the source said, investigators stepped up the urgency. How big is the challenge facing security agencies? European officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by fighters returning from Syria. More than 3,000 Europeans have left to fight in Syria in recent years. The total number who have returned to Europe is now estimated to be over 500, according to Cruickshank, including 250 who have returned to the United Kingdom, almost 200 to France and around 70 to Belgium. An indication of the potential threat came last year in the deadly shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium. The suspect in that case is Mehdi Nemmouche, a French citizen who has also been accused of helping to guard ISIS' Western hostages in Syria. Nemmouche was arrested in France and extradited to Belgium to face trial over the museum shooting. He has denied the charges. But the sheer number of Europeans returning from Syria, as well as those suspected of other jihadist activities, makes the task of identifying who is a threat very difficult for law enforcement agencies. ""If there are literally hundreds of people going back to Western Europe, the ability of the police to literally sit on everybody becomes problematic from the standpoint of having the manpower,"" said Michael Chertoff, who was secretary of homeland security under President George W. Bush. CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","European authorities are busy after last week's terror attacks in France .

"By . David Mccormack . and Sam Webb for MailOnline . Robin Williams once chartered a private plane to pay a surprise visit to meet a terminally ill girl after she became too sick to visit him on set. Following the actor’s sad death on Monday, a number of people have come forward with inspiring stories about how he touched their lives and the latest is Mark Cole from Greensboro, North Carolina. He recalls Williams’ kindness and warmth when he paid a special visit to meet his daughter Jessica, age 5, as she lay dying with brain cancer in 2004. Scroll down for video . The father of Jessica Cole, who died of brain cancer in 2004, has recalled how Robin Williams chartered a private plane to visit his dying daughter in North Carolina and spend several hours cheering her up . The meeting was arranged through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Jessica’s final wish was to meet her ‘hero’. ‘Robin Williams was her hero,’ Mark Cole told WFMY. ‘She was a huge fan and especially Ms. Doubtfire.’ Originally Jessica was supposed to travel to California to meet the actor on set, but her condition deteriorated and she was no longer fit to travel. 'In 2004, it became apparent that there was nothing doctors could do to reverse the process with the tumor growing,' said her father. The meeting in 2004 was arranged through the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Jessica's final wish had been to meet her 'hero' When the kind-hearted actor was informed about Jessica's condition he chartered a private plane to visit her at home the very next day. 'She was a little disoriented at that point with extra fluid on her brain, it was out of place for her also seeing Robin Williams walk into our home. She was confused when he first came in. Then he started his Mrs. Doubtfire imitation and then she figured it out pretty quickly.' The pair spent the day playing cards and watching football. ‘He acted like he had known her forever,’ said Mark Cole. ‘He was a lot of fun to be with.’ Jessica passed away on December 14, 2004. Loss: . Teenager Jessica Cole, who spent a day with Robin Williams two months . before she passed away. He chartered a private jet to go and see the . girl when she became too ill to travel . One of Williams' most notable film roles was Patch Adams, where he played a medical student who helped his patients by making them laugh with his zany antics. However, the actor, like the character he portrayed, also had a heart-warming dedication to helping patients after the cameras stopped rolling. Family members of those he comforted have paid tribute to the 63-year-old, who was found dead in his San Francisco mansion on Monday. Garry Kravit, whose nephew David Buist was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, called the star a 'comedic Mother Theresa'. The best medicine: Robin Williams in Patch Adams, where he played a doctor who helped patients by making them laugh. The actor showed extaordinary kindness to real-life child patients . David bravely decided that he wanted to see a new Ronald McDonald House - a charity that provides accommodation for families with children in hospital - built in New York before anything happened to him. Kravit met Williams at an event and asked him for autographed items for their fund-raising efforts. Williams went much farther and started calling David to help keep his spirits up as his condition deteriorated. 'When David was suffering at his worst, Robin would call him to perk him up. David treasured Robin's calls and it helped to push him forward,' Mr Kravit said. Williams even invited the pair to a filming of a comedy special in New York in 2004. Pictured, Robin Williams with his daughter Zelda Williams. Right, in his hit role as Mrs Doubtfire, the favorite film of cancer sufferer Jessica Cole, who spent the day with him just two months before she died . 'He hugged him and spent 20 minutes with him. He didn't care about anything but David,' Kravit told CNN. Buist eventually beat his cancer and is now married with children. Numerous stories about his kindness have emerged since his apparent suicide. Susan Jeffer was an extra hired to play golf in the background of Old Dogs, starring Robin Williams. After filming had finished, the strap on her golf bag broke and she had to carry it across the course in the hot sun. The only person to help her was the Oscar winner, who, knowing she would get in trouble if she was seen being helped by the star, carried the bag but handed it back just before they reached the rest of the actors and crew. She said: 'He really saved me that day. I'll never forget it.'","The father of Jessica Cole, who died of brain cancer in 2004, has recalled how Robin Williams chartered a private plane to visit his dying daughter .

"Rome (CNN) -- Judges in the trial of the captain of the wrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia agreed Wednesday to his request for a new examination of the ship, Costa Cruises spokesman Davide Barbano told CNN from inside the court. Lawyers for Capt. Francesco Schettino had asked the panel of three judges on Monday for permission to tour the ship's bridge and engine room as part of a defense strategy he says will prove Schettino was not the only person responsible for the disaster. The move could delay the legal process for months. INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised . Schettino's defense is trying to prove that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to the loss of 32 lives during the evacuation. A special team of divers will have to examine parts of the ship which are still under water, including the engine room and watertight doors. The liner, which crashed on the rocks off Giglio Island in January 2012, was rotated back to vertical last week after well over a year resting on its side. The unprecedented maneuver, called parbuckling, exposed a twisted mass of metal dotted with mattresses, passenger luggage and deck chairs on the ship's previously submerged starboard side. Now that the Concordia is upright, there can be further investigation of the captain's alleged mishandling of the ship. Defense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship. How cruise ship tragedy transformed an island paradise . Prosecutors are expected to argue that Schettino's decision to take the cruise liner off course is what caused the loss of life, not secondary mistakes or malfunctions. Schettino also argued Monday that Indonesian helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin's failure to understand his command to turn away from the rocks led to the crash. Rusli Bin and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements.","Judges agree to a request for a new examination of the Costa Concordia .

"(CNN)  -- Jose Mourinho has admitted that he is likely to take over at Real Madrid, in an attempt to become the first coach in history to win the Champions League with three different clubs. In the aftermath of Inter Milan's 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich on Saturday, Mourinho made a point of going over to the Inter fans, appearing to wave goodbye to them in the process, and the Portuguese later confirmed to reporters that he is expecting to be at the Santiago Bernabeu on a more regular basis next season. Although Manuel Pellegrini continues to be coach of Real, speculation surrounding Mourinho's probable appointment intensified in the days leading up to the Champions League final -- and the former Chelsea manager finally revealed that all the speculation had been true.

Although he stopped short of saying he will definitely be charge in of Real Madrid next season, Mourinho then added: ""I don't know the (Madrid) project yet, so I have to hear the project, but at the moment I am not the coach of Real Madrid; I am the coach of Inter and a very proud coach of Inter. ""Inter remains an option and I have a fantastic family here, but Real is the best option I have. The percentage of me leaving is higher than that of staying."" ""Madrid is an enormous club, a club that wants the same as me; I want to win, I want to feel important, I want to keep winning.""

"(CNN) -- The fourth typhoon to hit the Philippines in a month came ashore east of the capital, Manila, on Saturday morning, bringing heavy rain, flooding, and washing away shanty houses near the coast. Typhoon Mirinae quickly moved west into the South China Sea and became a tropical storm. It was forecast to continue due west and then take a slight turn south, hitting Vietnam in about 48 hours, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. There were power flashes across Manila, as the storm hit Saturday and cut the electricity supply, videographer James Reynolds said. The storm was weaker than expected, he said, but it still brought fierce winds and lots of rain. ""The wind and the rain and the floods have still caused quite a considerable amount of damage, certainly in the southeastern portion of the city, which is where we were,"" Reynolds told CNN by phone from Manila. ""We saw many shanty-type houses that had been washed away and residents frantically try to get hold of their household material."" Are you there? Share photos, video of the weather . The storm dropped at least 85 millimeters (3.3 inches) of rain on Manila. The city of Daet, on the eastern coast, received 149 millimeters (5.8 inches) of rain, and Virac, which sits on an island that juts into the Pacific, received 72 millimeters (2.8 inches) of rain. Watch water and wind pummel islands . The first of the four typhoons to batter the Philippines happened in late September, when Ketsana drenched the island nation with its heaviest rainfall in 40 years. Eighty percent of Manila flooded and more than 420 people died. See images from Mirinae . Flooding from Ketsana has lasted well into October, and tens of thousands of people are still in evacuation centers, according to the disaster coordinating council. On October 3, Typhoon Parma made landfall in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon, the largest of the Philippine islands. It destroyed 55,000 houses and killed more than 430 people. Last week a third typhoon, Lupit, narrowly missed making landfall but still brought lots of rain to the Philippines.","Storm hits Saturday, cuts electricity supply, videographer says .

"(CNN) -- Jeremy Lin has taken the basketball world by storm, but boxing star Floyd Mayweather Jr. claims the hype surrounding the NBA's new sensation is based on his ethnic background rather than his talent. Lin has had a fairytale rise to fame after inspiring the New York Knicks to a five-game winning streak and scoring a record 109 points in his first four starts for the team -- surpassing the mark previously set by Allen Iverson. But undefeated WBC welterweight champion Mayweather has suggested the ""Linsanity"" sweeping America is because pointguard Lin is the first U.S.-born NBA player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent. ""Jeremy Lin is a good player but all the hype is because he's Asian,"" Mayweather wrote on micro-blogging website Twitter. The NBA's breath of fresh air . ""Black players do what he does every night and don't get the same praise."" Lin graduated from Harvard University and initially failed to get drafted into the NBA, but he was signed by the Golden State Warriors as a free agent in July 2010. He moved to New York in December after being dropped by the Houston Rockets and outshone the legendary Kobe Bryant by scoring 38 points as the Knicks beat the Los Angeles Lakers 92-85 on Friday. Mayweather, who will fight Puerto Rico's Miguel Cotto in Las Vegas in May before starting a 90-day jail sentence for domestic abuse, said he was speaking up for other players in the NBA. Why Jeremy Lin's race matters . ""Other countries get to support/cheer their athletes and everything is fine,"" the 34-year-old said. ""As soon as I support black American athletes, I get criticized. ""I'm speaking my mind on behalf of other NBA players. They are programmed to be politically correct and will be penalized if they speak up."" Lin and the Knicks will attempt to extend their winning run to six games when they play the Toronto Raptors at the Air Canada Center on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- President Obama delivered his State of the Union address and said -- again -- that this is the year he intends to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. As President, he has promised this before, first in his inaugural address in January 2009 and then periodically reiterated over the years. As I write this, I am en route to the prison that Amnesty International once dubbed the ""Guantanamo Gulag."" One might quibble over the term, but the profile of the place is extraordinary. When I first went there in 2004, I expected to find ""the worst of the worst"" terrorists in the world, as then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had promised. Instead, I was hard-pressed to find people who were America's enemies. The Pentagon has effectively conceded this -- 624 men have long since been set free, and 77 of the remaining 155 men have been cleared for release for at least four years, some for much longer. The majority of my clients have been cleared for release by the Obama administration's 2009 Task Force, which requires unanimous agreement by no fewer than 6 federal agencies including the FBI, the CIA, and the Departments of Defense and State. There can be no other prison in the world where 50 percent of the inmates are told: ""You are cleared to leave, but you cannot go."" I hope to visit five of my remaining clients, although some may not come to the meeting. All are depressed and (for the questionable privilege of seeing me) had to endure for a time what the military dubbed a ""scrotum search"" -- an intentionally humiliating exploration of the genital area, which is intended to deter prisoners from coming to a legal visit to complain about the conditions. One person who will come out is Shaker Aamer, the last British resident there. Shaker does not like what he had to endure, but he told me recently that the procedure was ultimately more humiliating for the soldiers who must carry out such benighted orders. After all, who joined the proud U.S. military in order to become a ""Scrotum Searcher, First Class?"" He has been cleared since 2007, and hopes that it will not be too long before he can return to London, finally, to meet his youngest son Faris, who was born on the day Shaker arrived at Guantanamo Bay: Valentine's Day 2002. Shaker is depressed. The President's broken promises have weighed heavily on all the detainees. As anyone can understand, it is easier to endure the certainty of abuse than to oscillate between hope and despair. The President is correct when he argues that Guantanamo is a recruiting sergeant for extremism. He is right to say that America loses credibility, and inspires disdain, when we fail to adhere to our principles. The President is also justified when he blames the Republicans for undermining his pledge to erase the blot of Guantanamo from the reputation of this country. However, President Obama is arguably the most powerful person on the planet and his team should not promote the myth that the cleared prisoners cannot be set free -- Shaker could join his wife and four children in London tomorrow; those of us who have worked on the issue for 12 years can help ensure the smooth repatriation of others to their own homes and families. Equally to the point, the most powerful man on Earth could tell the military to stop humiliating prisoners who want to talk to their lawyers, and to end the violent and torturous practice of force-feeding those who peacefully protest their indefinite detention by hunger-striking. Over a 30-year career, I have visited most of the major prisons across the U.S. South, institutions that house death row or a maximum security unit, and none treats the prisoners as badly as Shaker suffers in Guantanamo Bay. The President could also advise me what I am meant to say next week, when my clients inevitably ask me -- as they always do -- why they are still being held despite the multiple findings that they pose no threat and can be transferred out of the hell they are living daily.

"London (CNN) -- As western countries remain mired in financial turmoil, business people are looking to get a foothold in China, hoping to tap its growth and expanding middle class. Solid economic expansion, coupled with a rapid market transformation and a series of government reforms, mean China -- the world's second-largest economy -- is no longer just a country for low-cost manufacturing. It is also an increasingly attractive destination to do business. Several western companies -- including global giants such as Starbucks, Volkswagen, Boeing and Procter & Gamble -- have established a presence in the country. But despite China's increasing influence, challenges remain for those looking to do business in the country. Intense competition, corruption, business etiquette and language are some of the barriers that can be faced. Here are five things you should know before doing business in China. A mosaic of markets . China is the world's most populous nation, with its sprawling 1.3 billion people making up a highly diverse market. ""There is no such thing as the Chinese market,"" says Martin Roll, a business and brand strategist who provides advisory to global and Asian brands on China. ""You have to look at China more like a mosaic of cultures,"" he adds. There is no single consumer profile, and analysts suggest companies remain flexible and innovative, while understanding how their company would fit in each specific market. ""You need people who've been in the market, you talk to trade associations, you talk to trade promotion bodies, you talk to people and bit by bit you get to understand the dynamics,"" says Stephen Perry, president of the 48 Group Club, an independent business network promoting business relations between China and the UK. ""There's no simple answer in China -- it depends so much upon the specific market and upon the specific characteristic of your own company,"" he adds. Business culture and etiquette . Operating in a country with a history of thousands of years -- and ways of doing business that go back as far -- it is valuable to develop insight into China's business culture and social etiquette to avoid misunderstandings that could scuttle deals and harm working relationships. One key aspect of Chinese culture is the concept of ""face."" In ""China Uncovered: What you need to know to do business in China,"" professor Jonathan Story describes face as a mix of public perception, social role and self-esteem than has the potential to either destroy or help build relationships. Story says that a foreign CEO can give face by attending meetings, accepting invitations, providing suitable expensive gifts and showing sensitivity to Chinese culture. In contrast, entrepreneurs can lose face by insulting someone in public, refusing invitations and gifts or by behaving inappropriately, like losing their temper or crying -- acts that are seen as lack of self-control and weakness. Business outsiders can impress with their knowledge of local customs, acknowledging hierarchy, offering gifts, addressing people by their designation -- especially when dealing with state representatives -- and appreciating the food. Such awareness of cultural nuances illustrate respect and sincere interest, says Roll. On the flip side, Chinese business people generally respect cultural differences and won't expect westerners to be fully customized to their tradition, analysts say. ""At the end of the day, the Chinese are very pragmatic,"" says Perry. ""If you have something they want, they'll do business with you no matter whether you can hold chopsticks or not."" Jack Perkowski, a Wall Street veteran who's often referred to as ""Mr China"" for his entrepreneurship in the Asian country since 1993, says developing mutual trust is key to success in doing business in China. ""The most important thing is, whoever you're meeting with or whoever you're dealing with, to treat them with respect,"" he says. Taking a market-based approach . Western businesses looking to tap the Chinese market should be aware of local preferences, and adapt accordingly. For example, Starbucks started serving green tea lattes in a bid to get a traditionally tea-drinking nation hooked on coffee; McDonald's adapted its menu to include items like spicy chicken wings and chicken burgers in an effort to appeal to local tastes. ""No matter how good you think your product is, no matter how well it sells in the UK, the United States or anywhere else, you need to really look at that product in the context of China and say is that the right product, is it too high-priced, do we need to do something different, do we need to adapt?"" says Perkowski. Procedures in China take time, patience and money . Western companies looking to tap China also need to show a long-term approach that will prove that they're in the country to stay, analysts say. ""It's very important when a western company tries to go to China they have to realize that success in China takes time, it requires patience and it costs a lot of resources,"" says Roll. Perry says that people have got to be very open-minded about anticipating what China is going to be in the coming decades. ""(China) is growing in the field of consumer goods and it will grow fast so people have got to find a way to match the future impact of China with the current characteristics of China,"" he says. Build a strong local team . Newcomers wanting to crack China will need to move, get someone from their organization to relocate or find an experienced group to represent them, says Perkowski, who's also the author of ""Managing the Dragon: How I'm Building a Billion Dollar Business in China."" ""When you're just starting, you've got to recognize there's going to be a limit to what you can do travelling back and forth to China,"" he adds. ""You'll never going to get a deal done [without basing yourself there]."" Surrounding yourself with local talent can help you break deals, understand the culture and the complexities of the market as well as compensate for the language barrier for those who don't speak Mandarin, analysts say. ""The only way you are going to ultimately be successful is by putting together a good team,"" says Perkowski.","China is home to a growing middle class with a big appetite for consumer goods .
Western firms looking to tap China should be innovative and flexible, analysts say .
They also need to adopt a long-term approach and build a strong local team .
Competition, corruption, business etiquette and language are some of the hurdles .",69235e0fa71b5c4cc8c5d904c66c4977b012ebc2
"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- President Obama began his ""town hall"" event at Facebook's offices on Wednesday with an anecdote. ""I hate to tell stories about Mark,"" Obama said, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was moderating the session. As if the two former Harvard students were old friends, Obama then launched into a brief retelling of a dinner party he atttended in February with the 26-year-old computer whiz and about a dozen other tech-industry elites. There, Zuckerberg sat to the president's immediate right. ""I'm the guy who got Mark to wear a jacket and tie,"" Obama said, referring to Zuckerberg, who abandoned his usual T-shirt and hoodie ensemble that day. ""Halfway through dinner, he's starting to sweat a bit. It's really uncomfortable for him. I helped him out of his jacket. ""In fact, if you want Mark, we can take our jackets off."" And so, like Obama has often done during less-formal speeches, the president on Wednesday removed his coat. Zuckerberg followed, revealing a dress shirt and black tie. (Though, he did wear sneakers.) ""Yeah, you're a lot better at this than me,"" Zuckerberg joked. That kicked off a very cordial hour-long conversation and seemed to loosen up the sometimes chilly technology prodigy. Zuckerberg stumbled during his opening remarks. ""Sorry, I'm kind of nervous,"" he said after a flub in his introduction. For Obama, Wednesday was a chance to connect with both Silicon Valley influencers and young people in one poke. Throughout his answers, Obama related his typical talking points -- federal deficit, education, healthcare and immigration -- to those two groups. To the technorati, Obama promoted education in math and sciences, highlighted the especially acute real-estate market in the affluent area here, and talked up immigration reform. ""We don't want them starting Intel in China, or starting Intel in France. We want them here,"" he said. To the youthful audience of Facebook employees, he provided advice and stirred his familiar call for change. ""Historically, part of what makes for a healthy democracy, what is a good politics, is when you have citizens who are informed, who are engaged. And what Facebook allows us to do is make sure this isn't just a one-way conversation,"" Obama said. For Facebook, the meeting was an opportunity to validate itself in the eyes of Washington, where it's ramped up lobbying efforts recently. That's important for most companies growing at the rate and size Facebook is. Zuckerberg has already proven himself to 500 million people who use the service and to wealthy investors. The Facebook founder is worth $13.5 billion, according to data from Forbes. That fact provided an opening for another ribbing from Obama, when discussing the president's proposal for ending tax cuts for the wealthy. ""People like me and you, Mark, (should be) paying a little more in taxes,"" Obama said. ""I know you're OK with that."" Despite the president's plan to take more of Zuckerberg's money, the young billionaire praised Obama's efforts in education reform. ""I think that the Race to the Top stuff that you guys have done is one of the most under-appreciated and most important things that your administration has done,"" Zuckerberg told the president. For his part, Zuckerberg announced in September that he would donate $100 million to Newark, New Jersey, public schools. Obama has commended Facebook in past speeches, including in his State of the Union address in January. He placed Zuckerberg's creation in a pantheon of great American ingenuity success stories, beside the inventors of the light bulb and the airplane. ""We're the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook,"" Obama said in that speech. ""In America, innovation doesn't just change our lives. It is how we make our living."" Facebook indicated in statements leading up to Wednesday's event that this was not an endorsement for the president. Likewise, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on the flight over here that the event was not meant to be a promotion for Facebook. ""This is not about endorsing a specific company,"" Carney said. ""It's about accepting an invitation for a forum to speak to the American people."" People traveling on Air Force One watched ""The Social Network,"" the controversial movie about the founding of Facebook, Carney said. Facebook did, however, offer a gift to Obama at the end of the event. It was a sweatshirt with the website's logo stamped on the front -- ""in case, for some reason, you want to dress like me,"" Zuckerberg said.","At a Facebook event, President Obama repeatedly poked fun at Facebook's founder .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- America's first female four-star general has been nominated, the Pentagon announced Monday. Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody was nominated to be America's first four-star female general. President Bush nominated Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody to serve as head of the Army's supply arm. By law women are excluded from combat jobs, the typical path to four-star rank in the military. ""This is an historic occasion for the Department of Defense and I am proud to nominate Lt. Gen. Ann Dunwoody for a fourth star,"" said Defense Secretary Robert Gates. ""Her 33 years of service, highlighted by extraordinary leadership and devotion to duty, make her exceptionally qualified for this senior position."" The Senate must approve the nomination. Dunwoody, a native of New York, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1975 after her graduation from the State University of New York in Cortland. She also holds graduate degrees in national resource strategy and logistics management. She became the Army's top-ranking woman in 2005 when she received her third star and became deputy chief of staff for Army logistics. ""I am very honored but also very humbled today with this announcement,"" said Dunwoody. ""I grew up in a family that didn't know what glass ceilings were. This nomination only reaffirms what I have known to be true about the military throughout my career ... that the doors continue to open for men and women in uniform."" The Army Materiel Command handles all material readiness for the Army. During her career, Dunwoody has been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, 10th Mountain Division and the Defense Logistics Agency. She served with the 82nd Airborne in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. She has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, Master Parachutist Badge and the Army Staff Identification Badge. The first woman to become a general officer in the U.S. armed services was Brig. Gen. Anna Mae Hays, chief of the Army Nurse Corps, who achieved the rank in 1970 and retired the following year. Elizabeth Hoisington, the director of the Women's Army Corps, was promoted to brigadier general immediately after Hays. She also retired the following year. Maj. Gen. Jeanne M. Holm, the first director of Women in the Air Force, was the first woman to wear two stars, attaining the rank in 1973 and retiring two years later. In 1996, Marine Lt. Gen. Carol A. Mutter became the first woman to wear three stars. Mutter retired in 1999. Currently, there are 57 active-duty women serving as generals or admirals, five of whom are lieutenant generals or vice admirals, the Navy's three-star rank, according to the Pentagon.","Bush nominated Lt.

"Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia (CNN)A 10-minute warning sounds and everyone jumps into action. More bodies are on the way. Red Cross and hospital workers run to the front of the hospital in Pangkalan Bun, not even certain how many victims are coming. Sirens then announce the arrival of the remains of two innocent souls lost on AirAsia Flight QZ8501. Unfortunately, this little town in Indonesia's central Kalimantan Province has become the focal point for the recovery of bodies and debris from the airliner, which failed to complete its journey from Surabaya, the country's second-biggest city, to Singapore on Sunday. Orange body bags are loaded onto gurneys and rushed to a separate, private wing of the hospital. The unmistakeable smell of death lingers long after the victims have passed. Their bodies are then cleaned and treated with chemicals to preserve them. It must be a gruesome and heartbreaking job. Identification . This is where the initial identification effort begins. Hospital staff assess gender, height, identifying marks and any clothing. But as time passes, the most obvious test -- facial recognition -- becomes increasingly difficult. ""Because they have been in the water some days, the bodies are bloated, but otherwise intact,"" says Suyuti Syamsul, director at the Sultan Imanuddin Hospital. He's been at the hospital 24 hours a day, he tells CNN, to ensure the bodies are afforded the respect they deserve. This hospital is not equipped for a tragedy on this scale. They usually have three morticians. They now have 40 staff and 20 volunteers focused on treating the bodies. The facility's other patients look on at the growing tragedy that has unfolded in this small town. Temporary caskets are being hastily made, some literally around the corner from where the bodies are being prepared. Respect . Syamsul says they will have 162 coffins, one for each victim of the doomed flight. He says they are paying the victims every respect possible. Representatives of six different religions pray over the bodies before they leave. The victim's religion may not be known, but customs must still be observed. ""Their time on earth is over,"" says Pastor Sirdjon Palace. ""So many of our prayers are for the family. We ask God to receive their bodies and give the families strength."" A further six bodies arrived at Sultan Imanuddin hospital throughout Friday. Suyuti says 14 bodies have now come through the hospital so far. As the victims' remains are transported out by ambulance to be flown to Surabaya -- for formal identification by distraught families -- the hospital team takes a breath but just for a moment. The search, to the south of Pangkalan Bun, is slow going, hampered by rough seas, which complicate the job done by divers. With only ten victims recovered from the Java sea so far, there remain many more that will come through these gates, to be tended to by the small but dedicated group of workers here. On standby 24 hours a day, just waiting for the next ten-minute warning.","Red Cross and hospital workers in Pangkalan Bun, Indonesia receive bodies from downed airliner .

"Attorneys for the family of a 17-year-old student found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at a southern Georgia high school called on authorities Thursday to release surveillance video that they say could show what happened. Kendrick Johnson, they allege, was slain in January -- counter to authorities' conclusions that the three-sport athlete suffocated in the mat while reaching for a sneaker. ""There is one eyewitness that we know is available -- it is the video recordings made from surveillance cameras there in the gymnasium where the body was found,"" attorney Chevene B. King Jr. told reporters in Valdosta, Georgia. ""For some unknown reason, this tape has been withheld,"" he added. Gym mat death shocker: Body stuffed with newspaper . Attorney Benjamin Crump, who recently joined the case after representing the family of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, said that Johnson was ""murdered, and we intend to get to the truth of what happened."" Johnson was found dead at Lowndes County High School in Valdosta on January 11, his body resting headfirst in the rolled wrestling mat. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia, and the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office determined the death was accidental. But a second autopsy, which a private pathologist conducted at the request of Johnson's parents in June, found that he died because of ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma."" Teen's death not accidental, family's autopsy finds . The Lowndes County sheriff has declared the case closed, and the U.S. Justice Department said in September that it wouldn't open a civil rights investigation. But Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for the district that includes Valdosta, is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation. 'Getting to the facts' King acknowledged Thursday that Moore's office has surveillance material from the school and that he believes Moore is ""making every effort to establish what in fact the ... tapes may show."" Still, King said, he doesn't know whether Moore has all the relevant tapes, and he said his team should be permitted to see them -- which he said hasn't yet happened. ""I'm (awaiting) some word from (Moore) as to whether or not"" he'll release the tapes to the team, King said. Moore released a statement saying that ""this is about getting to the facts and the truth, and we want the Johnson family and the community of Valdosta to have confidence in the process."" ""I am cognizant of time, and we continue to move the process along,"" he said. King and Crump, watched by a few dozen supporters of Johnson's family, made their comments on what would have been Johnson's 18th birthday. Before the news conference, the supporters held signs calling for answers in the death, and chanted refrains like: ""No justice, no peace!"" Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, spoke briefly, asking authorities to give his son ""a good present today."" ""Give us the videotape,"" Kenneth Johnson said. Internal organs removed . The attorneys' plea also came after Johnson's parents told CNN this week that their son's body and skull had been stuffed with newspaper before burial. That discovery was made during the second autopsy in June. The private pathologist,  Dr. William R. Anderson with Forensic Dimensions in Florida, told CNN that every internal organ from the pelvis to the skull was gone when he opened up the teen's remains. ""We have been let down again,"" Kenneth Johnson told CNN. ""When we buried Kendrick, we thought we were burying Kendrick, not half of Kendrick."" During an autopsy, internal organs are generally removed and examined before being returned for burial. GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang told CNN that after the first autopsy, ""the organs were placed in Johnson's body, the body was closed, then the body was released to the funeral home."" The funeral home would not comment to CNN. But in a letter to the Johnsons' attorney, funeral home owner Antonio Harrington said his firm never received the teen's organs. Harrington wrote that the organs ""were destroyed through natural process"" due to the position of Kendrick Johnson's body when he died, and ""discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to Valdosta."" A prosector dissects the body for pathological examination. King said Thursday that his team would take a close look at what happened to the body between the first autopsy and the burial.","Attorney: ""For some unknown reason, this tape has been withheld""

Skinny singer Katy Perry is the latest in a long line of stars to admit to wearing Spanx shapewear. But unlike most body-conscious celebrities who say they wear the control pants for a smooth line under their clothes, the 28-year-old singer has revealed that she wears them because she can't be bothered to go to the gym. 'I almost always wear Spanx,' said Perry. 'I like to say I train watching CNN but I don't. So I'm like ""I guess I'm not fitting into this dress for these couple of months.""'

"(CNN) -- In what's become an annual rite, thousands of diehard fans of Apple's iconic smartphone endured long overnight lines outside Apple retail stores around the world to be among the first Friday to buy the new iPhone 5. Kelson Horton, 39, had been in line at Lenox Square mall in Atlanta since 5 p.m. Thursday. The truck driver from Jonesboro, Georgia, said he's done so for every iteration of the smartphone that Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced to the world in 2007. ""I've been doing it since Day One,"" Horton said. ""It's the experience more than anything. It just happens to be the hottest phone on the market."" Near the front of a line of about 200 people Friday morning, Horton said he got about an hour's worth of sleep while meeting new friends from what he called ""the iPhone family."" At 8 a.m. local time across the U.S., thousands who spent hours waiting in line were greeted with cheers as Apple stores and other retailers began selling the new phone. More than 800 people were already in line outside the flagship glass-cube Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York City by the time the store opened Friday morning. Dozens of people there had been in line since Monday. Initial demand for the phone, at least in the U.S., appears to be stronger than for previous models. One analyst estimated that based on counts at Apple Stores in New York, Boston and Minneapolis, the lines Friday were, on average, 83% longer than those for the iPhone 4S last October. Those iPhone shoppers (or ""fanboys"" and ""fangirls"" as they're called by less-supportive tech enthusiasts) in the U.S. weren't the first, though. Throngs of shoppers lined up outside Apple stores in Sydney, Australia; Tokyo; London; Paris; and Munich, Germany, among other cities where the phone went on sale. Hundreds of cold and tired but excited customers were lined up outside the Apple store on London's Regent Street Friday morning. Many had been waiting outside the store all night without food or anything to sit on, but the general consensus seemed to be that the hassle had been worth it. ""I've been waiting since midnight, so 12 hours now,"" said Fahir Wardak, a 21-year-old student. ""I haven't really eaten but it wasn't that cold and I've got some tea now so it's alright."" And why was his 12-hour wait necessary? ""I've already got the iPhone 4S and a MacBook Pro so it's like having a collection really,"" he added. ""You just want to keep going along with it."" ""I'm actually from Canada and just missed my flight home to be here,"" said another London customer, Mohammed Farooqi, a 19-year-old student. ""I'm not sure how much it's going to cost me to get a new flight but seeing as the previous iPhone was so great I definitely think it's going to be worth it."" Others were less excited about the overnight wait for the sixth version of Apple's iconic smartphone. ""I've been here for around 11 hours but the queue kept moving so I couldn't go to sleep,"" said student Luna Zhang, 20. ""I had to take time off work to come here and really wish now that I'd just ordered it online."" Despite morning rainfall in Tokyo, hundreds of eager customers lined up outside an Apple store in the city's Ginza shopping district. Store employees handed out umbrellas to waiting customers, some of whom came sporting face paint to celebrate the occasion. ""It's almost like a festival, people just camping in the center of Ginza, just drinking and playing and talking to each other,"" said Taiyo Nakashima, a 34-year-old Web designer. ""It's not really just buying the phone; it's just enjoying the party, really."" In Sydney, customers camped out in tents and folding chairs. Cheers erupted when the store's doors opened. Todd Foot told CNN affiliate Network Ten that he waited for more than 70 hours to get Australia's first iPhone and review it online. Announced September 12, the iPhone 5 features a bigger screen, lighter and slimmer frame, faster processor and, for the first time, 4G LTE wireless connections. If a handful of tech writers were unimpressed with the specs, that didn't translate into lack of consumer interest. Apple took 2 million pre-orders for the phone in the first 24 hours they were available last week, and some analysts said they think it could sell more than 10 million by Monday. That first-day total was double the number of iPhone 4S pre-orders the company took last year, and an initial Friday shipping date was quickly pushed back. People who pre-order the phone now, or did so in the past few days, could be waiting more than three weeks for their phones to ship. The phone will roll out to 22 more countries on September 28. Gallery: The world's hottest smartphones . The most popular single smartphone since the existence of such a device, the iPhone has sold more than 244 million units around the world since its unveiling five years ago. According to research firm IDC, the iPhone and its iOS operating system make up 16.9% of the worldwide smartphone market, coming in behind the cluster of phones running the Android operating system, which account for 68.1% of the world's smartphones. The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the current version, the iPhone 4S. It has a 4-inch screen, measured diagonally, compared with a 3.5-inch screen on previous versions of the phone. It is the same width as the iPhone 4S but taller, and the iPhone 5 is made entirely of glass and aluminum. The new phone has had a few problems, as tech innovations sometimes tend to do. Users: Apple iOS 6 maps are a mess . Most notably, an update to Apple's mobile operating system has replaced Google Maps with an Apple-designed map service that many users say is less accurate or even omits locations altogether. Not surprisingly, those waiting in line Friday weren't deterred. ""I think a lot of people are wanting the world from a product they've just released,"" said Justin Henderson, 32, a composer from Atlanta who had been in line since 3 a.m. ""You've got to be patient with Apple, and they'll get it right. CNN's John Sutter in Atlanta, Yoko Wakatsuki and Alex Zolbert in Tokyo, Diego Lage in Hong Kong and Laura Mackenzie in London contributed to this report.","""It's almost like a festival,"" one customer in Tokyo says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The attorney representing two men suing John Travolta for alleged groping apologized Friday to Travolta's attorney for how one of the plaintiffs was wrong about the date of one alleged attack. That plaintiff, identified as John Doe No. 1, will remain in the federal lawsuit but will be represented by a different lawyer, attorney Okorie Okorocha told CNN. Travolta's attorney, Martin Singer, has said the actor denies the lawsuit's allegations that he groped two massage therapists while on their massage tables. The suit seeks $2 million in damages for each plaintiff. ""I want to apologize to Martin Singer. It must be very upsetting,"" Okorocha told CNN about how John Doe No. 1 provided the wrong date of January 16 for an alleged groping incident in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ""I believed I was on solid ground or I wouldn't have given the dates on any court papers or to Mr. Singer,"" said Okorocha, an attorney based in Pasadena, California. John Doe No. 1 ""needs a fresh lawyer to handle the case and we're working on that,"" Okorocha said. ""He needs someone to handle the case who hasn't made any mistakes."" The current petition will be amended once the new lawyer is hired for John Doe No. 1, and that lawyer would rewrite the section relating to that client, Okorocha said. John Doe No. 2 will still be represented by Okorocha and remain on the same lawsuit, the attorney said. This week, Travolta's lawyer argued a time-stamped photograph and a restaurant receipt show the actor was not in Los Angeles when John Doe No. 1 claimed the actor assaulted him. The plaintiffs are identified in court filings only as John Doe No. 1 from Texas and John Doe No. 2 of Atlanta, a move their lawyer says is allowed by federal law to protect victims. Travolta's lawyers know their names, Okorocha said. Singer said that Okorocha filed his clients anonymously to keep other people from recognizing them and coming forward with evidence against them. Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. Okorocha said much of his practice is focused on going after sexual predators. He said he is not intimidated by the prospect of going against Singer, a veteran lawyer known for aggressive tactics in his representation of ""A-list"" Hollywood clients. But Singer came out swinging against Okorocha this week, first questioning the suit's detailed description of the first incident in which Travolta allegedly groped John Doe No. 1 repeatedly and finally masturbated during the two-hour massage session in the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow. The suit claimed Travolta picked up the plaintiff in a black Lexus SUV and took him to a hotel bungalow where an African-American chef was cooking hamburgers. But Singer said that Travolta ""doesn't have a black chef, doesn't own an SUV or a Lexus. He drives a sedan."" And Travolta was in New York that day to be fitted for his wardrobe for his film ""Killing Seasons,"" Singer said. He arrived in the city on January 15, a day before the alleged assault in Beverly Hills, and remained there at least through the next day, he said. A photograph of Travolta, which Singer said was taken at the New York fitting, bears a digital timestamp of January 16 at 4:30 p.m., although the time zone was not specified. Singer also provided a receipt for a $382 meal at Mr. Chow, a Manhattan restaurant, apparently printed at 11:38 p.m. the same day of the alleged Beverly Hills assault. The merchant copy of the receipt does not include a signature. Earlier this week, Okorocha had stood by John Doe No. 1's account of the alleged January 16 assault. ""My client was sexually assaulted at 10 a.m.,"" Okorocha said this week. ""I can get there on horseback to Mr. Chow's in New York in 12 hours. That's not that remarkable."" He noted that Travolta is a licensed pilot with a private jet. The second plaintiff, who claims a similar encounter with Travolta occurred at an Atlanta hotel where he was a staff massage therapist on January 25, was added to the lawsuit Tuesday. Okorocha said the case should be easy to prove because of documentation that was done soon after the incident. ""He tells his boss, the employees all talk about it. There's e-mails going back and forth about the incident."" Responded Singer this week: ""This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one."" Singer said it was ""obvious"" that Okorocha ""checked media reports that my client was in Atlanta working on a movie"" before filing the second claim about an Atlanta incident, he said. ""However, the claim by Doe No. 2 is just as fabricated as the claim by Doe No. 1,"" Singer said. ""Our client will be fully vindicated in court on both of these absurd and fictional claims."" Unless Travolta accepts an out-of-court settlement, the actor can expect to testify in public and on camera about the allegations, Okorocha said this week. ""He's going to have a videotaped deposition with me asking him questions and if he goes to trial he is going be on the witness stand answering my questions,"" Okorocha said. ""That is far more intensive and productive as far as evidence than any police report will ever be."" The lawsuit alleges that Travolta called the first plaintiff, who advertises online with ""professionally themed ads,"" to arrange for a massage at $200 an hour. Travolta picked him up at a Beverly Hills address and drove him to the hotel, according to the lawsuit. When they entered the bungalow, Travolta ""shamelessly stripped naked"" in front of a professional chef and the plaintiff, the lawsuit states. ""For the first hour the massage was without incident, other than he kept purposefully sliding the towel down that covered his buttocks to reveal about half of gluteus area,"" the suit states. The massage therapist repeatedly slid the towel back up 10 times in the first hour, ""reminding Defendant that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage,"" the suit states. When Travolta ""started to rub Plaintiff's leg,"" he ""thought it was accidental,"" it said. Later, however, there was more touching by Travolta ""and this time Plaintiff told Defendant to please not touch him again,"" the complaint said. ""Defendant apologized, but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child,"" it said. The lawsuit then described Travolta allegedly touching and grabbing the massage therapist's penis. ""This was painful and uncomfortable,"" the suit said. Travolta apologized and suggested they ""must have gotten our signals crossed,"" and that he thought that the massage therapist ""wanted the same thing he did,"" it said. ""Defendant then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding."" Travolta then asked him to switch places on the table for a ""reverse massage,"" the lawsuit states. Travolta allegedly offered to perform a sexual act on the therapist. Although the therapist ""felt very afraid for his safety,"" he agreed to stay and continue with the massage after Travolta told him ""OK, I'll behave myself,"" the suit said. Travolta's statement ""gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control,"" the suit said. When he resumed with a deep tissue massage on his shoulders, Travolta told him, ""Say something nice to me,"" it said. Travolta, who allegedly began masturbating, then got up and screamed at the plaintiff ""how selfish he was; that Defendant got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his 'Welcome Back Kotter' days,"" the suit said. Hollywood is controlled by homosexual men ""who expect favors in return for sexual activity,"" the lawsuit document quotes Travolta as saying. ""Defendant then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most people throw up,"" it said. The complaint said Travolta told the therapist that ""he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it, and when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it."" When the therapist refused to take part, Travolta said, ""No problem. I will find new friends,"" the suit said. He then offered to call a ""Hollywood starlet"" who wanted ""three-way sex,"" but ""they needed to have sex together first before calling her, so this way they would be in-sync with each other sexually,"" the suit said. The actor told him he could ""make millions and be famous"" if he lost some weight and adapted to same-sex relations, the suit said. When the therapist threatened to call police if he was not returned to where he was picked up, Travolta drove him back, although calling him ""selfish"" and a ""loser"" on the way, it said. He paid the therapist $800, double the $400 owed for the two hours, the suit said.

"(CNN) -- Germany has canceled a decades-old agreement on information-sharing with Britain and the United States, in the wake of controversy sparked by American leaker Edward Snowden's disclosures about mass surveillance programs. Germany's Foreign Ministry announced the move Friday, saying it was effective immediately. Foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said cancellation of the pact -- which dates back to the late 1960s -- ""was a necessary and a correct consequence resulting from the latest debates in regards to protect privacy."" The move is largely symbolic but reflects the public pressure Germany's leaders have been under following the revelations by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency contractor. Europe furious, 'shocked' by report of U.S. spying . A UK Foreign Office spokesman said the 1968 agreement had been stopped after a request from Berlin. He described the arrangement as ""a bit of a loose end"" which ""hasn't been used since at least 1990."" The issue dominated a conversation last month between President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Other European nations, including France, have also voiced concern. All nations collect intelligence, Obama says . The White House last month promised joint EU-American discussions on the collection and oversight of intelligence, and questions of privacy and data protection. The row blew up after German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that classified leaks by Snowden detailed NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York, as well as an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has said that Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency operates within a strong legal framework. A UK parliamentary committee found last month that media claims GCHQ had made use of a U.S. mass surveillance program known as PRISM to illegally spy on UK citizens were ""unfounded.""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Gov. Rod Blagojevich from office. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich delivers a closing argument at his impeachment trial Thursday. Blagojevich was arrested on federal corruption charges in December. Federal authorities allege, among other things, that he was trying to sell or trade the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president. After the governor's arrest, the state House voted overwhelmingly to impeach him. The Senate vote was 59-0. Moments after removing him from office, the Illinois Senate also voted unanimously to prevent Blagojevich from ever holding political office in the state again.  Watch the impeachment vote » . ""I'm obviously sad and disappointed, but not at all surprised, by what the state senate did today,"" Blagojevich said during a free-for-all news conference outside his Chicago home during which he answered reporters' questions, hugged supporters and promised a neighbor's child he'll play basketball with him this summer. ""It's something I knew they would do a long time ago,"" he said. ""The fix was in from the very beginning.""  Watch Blagojevich's reaction to his impeachment » . ""As I've repeatedly stated, the governor must be held accountable for his actions to the legislature, in a court of law and to the people of the state of Illinois. ... Today's conviction speaks loud and clear that there are serious issues preventing him from fulfilling his responsibilities and I support putting new leadership in place."" In a written statement later Thursday, President Obama welcomed the end of the Blagojevich saga, at least as it played out at the statehouse. ""Today ends a painful episode for Illinois,"" he said. ""For months, the state had been crippled by a crisis of leadership. Now that cloud has lifted, I wish Governor Quinn the best and pledge my full cooperation as he undertakes his new responsibilities."" Shortly after the vote, newly minted U.S. Sen. Roland Burris, D-Illinois, who was appointed to the seat by Blagojevich, issued a statement saying he stands behind the state Senate's decision to remove the governor from office. Earlier Thursday, Illinois state senators made final deliberations in Blagojevich's impeachment trial. ""Honest and competent governors don't act like Rod Blagojevich,"" Republican Sen. Kirk Dillard said. ""Rod Blagojevich needs to be removed from office."" Sen. Kwame Raul, a Democrat, said the governor had not presented any evidence in his defense and had not called any witnesses. ""He had the opportunity, and it's a lie for him to say that he did not have an opportunity,"" he said. ""The governor presented absolutely no evidence in this case."" Elected officials in Illinois, who were forced to deal with the ugliness of the Blagojevich affair while many would have preferred to be celebrating the inauguration of Barack Obama, were quick to praise the Senate's action. ""Good riddance,"" U.S. Rep. Phil Hare, a Democrat, said in a written statement. ""The Blagojevich scandal has been a national embarrassment. I hope and pray that today's decision by the Illinois Senate will give our state the fresh start it so desperately needs."" The scene outside of the former-governor's Chicago home turned strange shortly after the vote. Within minutes, a media throng outside watched as the governor's state security detail got into their vehicles and left. A guard took a baby seat out of a van that had been used to carry the governor's family and left it outside of a garage. At the news conference, Blagojevich thanked Illinoisans, who elected him governor twice after terms as a U.S. representative and state lawmaker. ""I'm really here today to say how grateful Patti and I and our daughters ... are for the opportunity to be able to serve the people of Illinois as their governor for the past six years,"" he said. ""How blessed I personally feel to get up every day to fight for the average people."" The ex-governor finished his prepared comments and climbed the stairs to his home, then climbed back down to shake hands with neighbors. He then allowed reporters to crowd around and ask questions during an ad hoc news conference that lasted longer than his original statement. At one point, he walked up to at least two neighbor children, hugging them and asking, ""Do you want to be on TV?"" One of them asked, ""Will you play hoops with me this summer?"" Blagojevich answered, ""Absolutely."" After the conference, he again went into a crowd of onlookers to hug several members as people shouted things such as ""We still support you"" and ""Forgive and forget."" During the trial's closing arguments Blagojevich appeared before the senators, saying he had done ""absolutely nothing wrong.""  Watch Blagojevich make his case » . ""I'm here to appeal to you, to your sense of fairness, your sense of responsibility and to the truth,"" he said in a closing address that lasted less than an hour. It was the first time he had appeared at the impeachment trial, which began Monday. The governor firmly denied wrongdoing Thursday, as he has all week on television talk shows. ""If I felt I did something wrong, I would have resigned in December,"" he said. ""If I felt I violated a law, I would meet my responsibility, I would have resigned in December."" The governor, who did not use notes during his remarks, said the allegations against him were unproven. ""There hasn't been a single piece of information that proves any wrongdoing,"" he said. ""How can you throw a governor out of office with insufficient and incomplete evidence?"" As he did in his television interviews, Blagojevich railed against Senate trial rules that he said unfairly prevented him from presenting witnesses or evidence. After the governor's address, the Senate recessed for an hour before House prosecutor David Ellis gave a rebuttal to the governor's remarks. ""He could have put himself under oath and faced my questions,"" Ellis said. ""More importantly, much more importantly, faced your questions. But he didn't do that, did he?"" ""He talked more about the evidence with Barbara Walters on 'The View' than he did in this chamber today, where he's facing impeachment and removal from office,"" he said. Earlier, in his closing argument, Ellis said the governor had demonstrated an ""abuse of power"" throughout his tenure as Illinois' chief executive. Blagojevich railed against the trial on talk shows this week, calling it unfair and saying it sets a dangerous precedent. He has ignored trial deadlines and presented no evidence in his defense.  Watch as Blagojevich takes his fight to Larry King Live » . He told CNN's Larry King earlier this week that attending the trial ""would dignify an impeachment process that's wrong and contrary to every fundamental civil liberty that we as Americans enjoy.""

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- A pregnant British woman facing possible execution in Laos will go on trial this week, the country's foreign affairs ministry said Monday. Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison, according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve. Samantha Orobator ""is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking,"" said Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve, a London-based human rights group. Orobator, 20, was arrested on August 5, said Khenthong Nuanthasing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman. She was alleged to have been carrying just over half a kilogram (1.1 pounds) of heroin, Reprieve lawyer Anna Morris told CNN by phone from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. ""For that amount of heroin the sentence is normally the death penalty,"" she said. Orobator's mother Jane found out in January her daughter was pregnant -- more than four months after she was arrested, her mother said. Jane Orobator heard the news from the British Foreign Office, which has been monitoring the case, the mother told CNN by phone from Dublin, where she lives. She cannot believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking, and was surprised to learn she was in Laos, she said. ""I don't know"" what she was doing there, she said. ""The last time she spoke with me, she said she was on holiday in London and she would come to see us in Dublin before returning to the U.K. in July. ""She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs,"" she added. Reprieve is worried about her health, especially given her pregnancy, Anna Morris said. ""She became pregnant in prison. We are concerned that it may not have been consensual and we are concerned that someone who finds herself in prison at 20 is subject to exploitation,"" she said. She is due to give birth in September, the lawyer added. Reprieve sent Morris from London to Laos to try to help Orobator, Algar said. The lawyer arrived there on Sunday and is hoping to visit Orobator on Tuesday, her boss at Reprieve said. A British consul has also arrived in the country. ""Reprieve heard about her case two weeks ago. We had thought yesterday the trial was going to start today,"" Algar said Monday. ""We have now heard from Anna that it is not going to."" ""I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her,"" Morris said. ""She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her. We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one."" She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial. The last execution in Laos was in 1990, the foreign affairs spokesman said. British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell issued a statement about Orobator on Saturday. ""The British Government is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. We have made the Laos authorities aware of this at the highest levels in Samantha's case,"" he said. ""We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in regular contact with the Laotian authorities about her case. British Embassy officials, including the Ambassador, have visited her six times since her arrest,"" he said. ""In addition, Britain's consular representatives in Laos, the Australian Embassy, including the Australian Embassy doctor, have visited Samantha 10 times on our behalf,"" he said. There is no British Embassy in Laos. A British vice-consul arrived in the country this weekend, the Foreign Office said Monday. Rammell plans to raise the Orobator case with the Laotian deputy prime minister this week, he said. Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to London with her family when she was 8, her mother said. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Samantha Orobator facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Peruvian President Ollanta Humala has removed 30 of 55 generals in the national police, the largest such purge in the institution's history. The forced retirements, which were announced in the official gazette over the weekend, are widely seen as an attempt by Humala to combat corruption. Among those forced out was the head of the national police. The new head of the police, Raul Salazar, mentioned the need to fight corruption no less than six times during a speech at his induction ceremony. ""We have to uncover any act of corruption that stains the name of the police. From the most minimal to the most important, it doesn't matter, same if one sol or more are stolen,"" he said, referring to Peru's currency. In a separate interview on the state broadcaster Tuesday, Salazar said that fighting drug trafficking would remain a priority. The move means that until new generals are named, many regions in Peru, including many in the interior of the country, will be led by colonels instead of generals, something that opposition politicians have criticized. Critics also voiced concerns that the move was a ploy by Humala, as a new president, to place commanders loyal to him in the top posts. His interior minister, Oscar Valdes, said Tuesday that the retirements had to do with a reorganization of a bloated institution, the state-run Andina news agency reported. ""This is a studied measure, it is a re-engineering of the police,"" he said. ""It's not possible that the police has so many generals."" Before the purge, the police had 55 generals, 900 colonels, and more than 2,000 commanders, he said. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this report.","The Peruvian president sacked 30 out of 55 police generals .

"(CNN)  -- Manny Pacquiao returned home to a hero's welcome in his native Philippines on Friday after wresting the WBO welterweight title from Miguel Cotto on a 12th round technical knockout in Las Vegas. 'Pacman' has a fanatical following in the Philippines which has been further enhanced by his record breaking victory as he claimed his sixth world title at a different weight by beating Cotto on Saturday night. ""Welcome home, the world's bext boxer of all time,"" read a banner as thousands of fans greeted the 30-year-old. Following his hard-fought victory over Puerto Rican Cotto, all the talk is of a cash-rich superfight with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. next year. Leading promoter Bob Arum said he is ready to put the pay-per-view extravaganza at the 147-pound welterweight class, with Las Vegas the preferred venue. Pacquiao played down the possibility as he talked to reporters on his return. ""We are not forcing a fight with him. It is right that he is the one challenging me, because my fights score more on pay-per-view,"" he said. Pacquiao has greatly enhanced his reputation with successive wins over Oscar de la Hoya, Britain's Ricky Hatton and Cotto. Mayweather returned to the ring with a comfortable win over Juan Manuel Marquez and has the reputation for grossing massive receipts from his pay-per-view appearances. For the moment, Pacquiao will spend time at home with his wife, Jinkee, and three children and is also set to pursue his ambition to enter Filippino politics, standing for a congressional seat in his home island of Mindanao.","Manny Pacquiao returns home to Philippines after Las Vegas triumph .

"(CNN) -- West, Texas, isn't just a town. It's a family. That's why it hurt so much one year ago Thursday when an enormous explosion at a fertilizer plant claimed 15 lives while destroying 120 homes and damaging 200 others across 37 blocks, shattering windows well beyond that. The blast was earth-shattering, registering on seismographs as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake and shaking homes 50 miles away. The 10-foot crater the blast left behind pales in comparison to the holes left in the hearts of the town's 2,800 residents. ""No one's life was untouched,"" says Mimi Montgomery Irwin, owner of the Village Bakery, a local gathering spot. Everyone felt the blast: Those who buried loved ones and the neighbors who consoled them. The displaced students learning Shakespeare in trailers because their schools were condemned. Homeowners left without a home and the friends who took them in. Mayor Tommy Muska is ""not surprised at all"" by how his community came together. Some might attribute this spirit to the resiliency of the Czechs who helped settle and still help define the community. Others may credit the strong faith of its residents. Or it may be a product of life in a place where everyone knows everyone and won't leave their neighbors behind. It's telling that, in a town of 2,800, very few left. ""(Residents) pulled themselves up, shook themselves off and started moving forward."" Muska says. ""They just did what needed to be done."" Thanks to this hard work, this unity, these values -- not to mention well-placed, much-needed government assistance -- the mayor says, ""We're going to have a new normal someday."" But that day isn't here. And the old normal in West isn't coming back. Newly released video shows moment of deadly blast . War zone now a construction zone . Still, the evidence is everywhere that West is rising again. It is happening brick by brick, shingle by shingle, prayer by prayer. What once looked like a war zone is a construction zone. Already, 25 new homes are finished, with about 60 others nearing completion, according to the mayor. A new emergency services facility has replaced a tiny construction trailer. Work has begun on rebuilding the West Rest Haven, a nursing home and once one of the town's biggest employers. Downtown storefronts, which last year had boarded windows, are bustling with business. ""We can see something happening,"" says Dr. George Smith, West's director of emergency medical services. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel."" The view was hard to envision that fateful Wednesday night last spring. Smith was in West Rest Haven, where he is medical director, when the building's ceiling and windows collapsed on him. Somehow, he and the facility's residents were able to escape. The very next morning, city officials, including the mayor and several council members who themselves had been left homeless, went to work. Nonprofit groups from the Red Cross to faith-based groups to volunteers who just wanted to help flocked to the small town. In the three days after the blast, the Texas A&M Veterinary Emergency Team treated more than 120 animals -- horses, sheep, chickens and a cow and her calf in the field, household pets like dogs, cats, rabbits, even a bearded dragon -- says spokeswoman Angela Clendenin. Twelve months later, authorities still haven't pinpointed the cause of the blast, but an electrical malfunction, a spark from a golf cart or an intentional act haven't been ruled out. For now, the state fire marshal's office and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will only say their joint investigation ""is active and ongoing."" While nothing publicly has changed on the investigative front since May, the status of federal assistance took a big step forward in August when President Barack Obama's administration issued a disaster declaration that paved the way for funding for things like new infrastructure and millions of dollars for new schools. When they open in fall 2015, those new school buildings will be better than what they replaced. There will also someday be a park and memorial. The 120-bed nursing home is expected to be state-of-the-art. New infrastructure and homes likewise will be improvements. As Smith notes, ""In the long run, we're actually going to be better"" as a town in many ways. Muska concurs, while in the same breath adding: ""Anything we get as a benefit for this is too much a price to pay for the 11 firemen, two civilians who helped out and two civilians killed."" Loss of lives hits small town hard . In a community full of strong people, the mayor said among the strongest are the 13 women who lost their husbands. ""They are doing as well as can be expected,"" Muska says, acknowledging that Thursday's memorial may reopen some of the wounds. ""It's not going to ever go away. The sting of losing a loved one radiates long after they are gone."" Adds Montgomery Irwin, whose bakery specializing in kolaches and other Czech foods is a frequent meeting place for residents, ""Time does heal. But you don't forget."" Even with reconstruction abounding, she adds, ""From an emotional standpoint, it seems like it was just yesterday."" Some say the tragedy contributed to more than the initial loss of life. West Rest Haven's residents dispersed to about 10 facilities after the explosion, leaving their friends and caretakers behind. Over the past year, these elderly people died at about twice the rate that would have been expected, Smith says. ""People ask me if it had anything to do with the explosion,"" he says. ""And I say, 'Yes, it certainly does.'"" The loss of the nursing home didn't just affect its residents. Emil ""Sonny"" Fridel, 91, misses his almost daily trips to visit friends at West Rest Haven and misses the weekly masses there, according to his daughter, Mary Ann Kubacak. A reunion a few months ago cheered up the nursing home's former residents, as did the recent groundbreaking on the new facility. Their feelings are similar to many others displaced by the blast, Smith says: ""Most of them want to get back to West as soon as possible."" Ray Snokhous lost two cousins, both firefighters, in the explosion. A lawyer who returned a decade ago to West, where his father had been the town blacksmith, Snokhous says, ""It's difficult to put into words"" how his and other families are able to rebound emotionally. But reflecting on the town's history of settlers who fled oppression in Europe and of sending men like himself, a Korean War veteran, to serve in the U.S. military, Snokhous said the people of West have shown their resilience time and again. ""We're survivors,"" said Snokhous, who is the Czech Republic's honorary consul general in Texas. ""And we are also fighters. ... God gives us a wake-up call every so often, and we respond to it."" 'We will put it back together' Residents say their faith has been instrumental in understanding and dealing with last April's tragedy. Montgomery Irwin says the anniversary falling so close to Easter -- with its message of resurrection and renewal -- is especially appropriate for the people of West. Snokhous lauds not just his own Catholic church, but churches of other denominations that helped heal the mourning community. ""What I have seen is a community come together like (one) could have never imagined,"" he says. ""... We have the blessings of the life remaining. And we will put it back together."" Whoever one talks to, that word -- community -- comes up again and again. Notes Kubacak, who grew up in the town and still visits regularly, ""The people of West have always helped each other."" Montgomery Irwin was living and working in New York, where she was a vice president in Macy's marketing division, after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The scale of the destruction and suffering was immense, but even then there were many people in the city who didn't know anyone personally affected. That's not true for West, to which Montgomery Irwin returned seven years ago after her father's death. It's still a place where everyone seemingly runs into each other every day, be it at her bakery, the supermarket, the hardware store or church. A lot of people don't readily complain or ask for help, but they now more than ever realize their neighbors will open their doors, wallets and hearts when it's needed. What's most different now is that, through this terrible tragedy, people the world round have gotten to know West. It's not just a town on the east side of I-35, a dot on the map between Dallas and Austin. ""People know now that West is truly a place,"" says Montgomery Irwin. ""And actually, quite a special place."" CNN's Jason Morris and Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","15 died, hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged in West, Texas, blast last April .

Noting the delay in the project over the route alteration, Linder said: ""We're still saying six to nine months."" TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline from Canada's oil sands production in northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, is seeking approval for a new route east of the initially proposed route, which went over an environmentally sensitive aquifer. A State Department official told CNN on Thursday that the Obama administration has not received a new permit application for the proposed alternate route for the northern portion of the pipeline. When the department receives an application, the next step would be to coordinate with Nebraska and other states along the route as they assess the proposal, the official said on background. Linder, a Republican who is a political appointee, said it is up to TransCanada to submit a permit application to the State Department. The 1,700-mile pipeline, intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day, has become a political lightning rod in the United States. Last year, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013, citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the vital Ogallala  Aquifer, which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state's agricultural economy. Environmentalists fear a burst in the pipeline would allow oil to seep into the massive water table. Republicans accused President Barack Obama of putting off the issue until after the November election to avoid angering his environmental allies. They forced the addition of a provision to speed up approval of the project  in the December debt ceiling agreement despite warnings by Obama that the 60-day timeline for a decision would guarantee rejection. In February, the State Department -- which has authority over international pipeline projects -- rejected the proposal on grounds that there was no alternative route to examine. TransCanada said then it would submit a new proposal for the route through Nebraska. Supporters, including the oil industry, say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions. ""The stars are aligning for America's energy future and President Obama should make the right choice now and approve the entire Keystone XL pipeline,"" said Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil industry organization. ""The president's concerns about the sensitive Sand Hills area of Nebraska have been addressed. There are no more excuses. Mr. President, let's get this energy and job-creating project started now."" Opponents, including environmentalists, say that the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the United States into a particularly dirty form of crude oil that might ultimately end up being exported anyway. Under the timeline provided by Linder, hearings for public comment will be held and TransCanada will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route. ""We will have a significant amount of time for public comment,"" Linder said. ""... They'll refine the route they really want to focus on as a preferred route and then do a more in-depth analysis on the ground of the actual route."" Once TransCanada submits that final proposal to his department, it should take 30 to 60 days for the review to be completed and a draft supplemental impact statement prepared, he said. Regarding the State Department's role, Linder said the situation is unique because under normal circumstances, TransCanada would have an application pending. However, the initial application was rejected, so the company must file a new one. Republican leaders are pressuring Obama and Democrats to speed approval of the pipeline. ""With this new route submitted and the state of Nebraska acting to move forward, the president is running out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline any longer,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN on Wednesday, noting that a ""veto-proof majority"" in the House of Representatives supports the project. The House on Wednesday approved a Republican bill that aims to fast-track the Keystone project as part of another 90-day extension of federal transportation funding. The 293-127 vote allows Boehner to begin negotiations with Senate Democrats over a longer-term funding measure for road, rail and bridge projects. Obama announced in March that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Oklahoma -- a key repository of U.S. oil -- to the Gulf. He had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion, even when he blocked the full project. Currently, there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in Canada and North Dakota to refineries and terminals on the Gulf. That means Midwest refineries can pay lower prices to get it. Giving the Canadian oil easier access to the Gulf means the glut in the Midwest goes away, making it more expensive for the region, but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets.","A Nebraska official says reviewing a pipeline route usually takes six to nine months .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's new lawyer has a white rabbit's foot hanging from the handle of his Louis Vuitton briefcase. ""That's for good luck,"" Mark Heller said. ""Lindsay Lohan is a great beauty with tremendous talent and I believe that all she really needs in life is a little bit of luck."" A receptive judge, cooperative prosecutors and a good lawyer might help. But after six drama-filled years through the Los Angeles criminal court system, starting with two drunken driving convictions in 2007, Lohan may have exhausted her supply of those. She has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who found her in violation of probation five times and sentenced her to a total of six months in jail. Photos: Celebrity mug shots . The actress faces a March 18 trial that includes charges of lying to a police officer about a car crash, reckless driving and violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction. Lohan did face a receptive judge at a pretrial hearing Wednesday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner is the same one who found her guilty of stealing a necklace from a jewelry store and violating probation two years ago. She praised Lohan for completing the terms of her sentence a year ago when she lifted her supervised probation. Sautner retires next month, so another judge -- yet to be determined -- will preside over her trial. There are two prosecutors, including one from Santa Monica, where the car crash happened last June, and another from the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which is overseeing the shoplifting probation. While they've not taken a public position, several media reports -- not confirmed by CNN -- have said they want Lohan to spend at least six months in confinement. SXSW passes on Lindsay Lohan's 'Canyons'? Heller, who met with the prosecutors for the first time Wednesday, said they seemed to be ""very much interested in serving justice."" What would justice be in this case? Past justice for Lohan has included less than two weeks behind bars in her six trips to the Los Angeles County jail. Measures to relieve jail overcrowding led to her release after just hours in all but one of those visits. Lohan did spend 35 days confined to her Venice, California, home. She also served about 67 days of community service, mostly working at the L.A. County morgue. ""Justice always has to be tempered with mercy and jail is not always the answer,"" Heller said. ""When people find themselves coming before the court, there's usually a very serious underlying reason and cause."" In fact, Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances. She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered rehab stint after a failed drug test. Her father has been urging Lohan to enter rehab voluntarily ahead of her trial, hoping that would satisfy the judge and prosecutors. Lindsay Lohan: The reality show we don't want to watch . Heller said it was premature for him to talk about a plea deal with the prosecutors since he just got the case file Wednesday. While her previous lawyer, Shawn Holley, entered a not guilty plea on Lohan's behalf two weeks ago, Heller did not go as far as to suggest to reporters that she did not lie to police or violate her probation. Lohan took the bold move of firing Holley, who steered her through her many legal troubles over the past few years. She appeared reluctant, however, in court Wednesday when Judge Sautner asked her if she wanted to replace Holley. ""Today, yes,"" Lohan answered. Sautner approved the switch to Heller, a New York lawyer for 44 years, with the exception of a five-year suspension from practicing law for bar rules violations. Pitbull: LiLo doesn't even live here anymore . ""This is not the most complex case we've ever seen,"" Sautner said. But it could send Lohan to jail again. Sautner warned her a year ago that any violation of the law could mean she would have to serve 245 days in jail -- the remainder of her suspended sentence from a shoplifting conviction. While critics have panned Lohan's recent dramatic appearances as an actress -- her recent portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor is exhibit A -- defendant Lohan has consistently delivered drama. She caught a late flight from New York Tuesday night to be in Los Angeles for court Wednesday morning despite sending a doctor's note that said she was too sick to travel. ""Glad to see you're feeling better,"" Sautner told Lohan. ""Thank you,"" Lohan replied. Heller told the judge that her doctor diagnosed an upper respiratory condition. ""In New York, it's the flu,"" he said. ""No, it isn't,"" said Sautner, who was an NYPD detective in a previous career. ""The flu is the flu."" Still, the judge overlooked the issue, even saying that Lohan does not have to attend future hearings or even the trial, since it is misdemeanor case. Lohan proved she can still draw a crowd of paparazzi to court. Dozens of photographers captured her walk from the limo into the courthouse. And she was dressed appropriately for a media event, wearing a Chanel dress and her traditional red-soled Louboutin stilettos. ""She will rise to the occasion and I think she'll be fine,"" Heller told reporters.

"(CNN) -- On the wing of an empty airplane, a young boy is practicing his backward-bend. In the cockpit, a crowd have gathered -- taking it in turns to play captain. From an outsider's perspective, Goma International Airport -- once a makeshift arsenal for the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo -- is probably the last place you'd expect to find a makeshift playground. To locals, such dichotomies are typical of the once conflict-ridden region. ""For me this captures the Congo experience,"" says Michael Christopher Brown, a photojournalist who shot the images in 2012. ""On the one hand, this is a place that is often in the news as a very horrific place, because of course, very horrific things have happened there. But there are also beautiful things that happen there,"" he says. Years of war and a volcanic eruption in 2002 -- which saw much of the city and large swaths of the airport overrun with lava -- pretty much shut down any commercial activity at the site. Though Goma Airport essentially fell into disuse, the locals have made use of the leftover volcanic rocks -- from which many constructed their homes -- and the abandoned aircraft that pepper the place. ""While I was there, I saw children going through the planes, collecting parts and hacking at the engines to get the wires. My fixer, Horeb, said these materials were later sold on the street to be used in other products. A hunk of steel can be used in a stove, the wires could be used in other electronics. There, everything is recycled, in a way."" Even adults play make-believe . Outside of serving a utilitarian function, Goma Airport has acted as a kind of Fantasy Island for the locals -- inviting them to dream big even if their means were small. Horeb recalled a friend who had always wanted to be a pilot. ""His parents were too poor and all the schools were expensive, so he could not hold onto that dream,"" Horeb told Brown. When Mount Nyirangongo erupted, Horeb's friend was one of a hundred locals who rushed to move the planes before they got swallowed up by the encroaching lava. Emptied of fuel, food and passengers, the aircraft proved easy to shift. Horeb's friend jumped inside the plane to steer it while the others pushed -- briefly living out the dream he never got to see fulfilled. ""Horeb described the experience as exhilarating for his friend,"" recalls Brown. 'These images are unique' Brown was in Goma when the M23 rebels captured the city from the Congolese government. Though the site was manned by rebels, he says, that never prevented the local children from playing in the debris. ""If no planes were coming in, the troops would allow villagers to move across the runway with water and groceries,"" he recalls. They did not, however, grant him access to the site. When the rebels cleared out of the city, there was a short period when the airport was unmanned before Congolese government forces (FARDC) moved in. Brown took his opportunity. ""Really, these images are unique, because access is so difficult,"" he says. ""I saw this brief window when no one was at the airport. I saw the kids running around inside and decided to try one more time before I was blocked. This time, I was successful."" Since that first visit, a wall has been erected around the airport. ""After that one afternoon, we could not get access again,"" he recalls. ""With the wall there, I'm not sure if the kids are allowed in any more -- I can't see them.""","In 2012, children turned an empty airport in Congo into a makeshift playground .

"The Clintons left the White House more than a dozen years ago ""dead broke"" and in debt, according to Hillary Clinton, who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year. In a wide-ranging interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that aired on Monday, the former secretary of state also said that the deadly 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya,  would give her ""more of a reason to run"" for president again than a rationale for not doing so. The interview comes just as Clinton's new book, ""Hard Choices,"" about her years as Barack Obama's first secretary of state hits bookstores on Tuesday. It's the latest look at her storied career in the global spotlight as first lady, U.S. senator, presidential candidate and top diplomat. She made headlines in a clip of the interview that aired on ""Good Morning America"" in which she defended her hefty speaking fees, noting that she knew what it was like to experience tough financial circumstances in the winter of 2001. She said her family ""came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt,"" adding later that her family had ""no money"" at that time and ""struggled to piece together the resources"" for mortgages and her daughter Chelsea's college education. ""You know, it was not easy,"" she said. The Clintons departed the White House in debt due to enormous legal fees. By the end of 2000, their debt totaled somewhere between $2.28 million to $10.6 million. But former presidents and first ladies have the ability to make a lot of money, and the Clintons were no exception and have done so. Their assets grew quickly. Bill Clinton made more than $9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $9.5 million in 2002. They paid off their legal fees by 2004. A CNN analysis of the family's financial records in early 2013 showed that Bill Clinton had earned $106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind. In 2012 alone, he earned $17 million in fees. Although she regularly speaks for free at certain events, Mother Jones reported earlier this year that Clinton made roughly $5 million on the speaking circuit since stepping down as America's top diplomat. Clinton did not dispute the figure when Sawyer asked about it. Though not as profitable as her husband - who has made as much as $750,000 in one speech - Hillary Clinton reportedly commands $200,000 per speech. The two also have received hefty advances for their books. Hillary Clinton said the former first family eventually turned around their finances, noting that her husband has ""worked really hard and it has been amazing to me."" She noted that they had to pay off debts, get their houses arranged and ""take care of family members."" Clinton has become a staple on the paid speaking circuit. She has appeared before an array of audiences, including trade associations, business groups and college students. Asked if she thought Americans could understand making ""five times the median income in this country for one speech,"" Clinton said she ""thought making speeches for money was a much better thing than getting connected with any one group or company as so many people who leave public life do."" American Rising, the pro-Republican opposition research shop that along with the Republican National Committee, takes the lead in criticizing Clinton, was quick to ping her over her comments to ABC, saying they ""reveal someone who is extremely out of touch with financial reality facing Americans."" On its website, America Rising said the two homes the Clintons purchased after leaving the White House in Chappaqua, New York, and Washington cost around $4.5 million combined. On Benghazi, Republicans contend that the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and four Americans illustrates Obama administration foreign policy failures. Democrats say ongoing Republican-led scrutiny is political and designed to undercut any potential Clinton candidacy. ""I view this as really apart from - even a diversion from - the hard work that the Congress should be doing about the problems facing our country and the world,"" Clinton said, noting that the United States should be ""in the majors"" on world affairs. Clinton has taken responsibility for the attack in the past and she did so again in the clip released by ABC. But in this interview, Clinton defended herself by saying she ""was not making security decisions"" for the Benghazi compound. ""Well, I certainly would give anything on earth if this had not happened,"" Clinton said. ""And I certainly would wish that we had made some of the changes that came to our attention to make as a result of the investigation. But I also am clear in my own mind that we had a system and that system, of course, ended with me.""","The former secretary of state reportedly has made $5 million in speaking fees since leaving government .

"(CNN) -- It's not clear who might try to succeed Jan Brewer as governor of Arizona next year, but chances are good that whoever it is won't be quite as flamboyant. The finger-wagging, gun-loving politician, known as a firebrand who exhibits flashes of moderation, announced on Wednesday that she would ""pass the torch of leadership"" and not run for reelection. Her term ends in January. Feisty on immigration . A feisty Republican who rose up through local politics to the state's highest office, Brewer generated national headlines in recent years for her public opposition to President Barack Obama on border security and immigration reform. ""First entering public service as a mother concerned about the workings of her local school board, Governor Brewer has served with distinction at every level of state and local government over the last three decades,"" veteran Republican Sen. John McCain said Wednesday, calling her ""a great champion for our state."" As secretary of state, Brewer automatically ascended to the gubernatorial gig in 2009 when Gov. Janet Napolitano left the job to head the Department of Homeland Security under Obama. Brewer then easily won election to a full term in 2010. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer won't seek reelection . Just over a year into her tenure, she rose to national prominence by signing SB1070 into law. The strict immigration measure, also known as the ""show me your papers"" act, allowed law enforcement to ask people for legal documents. ""Show me your papers"" law . Critics complained the measure would lead to racial profiling, and the U.S. Supreme Court eventually struck down some provisions of it but left intact the controversial section allowing police to check immigration status while enforcing other laws. The issue gained Brewer the reputation of conservative firebrand, and she enhanced it in 2012 when she famously wagged her finger at Obama during a face-to-face encounter on an airport runway when he visited Arizona. In her bid for reelection that year, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association even though her primary opponent sat on the organization's board of directors. The NRA gave Brewer an A+ rating and under her leadership, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. In addition, people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed. Inside Politics: Is Brewer part of a GOP evolution? However, her conservative credentials took a hit in 2013 when she decided Arizona would participate in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. A moderate side . Some other conservative governors chose for their states to opt out instead of accepting federal money to pay for the expansion, but Brewer called it a ""moral"" obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured. In February, Brewer vetoed a controversial state bill that would have allowed business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. If she had accepted the measure, Arizona could have faced litigation and a boycott, potentially harming Arizona's economy and tourism industry as well as the 2015 Super Bowl to be played there. Protesters celebrate Ariz. governor's veto . Brewer cited the business community's opposition to the bill in announcing her veto. Arizona law dictates that a governor can't run for more than two consecutive terms, and her time in office before she was elected in 2010 would count as a full four-year term. Differing opinions exist on whether Brewer could be eligible, but she made clear Wednesday she would step down, vowing to ""work until my final hours completing the people's business."" ""Both my pen and my veto stamp have plenty of ink,"" she said. CNN's Leigh Ann Caldwell, Dana Bash, Miguel Marquez and Quand Thomas contributed to this report.","Jan Brewer, who took on President Obama over homeland security, will not seek reelection .

"(CNN) -- NATO has launched around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence in the war-torn country, America's ambassador to the organization told reporters Monday. Representatives of key Western powers also highlighted the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone in Libya -- part of growing campaign to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi's grip on power. British, French and U.S. officials were working on a draft text that includes language on a no-fly zone, diplomatic sources at the United Nations told CNN. The language in the text will deal with triggers rather than timelines for taking such a step, one diplomat noted. If gross violations of human rights are committed, the diplomat added, the elements of the text could be quickly turned into a resolution. Any resolution on military intervention in Libya, however, would be subject to a vote by the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council. Such intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China, who rarely approve of such measures. ""The violence that's been taking place and perpetrated by the government in Libya is unacceptable,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said at the White House. Moammar Gadhafi's government ""will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there."" Obama stressed that NATO is considering a wide range of responses -- including military options -- for dealing with the crisis. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later cited three potential responses under active consideration: establishing the no-fly zone, military-backed humanitarian aid, and stronger enforcement of the U.N. arms embargo. Carney downplayed speculation about the possibility of providing arms to the Libyan rebels, telling reporters that ""it would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya."" ""We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we're pursuing,"" he warned. A senior U.S. official familiar with the administration's deliberations on Libya denied a report in the British press that the administration had asked Saudi Arabia to arm the rebels. U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague told members of the British parliament, however, that ""we are making contingency plans for all eventualities in Libya."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in Belgium that the organization has no immediate intention to intervene in the Libyan civil war. But ""as a defense alliance and a security organization, it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality,"" he said. Rasmussen stressed that it is important to ""remain vigilant"" in light of ""systemic attacks"" by Gadhafi's regime against the Libyan population. ""The violation of human rights and international humanitarian law is outrageous,"" he said. Rasmussen also noted that the defense ministers from member states will meet Friday and Saturday to discuss how the organization can help partner countries in North Africa and the broader Middle East. ""We can see a strong wind of change blowing across the region -- and it is blowing in the direction of freedom and democracy,"" he asserted. Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa lashed out the Western leaders, calling their response part of ""a conspiracy to divide (and) partition the country."" ""The English are yearning for the colonial era"" while Obama is acting ""like a child,"" he said. ""Territorial integrity is sacrosanct and we will die for it."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, meanwhile, appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli, the United Nations said in a statement Monday. Abdelilah Al-Khatib, a former foreign minister of Jordan, will ""undertake urgent consultations with the authorities in Tripoli and in the region on the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the wider dimensions of the crisis,"" according to the statement. As diplomats debated various options, the violence in Libya continued to intensify. Forces loyal to Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf, launching aerial strikes meant to help crush the uprising against him. Death toll estimates from the conflict have reached as high as 2,000 people. Roughly 200,000 people have fled Libya, with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, according to the United Nations.

"(CNN) -- Spanish champions Barcelona began 2011 with an 11th successive league victory on Sunday night to move five points clear of title rivals Real Madrid. Young winger Pedro Gonzalez, standing in for the absent Lionel Messi, scored both goals in the 2-1 victory over Levante while World Cup winner Xavi equaled the Catalan club's all-time appearance record of 549 matches. After a scoreless first half in which Barcelona struggled to break down the Valencia side's defense, Gonzalez broke the deadlock two minutes into the second period as he did well to make space inside the penalty and fire in a deflected low shot from Daniel Alves' agonizingly delayed pass. With Messi allowed to take an extended winter holiday, the 23-year-old continued to make the most of his starting chance by adding his eight league goal this season in the 59th minute after Brazilian right-back Alves delivered a better-judged low cross into his path. Messi to miss Barcelona's 2011 opener . Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola was also without the services of injured captain Carles Puyol and the suspended Gerard Pique, and his depleted defense had to withstand a determined Levante fightback after Stuani's superb left-foot volley reduced the deficit with 10 minutes to go. The 30-year-old Xavi, who made an all-Barcelona three-man shortlist for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award to be named this month, matched the milestone set by defender Migueli 20 years ago. ""It is an honor for Xavi, a home-bred player, to have worn the Barca shirt so many times,"" club president Sandro Rosell said. ""Xavi has won everything and he represents the Barca values: effort, loyalty, work and heart. Loyalty is a difficult value to find, and what Xavi has done for Barca is extraordinary."" Levante, who have not beaten Barcelona in six visits to the Camp Nou, remained just two points above the relegation despite a marked improvement on the team's last outing of 2010 -- an 8-0 drubbing by Real Madrid in the first leg of their last-16 Spanish Cup tie. Spanish league strike called off . Second-placed Real will be boosted by the long-awaited return of Brazilian midfielder Kaka for Monday night's derby with city rivals Getafe. Kaka, the second-most expensive signing in the Real squad behind Cristiano Ronaldo, has been sidelined since requiring knee surgery in early August before the start of this season. ""Kaka won't start, he can't yet. He can give us 15 or 20 minutes of his very great quality, but no more,"" coach Jose Mourinho told reporters on Sunday. In the day's other 17th-round matches, Valencia consolidated fourth place with a controversial 2-1 win over fellow Champions League hopefuls Espanyol, despite having striker Aritz Aduriz sent off in the 61st minute for hitting Francisco Chica with a flailing arm. Aduriz scored his seventh league goal this season and his 11th overall to put the home side ahead in the 29th minute, but fifth-placed Espanyol leveled when Portuguese defender Ricardo Costa inexplicably stooped to head Jose Callejon's innocuous cross into his own net in first-half injury time. Espanyol could not take advantage of their numerical advantage, and Juan Mata nodded the winner in the second minute of time added on despite being in an offside position when Costa headed the ball across the goal. Sevilla seek to revive their own European qualification bid with a 1-0 victory at home to Osasuna that lifted the club into ninth place -- 23 points behind Barcelona. Striker Fredi Kanoute scored the only goal in the 36th minute as he raced to the near post to head in a freekick from Jesus Navas. The defeat left Osasuna in 15th place, four points above the bottom three. Deportivo La Coruna moved up to 11th place with a 2-1 victory at nine-man Athletic Bilbao, who stayed eighth. Forward Adrian Alvarez scored in each half for the visitors, the first from the penalty spot on 22 minutes and the second seven minutes after the break. Both teams were reduced to 10 men by the end of the first period, with Bilbao defender Mikel San Jose receiving a straight red card on 35 and Deportivo midfielder Juan Rodriguez also sent off for a second booking just before the interval. Striker Fernando Llorente reduced the deficit with four minutes to play with his 11th La Liga strike, but his teammate Ustaritz Aldekoaotalora was also marched for a second yellow card at the end. Malaga moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 win at second-bottom Sporting Gijon, coming from behind with goals from defender Weligton and midfielder Apono, who netted a 59th-minute penalty.","Spain midfielder Xavi matches Barcelona's all-time appearance record of 549 games .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese table tennis player Zhuang Zedong, a key figure in what became known as the ""ping pong diplomacy"" that helped thaw frosty Cold War relations between the United States and China, has died aged 73, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Zhuang's chance meeting with a U.S. player was instrumental in Beijing's decision to invite the American table tennis team for an exhibition match in 1971. That match laid the groundwork for the visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972 and ultimately paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1979, ending China's isolation from the outside world. Xinhua said that Zhuang, who was considered one of the best players in the world in the 1960s, had met U.S. table tennis player Glenn Cowan at a tournament in Japan. Cowan, a long-haired teenager, had jumped on the Chinese team's bus after missing his own and Zhuang struck up a conversation through a translator -- a brave act given the constraints of China's Cultural Revolution-era politics. ""We were all tense,"" Zhuang told CNN in 2008. ""Our team had been advised not to speak to Americans, not to shake their hands, and not to exchange gifts with them. ""I looked at him, thinking, 'he is not the one who makes national policies, he is just an athlete, an ordinary American',"" he recalled. Zhuang gave the hippie-looking American a silk brocade as a gift. The next day, Cowan gave him a T-shirt emblazoned with a peace sign and the words ""LET IT BE."" Pictures of their encounter spread around the world, and, under the orders of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, the U.S. team was invited to visit China. During their visit, the U.S. announced the end of a 20-year trade embargo against the People's Republic. Their journey turned out to be the first public move in a rapprochement between the two bitter enemies. Zhuang said he never thought his simple gesture of friendship would coin the phrase ""ping-pong diplomacy."" ""I had no idea what was going on,"" he said. ""I didn't know what Chairman Mao was thinking. I was merely a ping-pong player."" Zhuang won three world championships and was a hero in table-tennis mad China. An innovative ""pen-hold"" style propelled him to the top of his sport. He became China's sports minister but fell victim to the power struggles that followed Mao's death in 1976 and was detained for four years before being exiled to the provinces. Zhuang later returned to Beijing, where he coached table tennis to teenagers. According to Xinhua, Zhuang had been suffering from colon cancer since 2008 and died in a Beijing hospital on Sunday after developing liver and lung complications.

"(CNN) -- It is now more than 20 years since pro-democracy grassroots organizations led struggles that eventually resulted in the overthrow of long-serving authoritarian regimes in many countries in Africa. Since the 1990s, there have been significant improvements in the transition to democratic governance in Africa. However, there have also been some major reversals. Click on the interactive map above to find out more about Africa's governments. Unfortunately, some pre-1990 incumbent leaders (for example, Paul Biya of Cameroon and Robert Gabriel Mugabe of Zimbabwe) remain in power, despite efforts by the opposition to unseat them. In addition, Mali, which had made significant progress toward deepening and institutionalizing democracy, suffered major regression, first, by the capture and subsequent occupation of the northern part of the country by a group of separatist rebels, and second, by a military coup that ousted its democratically elected government. Soldiers also intervened in Guinea-Bissau, suspended government institutions and proceeded to engage in activities that seriously undermined the rule of law. Meanwhile, violent mobilization by ethnic and religious groups continue to negatively impact governance in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Kenya, Uganda, and Madagascar. The failure of national institutions to grant adequate protection to individual liberties continues to plague countries such as The Gambia, where a U.N report says several prison inmates were executed last year without due process of law, and South Africa where the police last year used deadly force against miners who were exercising their rights to strike. See also: New violence clouds future for South African mines . Despite these setbacks, there have been significant and spectacular achievements in the continent's struggle to deepen and institutionalize democracy. Ghana continues to lead the way. First, after the country's president, John Atta Mills, died in office in July 2012, he was succeeded, as required by the constitution, by the country's vice president, John Dramani Mahama. Second, in December 2012, the country held competitive, fair and peaceful elections, which were won by Mahama. He was subsequently sworn in as the country's president. Finally, Ghana has also shown significant leadership in openness and transparency in government. In 2003, Ghana committed to the extractive industries transparency initiative and has since emerged as a leading example of how governments can minimize corruption in the management of public revenues from the extractive sector. Read also: What Ghana can teach the rest of Africa about democracy . Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Guinea and Malawi have made some gains as they move steadily towards democratic governance. Ivory Coast, after a violent and extremely bloody civil war, inaugurated a new president, followed by the development of new laws and institutions, especially those dealing with corruption and openness and transparency in government. In addition, the country now has a fully functioning legislative assembly, and the country's security situation, previously worsened by sectarian strife, has improved significantly. Sierra Leone, whose institutions were destroyed by a long and brutal civil war, has seen restoration of many national institutions and a return to the rule of law. This is exemplified by the fact that the country's 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections were free, fair and peaceful and the results were accepted by the people. The winners went on to form a government which continues to rule the country in peace. Senegal also held elections in 2012, which resulted in the peaceful transfer of power. Since taking office, the new president, Macky Sall, has made significant efforts to improve openness and transparency in government, as well as force public officials to be accountable to the constitution and the people. Lesotho's governance system was strengthened by successfully conducting fair and free elections, which resulted in the peaceful transfer of power. Both Malawi and Guinea saw some improvements in their governance systems -- in Guinea, opportunities for civic dialogue improved significantly and in Malawi, the death of the sitting president was not followed by bloody chaos; instead, as required by the constitution, the vice president, Joyce Banda, was inaugurated the new president. The Arab Spring brought significant improvements to governance structures in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. The tragic death of Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi, by self-immolation, brought about a grassroots political movement among Tunisians that effectively overthrew the country's authoritarian ruler, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. This movement, which was subsequently nicknamed the Arab Spring, spread to Egypt and Libya, resulting in the ouster of long-serving dictatorships in those countries as well. Elections, considered fair and free, have since been held in all three countries and each now has a democratically elected government. Nevertheless, many groups within these countries, especially those which historically have suffered exploitation and persecution at the hands of their governments (e.g., ethnic and religious minorities, and women) have expressed the fear that although these new regimes came to power through democratic elections, they are likely to reject or abandon democracy once they have had a chance to consolidate their power bases. Already, such fears appear to be coming true in Egypt, where the new president, Mohamed Morsy, has already engaged in extra-constitutional practices to grab more power for himself. In addition, the elected parliament was dissolved by the anachronistic supreme constitutional court, and the new constitution was hurriedly drafted and done so through a top-down, elite-driven, non-participatory process. As a consequence, what had started as a dynamic grassroots-led program to transform Egypt's laws and institutions and produce a more effective and relevant governance architecture, has degenerated into a struggle by entrenched interests, led by Morsy and his Freedom and Justice party, to further entrench themselves politically and economically. In Tunisia, the revolution, which since the ouster of Ben Ali had been progressing well, despite opposition from several Islamist groups, suffered significant regression following the brutal and cowardly assassination of Chokri Belaid, a secularist and staunch critic of the ruling Islamist-led government of Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali. Meanwhile, the brutal assassination of the U.S. ambassador and the wanton destruction of property in Benghazi, the cradle of the Libyan revolution, is indicative of a still-born transformation, one that had failed to create institutions capable of guaranteeing the rule of law in Libya. The struggles of grassroots organizations in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt are symptomatic of what needs to be done throughout Africa to deepen and institutionalize democracy. Read also: Western-style democracy 'not suitable for Africa'? The many individuals that participated in North Africa's grassroots revolution to replace authoritarianism with democracy are frustrated because their revolutions did not achieve their critical goals -- reconstruction and reconstitution of anachronistic and dysfunctional state systems inherited from the ancien rÃ©gimes to provide legal and judicial systems that guarantee the just rule of law. That is, laws and institutions that protect individuals' rights, including protecting all citizens from violence directed at them either by state or non-state actors, and enhance people's ability to engage in productive activities to create the wealth that they need to fight poverty and improve their living conditions. Such laws are consistent with the provisions of the universal declaration of human rights and other international human rights instruments. These revolutions, as has been the case in other African countries, were hijacked by entrenched opportunists, whose main interest is in preserving the status quo, so that they can continue to use these anachronistic state structures to enrich themselves at the expense of their fellow citizens. In order to advance the transition to democratic governance in Africa, as well as minimize the chances of regression, each African country must engage all its relevant stakeholder groups in state reconstruction through democratic (i.e., bottom-up, participatory, inclusive and people-driven) constitution making to produce institutional arrangements that adequately constrain civil servants and political elites, enhance the ability of each country's diverse population groups to coexist peacefully, and create economic and political environments that maximize entrepreneurial activities and the creation of wealth.

"(CNN) -- One more time, Whitney Houston brought a crowd to its feet. ""I Will Always Love You"" had earned record of the year at the 1994 Grammy festivities, with the accompanying ""The Bodyguard"" soundtrack taking home best album. But for all the awards that Houston earned that night, it was her voice that resonated most -- as it did throughout her career. The iconic songstress' range and power were on display once again Sunday night, echoing through the packed Staples Center moments after the music world's luminaries bowed their heads in prayer in honor of her death. By the time a replay of her 1994 performance was complete, the audience's applause gave way to an emotional standing ovation. A day earlier, Houston was pronounced dead in her fourth floor room at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel. The world may wait as many as eight weeks -- when results from toxicology and other tests should be in -- to learn what happened, with Assistant Chief Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office saying little Sunday besides ""foul play is not suspected."" Headlines in recent years about Houston have tended to focus more on her battles with drug addiction and her relationship with her ex-husband, ""New Edition"" performer Bobby Brown, than her musical accomplishments. Yet recollections of her enormous talent took center stage Sunday night in Los Angeles, as did the six-time Grammy winner's membership in the music world's ""family."" LL Cool J, host of the 54th annual Grammy Awards, spoke right away to Houston's personal and professional legacy, soon after taking the stage following an opening performance by Bruce Springsteen. ""Tonight, we ask ourselves: How do we speak to this time? To this day? There is no way around this. We've had a death in our family,"" he said. The rapper and actor then offered his prayer, thanking God ""for sharing our sister Whitney with us."" ""And although she's gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit and to have her lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever,"" he said. During the show, stars of past and present -- from Bruno Mars to Stevie Wonder -- celebrated the late singer. The sentiments voiced Sunday night echoed those that have been offered ever since news broke of Houston's death from close friends, musical icons and everyday fans who never met the iconic performer but were moved by her music. Then, after a memorial honoring other stars from Amy Winehouse to Clarence Clemons who also died this past year -- and nearly three hours after LL Cool J promised the Grammys ""will remember you the best way we know how: with a song"" -- Jennifer Hudson appeared under a bright, solitary spotlight. Wearing a black sleeveless dress and anchored firmly in the middle of the stage, the Oscar and two-time Grammy winner offered her own rendition of ""I Will Always Love You."" Twice during the song, the crowd burst into applause. Hudson offered one small embellishment, changing a lyric to sing: ""Whitney, we will always love you.""","NEW: Jennifer Hudson sings ""I Will Always Love You"" in a Grammy tribute .

"Manila (CNN) -- The right punch Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez threw to knock out Filipino Manny Pacquiao in the sixth round of their non-title welterweight clash arguably registered on the Richter scale, with the aftershocks being felt from the posh MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada to the last-standing shanty in the typhoon-ravaged areas of Mindanao, the Philippines. When Pacquiao hit the canvas with a resounding thud, Filipinos all over the world cringed and felt the impact of the debacle down to their toenails. In the Philippines, where the fight was shown in cinemas, restaurants, and makeshift arenas, some stood in silence in utter disbelief while others unabashedly shed tears. The day following the fight, the front page of all the major newspapers in the country read like the obituary page. Pacquiao's loss could not have come at a worse time. Just days before the fight, Super Typhoon ""Pablo"" (international name Bopha) leveled several provinces in the Visayas and Mindanao. Downtrodden Filipinos were all counting on Pacquiao to lift their faltering spirit with another sterling performance in the ring, but the Pacman also ended up taking it flush on the chin. That Filipinos are also treating Pacquiao's loss as a ""natural disaster"" is not without a reason. Pacquiao is more than a boxer in the eyes of his countrymen. From the time he burst into the world boxing stage by knocking out Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera in November 2003, Pacquiao has been looked upon as a walking icon, a symbol of everything that is positive about the Filipino: God-fearing, resilient and tough as nails. After every major win in the ring, Pacquiao, who grew up in dirt poverty, made it a point to share his astronomical paycheck among the poor. Down the road, he explored other avenues to help out: he successfully ran for a seat in Congress and started moonlighting as a game show host who indiscriminately gave out prizes to contestants. The devastating loss to Marquez, however, sends the signal that Pacquiao is already feeling the brunt of the responsibility he has been made to assume. Before the fight, not a few noted that Pacquiao's focus on boxing had waned. He insisted that he was in control of the situation, but the observations were confirmed following the horrific knockout loss to Marquez. To some extent, Pacquiao has become a prisoner of the suffocating image he has created. Turning 34 on December 17, Pacquiao's career as a boxer is at the crossroads. Is it time to focus solely on boxing to give his career the glorious send-off it deserves? Is walking away from the sport with his health intact the best option available? Or should he again flirt with disaster by continuing to multi-task? Considering all that he has done for his countrymen, perhaps it is only proper for Pacquiao to finally look out for himself. Boxing is a dangerous sport and what happened in the Marquez fight is proof that even a supposedly invincible boxing champion is susceptible to a flesh wound. Then again, at a time when his countrymen are down on their knees and in dire need of a hero, it appears that Pacquiao is bent on lacing on the gloves to carry the fight anew for his people. There is this scene in the movie The Dark Knight Rises where Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, tries to convince Batman to leave Gotham City. ""You don't owe these people anymore. You've given them everything,"" Kyle tells Batman, to which the Dark Knight replies: ""Not everything. Not yet."" You can say that the Philippines' own knight is treading the same dangerous curve. We can only hope that he will emerge from his quest in one piece as nobody wants a repeat of the Marquez ordeal.","Tolentino: Pacquiao's knockout traumatized Filipinos around the world .

"(CNN) -- Sevilla moved into sixth in La Liga after beating ten-man Valencia 2-0 at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in Spain. Goals from Alvaro Negredo and Alejandro Alfaro sealed victory for the hosts -- a task that was made much easier when Valencia midfielder Mehmet Topal was shown a straight red card. Sevilla's fifth win of the season took them above Real Sociedad and into the European places on 17 points, nine behind leaders Real Madrid. Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano wasted two good early openings for the home side while at the other end Juan Manuel Mata forced Javi Varas into a smart save. But the game turned on 25 minutes when Mehmet Topal flew into a challenge on Martín Cáceres and got his marching orders. The ten men of Valencia held on until halftime despite almost constant Sevilla pressure, but the deadlock was finally broken on 54 minutes. Negredo found the bottom corner of the net with a left footed shot from a tight angle after a quick counter attack. Minutes after that Fabiano hit the bar before Negredo headed wide from inside the area. But it was 2-0 on 77 minutes when Alfaro headed home Mouhamadou Dabo's cross from close range. There was still time for Diego Capel to hit the post with a fierce shot in stoppage time as Sevilla completed a comfortable win.","Sevilla beat Valencia 2-0 to go sixth in the Spanish Liga .

"(CNN) -- First, Michelle Knight heard pounding on the door. Then, there was silence. A year later, she still remembers the dread she felt that day. Rescuers were banging on the door after learning Knight and fellow captive Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus were trapped inside. But Knight and DeJesus didn't know the police were coming. ""For me it was the most awesome day ever. But it was also terrifying at the same time, because me and Gina actually thought someone was breaking in,"" Knight told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Wednesday. ""We laugh about it now."" But at the time, it was anything but funny. The two women huddled in their boarded-up bedroom, afraid burglars were coming for them, Knight said. That terror turned to relief, Knight said, when she caught a glimpse of a police badge and heard a police radio. It wasn't long before she jumped into the police officer's arms. ""I ran right into her arms,"" Knight recalled, ""and I literally choked her. ... (and) I said, 'Please don't let me go. Please don't put me down.'"" At 32 years old, Knight walked out the front door of 2207 Seymour Avenue for the very first and last time. Knight recalls being Castro's 'punching bag' Confrontation in court . For 11 years, Knight was brutally raped and tortured in Ariel Castro's ""house of horrors."" Rescuers freed her, along with fellow captives DeJesus and Amanda Berry, a year ago from the Cleveland home, drawing national attention to the horrific case. Knight was rushed to a hospital, where she was treated for a long list of health issues due to the years of beatings and neglect. Although she was free, she was also alone. With no family to speak of, friends or home to go to, she took refuge at an assisted living facility outside Cleveland, where she prepared to face her captor in court. ""After 11 years, I am finally being heard, and it's liberating,"" she said in a powerful statement at Castro's sentencing describing the abuse she endured. ""You took 11 years of my life away, and I have got it back. I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning,"" she told Castro. Knight told CNN she was determined to speak out. ""It was important to me to express how I felt about what he did and how he did it and let the judge know that he needed to be punished,"" she said. How Castro lured her to the house . Hope for the future . One year later, Knight is in a very different place. While Berry and DeJesus have largely stayed out of the public eye, Knight has done the opposite -- appearing at public events and writing a book, ""Finding Me,"" in hopes that her experiences will help people know they can survive anything. Castro, the daily devil in these three women's lives for so long, is now out of the picture. He killed himself in prison last September, just a month into serving his prison sentence of life plus 1,000 years. ""I understand why he did it,"" Knight said. ""He couldn't face what he did with his head held high. He had to face it like a coward, 'cause he was ashamed and embarrassed of what he done. And he didn't want what he did to us to happen to him."" Now, armed with friends and a good support system, Knight said she's giving a voice to other people who are missing, like she once was. ""I was considered a forgotten one,"" she said. ""That's a reason why I made a poem and said that all the people that are out there, they're not forgotten in my eyes. Never."" And she's focused on starting over. The past year, she said, has been ""overwhelming but amazing as hell."" She has changed her name to Lily, after her favorite flower. She's back in school with the hope of opening her own restaurant. And she's planning to get a new tattoo with a message of survival: ""God gave us this chosen life because He knew we could handle it.""

"(CNN) -- Switzerland's largest city has permitted the use of controversial posters which call for a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques in the European country. The Federal Commission against Racism said the posters defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population. The posters are part of a campaign by the nationalist Swiss People's Party (SVP) and feature a veiled woman against a background of a Swiss flag pierced by several minarets resembling missiles. The cities of Basel and Lausanne have described the posters as racist and banned them in publicly-owned spaces. However, Zurich is among a clutch of cities that have chosen not to prohibit them. According to the SVP, the minarets symbolize ideological opposition to the country's constitution. Switzerland will hold a national referendum on the issue on November 29. According to Agence France-Presse, an opinion poll by the daily Tages-Anzeiger showed more than 51 percent of Swiss voters are against any ban on minaret construction. The Swiss government and all the other major political parties are recommending a ""no"" vote, while local Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders have joined forces to reject a ban, AFP added. The mayor of Zurich, Corine Mauch, told CNN that the decision on the poster was taken on the basis of political freedom of speech in the run-up to November's vote. ""While we disapprove of the posters we took the decision after legal consultations. ""We consulted the Federal Commission against Racism and spoke to Muslim communities in the city, but decided banning the posters from public spaces would draw more attention to the issue."" Do you agree with the Zurich decision? However, the Federal Commission against Racism said in a statement Wednesday that the posters ""defame Switzerland's peaceful Muslim population, feed prejudice, and portray the Muslim community as wanting to dominate Switzerland, oppress women and trample on fundamental rights."" The SVP have courted controversy with their campaigns in the past. In 2007 they faced international criticism for leading an anti-immigration campaign during the federal election that featured a poster with a white sheep kicking a black sheep off a Swiss flag. Under party leader Christoph Blocher they went on to win the biggest share of the vote in the 200-member parliament, taking 55 seats. Earlier this year they issued a poster depicting crows pecking at a map of Switzerland, as the country prepared to vote on whether to support an extension of a free movement of labor deal with the European Union which would include new members, Bulgaria and Romania.","Posters call for a ban on the construction of minarets on mosques .

"New York (CNN) -- For guests at a landmark hotel in the Big Apple, ordering breakfast in bed that gets wheeled in on a silver platter will soon be a thing of the past. New York Hilton Midtown, the biggest hotel in New York City, with nearly 2,000 rooms, says it will eliminate room service starting this summer. ""Like most full-service hotels, New York Hilton Midtown has continued to see a decline in traditional room service requests over the last several years as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve,"" a New York Hilton Midtown representative said. The move will cut 55 jobs. Room service: A thing of the past? In the place of room service the hotel is trying a new concept: a cafeteria-style restaurant called Herb n' Kitchen. The self-service model offers options such as flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, and gourmet coffee. The staffing needs of the new concept are still being evaluated, the hotel said. This isn't the first Hilton property to get rid of room service: Hilton Hawaiian Village stopped offering it in the fall, replacing it with a less formal takeout and delivery option. Mark Woodworth, president of the hotel consulting firm PKF Hospitality Research, said this type of change is in line with what has been evolving for quite some time in the lodging industry. ""More and more consumers prefer to 'help themselves' to what they need, and the increased use of automated check-in/check-out kiosks and complementary buffets are common examples of this,"" Woodworth said. ""If management is providing a service that, at best, is only marginally valued by the guest, then there is a strong motivation to end such a practice."" In 2012, room service revenue represented 1.2% of total hotel revenue, down from 1.3% the year before, according to an industry survey by PKF Hospitality Research. Travel + Leisure News Editor Amy Farley says Hilton's game-changing move could set a precedent for other hotels. The best hotel room service . ""Expectations for travelers evolve,"" she said. ""Two decades ago it would have been unheard of for a major airline to not serve food, and now we're used to taking our credit cards or bringing food with us. ""Travelers are evolving to the point where they understand hotels to be full service even if they don't offer room service."" Some hotels are offering a new approach to room service altogether. In February, The Hudson Hotel in midtown Manhattan introduced the Hudson Common Express, a burger joint that offers the option of take-out or delivery of items like French toast, grilled cheese, egg and maple braised bacon sandwiches and kale Ceasar salad. The Grand Hyatt in New York's Times Square scaled back its room service hours and has a gourmet 24-hour market as an alternative. The Public Chicago hotel's Public Express offers gourmet meals designed by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, of New York's Jean-Georges restaurant, delivered in a brown bag at ""lightning quick speed"" to guests' rooms any time day or night. ""This casualization of fine dining is partly due to the economy but it's also a way that we're evolving,"" Farley said. ""We know that we can have an excellent meal at a farmhouse table and this extends to hotels. They'll rethink the white tablecloth and will instead offer room service in a box with no fancy silverware."" New York Hilton Midtown said the Hilton chain has no current plans to roll out the initiative more broadly.","The New York Hilton Midtown cuts room delivery .

"(CNN) -- Airline passengers are already able to check in to flights, download boarding passes, select a seat on the go and keep an eye on the upgrades list thanks to recent evolutions in smartphone technology, and the options just keep growing. A global industrywide Airline IT Trends Survey shows that more than 90% of the airlines surveyed are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities to ease the hassles of getting through the airport and improve the in-flight experience. And the airlines are likely to find a way to generate revenue, too. So what's a flier to expect from airline apps on the horizon? In the not-too-distant future, you'll probably be able to rent a car, pay bag fees and use augmented reality to find the nearest airport bar through your airline's smartphone app. Delta Air Lines is putting emphasis on improving mobile functionality. While some airline apps allow travelers to make flight reservations (a feature that Delta has not introduced but promises is coming), the world's largest carrier is one of the few airlines that gives customers the ability to adjust travel itineraries from their mobile device. Delayed Delta passengers who miss a connection now can immediately rebook a different flight and download a new boarding pass, all while in the air. The airline has some new app plans up its sleeve as well. Delta declines to give a release date for the feature, but it is close to unveiling a new tool where travelers can track checked baggage from their mobile devices, according to Delta spokesman Paul Skrbec. (They can already do so on the airline's website.) The airline eventually could offer other services on its mobile app that are already listed on its website, such as the ability to search for hotel and car rental reservations, Skrbec said. GuestLogix, a company that creates onboard merchandising technology, is already trying to integrate these services into an airline app with the launch of its OnTouch Mobile Concierge platform, which it pitched to major airlines this week, a company official said. The mobile app does not just offer access to itinerary details, but it also functions as a one-stop shop for airline passengers to make in-air purchases related to their trip, such as in-flight refreshments and arrangements for ground transportation, dining and entertainment in the destination city. GuestLogix says it is in talks with most major North American carriers about implementing the OnTouch Mobile Concierge, which would likely be offered by airlines as a separate app from the ticketing-based ones that exist. ""We are providing airlines with the opportunity to offer their passengers a streamlined experience,"" said Brett Proud, GuestLogix's executive vice president of new markets and products. ""Disparity within the mobile channel is a huge issue despite the fact that consumers are increasingly expecting cross-platform integration and a consistent experience. The fully integrated mobile platform that we have built allows travelers to check in to flights and hotels, view travel information and updates, and receive offers from multiple airline carriers, hotels and other services -- all at one time, and in one place."" The hope is the OnTouch Mobile Concierge will also allow airlines to generate new revenue streams by capitalizing for the first time on destination-related purchases. But integrating outside products and services into airline apps is not the only way that airlines hope to customize the passenger experience while increasing revenue. According to Delta's Skrbec, the demand is likely there for airlines eventually to offer add-ons such as standby upgrades and the ability to pay for extra checked baggage through mobile applications, but industry research suggests that offering those types of mobile transactions won't happen overnight. According to a report released this year by Amadeus, a company that develops technology for the travel industry, ancillary services -- from premium seating to in-flight meals -- are unlikely to be sold on airlines' mobile platforms on a widespread level for another year or two. So more add-ons and products will be available, but is help on the way for slogging through the airport? American, United and Continental airlines currently offer airport maps in their mobile apps, with Delta soon to join them. But the maps are generally useful only in locating gates; they don't offer detailed information on where to find food and shopping locations. Augmented reality technology may come to the rescue here. It allows users to point the camera on their smartphone at their surroundings and receive corresponding information about their current location, such as which restaurants and stores are nearby. Amadeus's report estimates it will take three to five years for most airlines to find a way to integrate augmented reality into an airline app. Airlines might take some cues from a new app released by Denmark's Copenhagen Airport this year, which became the world's first application to use augmented reality indoors successfully -- according to SITA, the app's developer. The app allows travelers at the airport to access not just gate information but also details on surrounding shops and services, saving them time while trying to catch a flight. Even when it comes to selling fares through mobile clients, a service that 85% of airlines in the Airline IT Trends Survey either offer or plan to offer by 2014, there is room for improvement. Currently, airline apps only offer tickets with their specific carrier, and mobile customers can't take advantage of the flexibility offered by airline alliances. ""Airline alliances, the Star Alliance in particular, haven't really kept pace with mobile developments,"" said Dennis Schaal, the North America editor of the travel tech site Tnooz.com. ""Granted, creating a mobile app that brings in dozens of airlines would be no easy task, but there should be some kind of booking capability at this juncture."" The Star Alliance has two mobile apps available for download: one that offers airport information in addition to the ability to search and track flights, and another that is a fare finder for flights on the alliance's airlines. The Star Alliance includes airlines such as United, Continental, Air Canada and US Airways -- which does not currently offer a mobile app. But those airlines that fail to take the full leap into the mobile world will quickly find themselves in the minority. Apps might not replace websites as the primary place where people purchase airline reservations, especially with new airline initiatives to integrate ticket-purchasing apps into social-media sites such as Facebook. However, they're beginning to offer a level of customer service and convenience that has never before been possible in the industry, and perhaps could even transform the experience of traveling enough to create a new barometer on which airline brands will be judged in the future.","Airlines are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities .

"Eight staffers at Cory Booker's tech start-up have started looking for new jobs as the company is expected to shutter. The video aggregation company is said to be losing cash quickly and it is supposedly being kept alive through early November so that it's closure doesn't hurt Booker's chances at winning the New Jersey Senate race. The latest news about the floundering company, called Waywire, comes days after it was revealed that the 15-year-old son of CNN president Jeff Zucker had a position on the company's advisory board and had stock options in the company. The teenager resigned just hours later, and it now is clear that he is not the first person to leave the company. Public face: Cory Booker (pictured Thursday), the current mayor of Newark, New Jersey who is now running for Senate, is the founder of a video aggregation start up and he stands to make $1million to $5million out of the company . Keeping up appearances: Insiders believe that the company is going to remain open just until after the November election so that its closure doesn't hurt Booker's chances at winning the New Jersey Senate seat . It was known that the small company had a round of layoffs in the spring, but now The New York Post reported that eight peole left in April. 'When the company moved its focus from original production to curation, the production team was impacted. Several were given the option of changed, curation-focused roles with the company; they declined,' a spokeswoman told The Post. It isn't just staffers who are looking for work elsewhere, but also one of the three founding partners, Nathan Richardson. The company spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Richardson, who serves as CEO, is looking to be appointed on the board of a different, unidentified company. 'That engagement would not impact his ability to meet his Waywire commitments,' she said. Booker did his best on Thursday following a debate to calm the fires without actually revealing any more details/ . Her idea: Sarah Ross is said to be the one who approached Jeff Zucker's son Andrew (seen with his father at left in 2009) to be a member of the advisory board of Cory Booker's start-up Waywire. He has since resigned . Connected: Sarah Ross, seen here talking with Booker and trailed by Mark Zuckerberg, is well known in Silicon Valley . 'This company is in its infancy. Of . course it has changed its business model. It’s going through changes,' he said of the internal overhaul at Waywire. 'I’m a part of an ownership group and we’ve concluded not to discuss that.' The . other parts of the ownership group are Mr Richardson and Sarah Ross, . the tech entrepreneur who admitted to being the one to suggest Zucker . join the board because the teenager is apparently known for his insight . into popular trends among teens. Ms . Ross then had a conversation with both Jeff and Andrew Zucker and they . agreed to have the now-15-year-old sign on to Waywire's advisory board . and receive a 'de minimus' amount of stock options in return. An . unidentified source told CNN Money that Booker himself was 'not . involved at all' with the decision, and Ms Ross herself admitted at an . early stage that the politician would not be a part of the day-to-day . operations of the start up. Promoting the brand: If  Booker wins, he will have to resign from the board of Waywire and stop promoting it from his well-followed Twitter feed . The . New York Times reported that even in the nascent phase, it was clear . among the founders that Booker would be a more public role. When . the launched the company, Ms Ross reportedly said to Booker: 'You know . what? You should do it, found the company. Obviously you don’t have to . be involved — you’ve got a full-time job. But found the company.’ Unlike . many of the other boldface names connected to Waywire, like Oprah . Winfrey and Google's Eric Schmidt, it does not seem as if the elder . Zucker actually has any financial stake in the company. Very little has previously been revealed about the start-up, which was officially created in May 2012. Booker . reportedly came up with the idea for the company, whose mission is to . effectively become a different iteration of YouTube where the work of . up-and-coming students is highlighted, while meeting with Ms Ross and Mr . Richardson. He said it was . easy to raise the $1.75million worth of seed money for the venture . 'because of the power of the idea'. He said nothing of his rising power . on the national political stage. For . Booker's part, he may not be able to be involved in the company much . longer.

"(CNN) -- When Tahani Hamdan booked her trip to the Middle East, the 25-year-old was excited to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan with her family for the first time. Born and raised in Houston, Hamdan normally feels safe making the trip to the Middle East. But the recent violence has made the Palestinian-American fearful for her safety, even though she's visited several times. ""I feel like I'm putting my life in jeopardy by going,"" she said. Hamdan left Houston on July 19, and after two days of flight delays, she arrived in Jordan and drove into the West Bank, where she's staying. She said she wishes she could have postponed her trip, but she doesn't know when she'll see her family again. ""I have multiple sclerosis as well as rheumatoid arthritis, so I don't know if I'll be physically able to visit again if I don't go this summer,"" Hamdan said. The violent conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants has intensified this month after the June killings of three Israeli teenagers and a Palestinian teen. The conflict has made for tense and scary times for Israelis and Palestinians, with rocket attacks and airstrikes occurring daily. On July 16, an Israeli strike killed four children playing on a Gaza beach. After a temporary cease-fire, the situation escalated further the next night when a ground operation started with Israeli tanks entering Gaza. Over the weekend, the fighting continued to intensify, with the increasing death toll of Palestinian militants, Israeli soldiers and civilians from both sides. Some travelers are questioning their safety and reevaluating their scheduled trips, but others remain committed to going. Israel warns it may further expand Gaza operation . Jennifer Tapiero has waited her whole life to visit Israel, and the 25-year-old talk radio host finally was about to embark on July 13. Her plans changed that day, when family members in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem called and told Tapiero and her sister not to come. With increasing rocket strikes, they didn't believe the women would be safe there, even though they were traveling with an experienced tour group. ""We canceled right before the plane was supposed to take off,"" said Tapiero, a Los Angeles resident. ""Our family was so worried for us."" While Tapiero is deeply saddened by the events of the past few days, she's also glad she didn't go, knowing that her safety couldn't be guaranteed. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines responded to the increased violence last week, waiving fees to reschedule certain flights to Tel Aviv. More than the 3.5 million people visited Israel in 2013, a record, according to the country's Central Bureau of Statistics (PDF). Before the recent violence, the bureau reported a record 1.4 million visitors for the first half of 2014, but the latest outbreak is expected to affect the numbers. Anywhere from 15% to 25% of vacationers cut their stays short because of the violence as of Tuesday, when CNN spoke with Yossi Fatael, managing director of the Israel Tourist and Travel Agents Association. Fatael said that about 25% of travelers were canceling upcoming trips. Even if the conflict eases over the next few days, Fatael expects to see summer bookings down about 30%. He predicts that it will take several months for the country's travel industry to recover. With a trip scheduled for September, would-be first-time visitor Eli Arias of Los Angeles feels unsure about his travel plans. Although he was aware of the tension in the area when he booked his trip two months ago, he didn't think the violence would escalate to this point. He was planning to travel alone, and his family in the United States has expressed concern over his going. At this point, he's undecided about the trip but knows he still wants to ""experience this beautiful country."" What makes Jerusalem so sacred? Taglit-Birthright Israel, a group that provides free educational trips to Israel for Jewish teens, said that at the beginning of the crisis, it was seeing 5% to 10% daily cancellations. That percentage had increased this week, but there's been no further increase since Thursday's events. However, the group doesn't think it will affect travelers once the conflict dies down. ""It's only natural to expect a small drop in arrival at such times,"" said Taglit-Birthright CEO Gidi Mark. On Monday, the U.S. State Department updated its February travel warning for Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, recommending that travelers postpone all nonessential travel to the Israel and the West Bank. The warning also urges citizens to avoid all travel to Gaza, saying it is ""under the control of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization."" In the United Kingdom, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is advising against all travel to Gaza and said it was unable to offer consular assistance to citizens heading to the region. The office also recommended avoiding nonessential travel to areas of Israel within 25 miles of the Gaza border. (That would not include Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.) The Australian and Canadian governments have also issued alerts advising against travel to Gaza. The violence isn't enough to dissuade some travelers. Eboni Johnson of New Orleans has planned a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in November, and she still plans to go with a religious tour group. For Johnson, it's not just a vacation. It's a spiritual awakening in which she'll experience the places she reads about every day in the Bible. ""I truly believe Israel is chosen and special to God,"" Johnson said. ""I'm not concerned about what is going on, because I trust that God would keep me from all harm."" For Larry Ritter, president of New Jersey-based Israel Tour Connection, the impact has been mixed. ""We had tour groups there when the violence broke out last week,"" said Ritter, whose travel company offers religious and general tours of Israel. ""They all stayed until the end of their scheduled trip."" Travelers scheduled for tours with the company aren't feeling so secure. The company had groups scheduled to leave on Sunday, and Ritter expected about half of the 35 tour group participants to cancel. Most were likely to be families traveling with children, he said. On Monday, Ritter's company announced that it had put together a last-minute solidarity mission to the country. He'll be leaving Saturday, along with 40 rabbis, priests and pastors who simply want to show support for Israeli citizens. Ritter said that Thursday's escalation of the conflict caused an influx of sign-ups. ""There's an emotional connection between Israel and people that transcends personal safety,"" Ritter said. Jerusalem's five most contested sites . Other companies are experiencing different results. Offering a range of trips for Muslims, Christians, Jewish and interfaith travelers, Virginia-based MEJDI Tours hasn't had any cancellations as of Friday morning, said office manager Haley Douglass. ""Many of the phone calls and e-mails I have received are from travelers asking about the situation, hoping that their tour is not canceled,"" she said. An Islamic-focused tour of Israel scheduled for late July with Ahalan Olympus Ltd. was canceled a few days after the crisis started, according to owner and general manager Kfir Schwarz. Because of the holy month of Ramadan, very few Muslim tourists are traveling anyway, he said. It's normal for all travelers to feel some sort of anxiety during times of violence, says Peter Vlitas of Protravel International in New York. The travel agent's job is to keep customers up to date on the situation. ""We don't wait for them to come to us,"" Vlitas said. ""We reach out to our clients and advise them of State Department and UK travel advisories, and present them with their facts and options."" Abram Murray of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is glad he took his first trip to Israel and the West Bank in May through a tour group. Although he didn't notice any violence during his visit, and the places he visited on the West Bank were far from the current conflict zone, he's not sure he'd feel safe traveling to Israel now. ""With tensions and fighting escalating these days, I'm glad that I went when I did,"" Murray said. ""I'm not sure if I'd want to go over there right now.""

"WESTERN DESERT, Iraq (CNN) -- The hot wind swirls around the human bones and cracked skulls that litter the forsaken desert lands in Western Iraq. The entrance to the bunker complex where al Qaeda terrorized enemies in Iraq. We are standing in the middle of what was an al Qaeda execution site, just outside an intricate bunker complex that the organization used to torture and murder its victims, the bodies left to rot or be eaten by animals. From the back of the police truck the opening to the first bunker is barely discernible in the distance. ""Al Qaeda came in as a massive force"" one of the officers says as we bump along the harsh terrain. ""They stole our cars, our personal cars. They kidnapped two of my brothers. They blew up the house over there."" In the distance we can see his village -- a set of sand colored homes surrounded by parched farmlands. As we approach grubby children chase the truck and then stand to the side, despondent, as the officer points to their home. ""Their father was killed by al Qaeda,"" he says. In 2007 the U.S. military launched a series of airstrikes that drove out al Qaeda. As we enter the first bunker Captain Khaled Bandar tells us they found the floor littered with bodies. A gaping hole is evidence of the U.S. firepower. Insurgents used the layered and intricate labyrinth of passageways and hatches to carry out summary trials and executions. The police show us clothing and shoes, saying they are leaving them in place in case the families of the victims decide to come back. The stench of decay still lingers. Al Qaeda has been on the defensive in recent years, notwithstanding spectacular attacks attributed to the group like last week's blasts in the capital, including suicide truck bomb attacks on the ministries of foreign affairs and finance.  At least 100 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. But the concerted security campaign against the group has forced it to change its structure and strategy. According to one man who has close connections to al Qaeda in Iraq and asked not to be identified, the group lost support because it lost the protection of the people. ""There is an old saying about the basics of war. Whoever wins the people wins the war. So when al Qaeda didn't win the people over, it lost its battles,"" he explains. ""Al Qaeda's strategy of taking control of areas has been abandoned for now. Their method is propaganda, instilling fear, terrorizing."" He adds that the group stopped recruiting over the last six months because of a shortage in funding and increased infiltration. ""Al Qaeda is moving towards selecting the elite and condensing its forces rather than expanding. The Americans nearly defeated al Qaeda by cornering it and reducing its operations,"" he says. But those operations are still deadly, and the war is by no means over. ""No, the war is not over in Iraq, a type of battle is over, but there are new battles cloaked in politics. Now politicians try to pay militias, al Qaeda, or armed factions ...in order to eliminate political foes,"" the man with knowledge of al Qaeda says. And al Qaeda is still able to send a message to those who dare oppose them. The police officers show us blood stains in the desert near the bunkers and tell us how they found two beheaded bodies just a month ago. They were identified as being the brothers of two police officers from another city, Ramadi. Meanwhile, al Qaeda's global war has sifted to a place it believes it can still win -- Afghanistan. ""Al Qaeda in Afghanistan is made up of true believers, those who believe in jihad and fighting, and that's why they joined,"" the man with connections says. ""As for most of al Qaeda in Iraq's members, they are just looking to benefit themselves, or they join out of resentment for a certain sect or to avenge their families."" As for Iraq's longterm stability, that very much still hangs in the balance. He says: ""Peace will not be achieved by a magic wand or the rhetoric of a politician. Peace will be accomplished through the will of the Iraqi youth. We have to wait for this generation to change ... so that a generation that hates (the violence) will emerge.""

"Dallas (CNN)A generation of troops have served grueling tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq since the 9/11 attacks, but few have gripped the country's conscience in the way Chris Kyle has. In the autobiography that inspired the blockbuster film ""American Sniper,"" Kyle wrote that his work on Iraqi battlefields earned him the nickname ""Legend."" That's what those fighting with Kyle called him. His enemies used another nickname. They dubbed him ""al-Shaitan Ramad,"" or the Devil of Ramadi, indicating the fear a man can instill in his foes when he's capable of taking out a target from a distance of almost 1.2 miles. Of course, he wasn't the only sniper engaged in those epic battles of the Iraq War, but the legend of Kyle resonates with a wide American audience. Not only did his autobiography spend weeks on best-seller lists, but the Clint Eastwood-directed film, which has earned six Oscar nominations, including best picture, has shattered the box-office record for a war movie, previously held by ""Saving Private Ryan."" Despite all the talk of war's complications, Kyle's view of the Iraq War was unapologetically simplistic. ""I wanted to go to war. I signed up to protect this country. I do not choose the wars. It happens that I love to fight,"" he wrote in his autobiography. After completing four tours of duty in Iraq with at least 160 confirmed sniper kills, Kyle said he never had regrets about plying his deadly trade. Even if he had to take out a woman cradling a toddler -- as he reportedly did on his first sniper assignment -- he had no qualms pulling the trigger if it saved the lives of the Marines whom he was charged with protecting. ""It was my duty to shoot and I don't regret it,"" Kyle wrote in his book. ""After the first kill, the others come easy. I don't have to psych myself up, or do anything special mentally."" Fame weighs on trial of accused killer . As a Navy SEAL, Kyle fought in some of the Iraq War's most vicious battles, including Falluja, Ramadi and Sadr City, and while 160 was his tally of confirmed kills, he had 95 probable kills that couldn't be verified. His reputation for taking out insurgents resulted in an $80,000 bounty being placed on his head during the war. Kyle's autobiography, which he wrote with the help of authors Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, was published eight months after SEAL Team Six executed the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. That historic operation spurred fascination with the inner workings and personalities that make up one of the U.S. military's most secret and elite forces, yet many military veterans are leery of all the attention Kyle has received. Kyle, they say, was one of tens of thousands of troops who served heroically in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""You remove Chris Kyle from the story, there's 20,000 other heroes that you can put in there,"" said CNN global affairs analyst James Reese, who runs Tiger Swan, a security consulting firm founded by ex-members of the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force. Reese, who himself was a sniper, and served separately as a Delta Force commander during battles in Falluja, said special forces operators carry a mystique that appeals to Americans who've never served in the military. ""They are very dynamic,"" Reese said. ""People are drawn to them. They are American heroes. But they're all American heroes."" But there is a side to Kyle that's overlooked. It's left out of the book and movie, but a series of now-debunked stories have served only to make Kyle's legend larger. In his autobiography, Kyle wrote about a confrontation with a celebrity whom he called ""Scruff Face,"" later identified as former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Kyle claimed in his book that Ventura told him that the SEALs ""deserve to lose a few"" in the wars and then, ""I laid him out."" Ventura said the incident never happened and sued Kyle for defamation. Last year, a jury ordered Kyle's estate to pay Ventura nearly $2 million. The verdict is being appealed. It is just one story in a collection of outlandish tales that Kyle reportedly repeated often. Kyle bragged about traveling into New Orleans in the days after Hurricane Katrina with a fellow sniper and shooting at least 30 looters from the roof of the Superdome. There's no evidence anything of the sort ever occurred. And then there's the story Kyle told of how he killed two men who tried to carjack him while he was stopped at a gas station along a rural highway southwest of Dallas. When police arrived to investigate and ran his driver's license, Kyle said, they received a phone number for someone at the Department of Defense. The story ends with the police officers letting Kyle drive away. Kyle told the gas station story to Michael Mooney, a writer for D Magazine who was working on a profile. Mooney spent months trying to verify the story, he said. He interviewed people at every gas station along the stretch of highway where the shooting allegedly happened. He spoke with state and local law enforcement officials in three counties. Nobody had ever heard of the incident. ""He was a hero. He was the most celebrated war hero of our time,"" Mooney said. ""It's really hard to know what to think. We don't know. The fact is he was killed, and there's no way to get an answer from him now."" CNN asked Kyle's widow, Taya, to shed light on why her husband told these stories, but she declined the interview request. A representative said she was not available to speak about the incidents. At Kyle's funeral, which, befitting the grandeur of his legend, was held in the Dallas Cowboys' massive football stadium, Taya Kyle did not shy away from her husband's darker side. ""I don't need to romanticize Chris because our reality is messy, passionate, full of every extreme emotion known to man, including fear, compassion, anger and pain,"" she said. Despite his well-reported shortcomings, it's difficult to overlook his life after the Navy and how he touched and inspired so many people. While he was working to launch a security company -- Craft International, whose motto is, ""Despite what your momma told you, violence does solve problems"" -- Kyle dedicated much time to helping fellow veterans with mental health issues transition back to normal life after the battlefield. The struggle consumed him in many ways. ""War one day; peace the next,"" Kyle wrote in his book. It's also the work that led to his February 2, 2013, death. Kyle had taken his friend, Chad Littlefield, and fellow veteran Eddie Ray Routh to the firing range that day. A hunting guide would later find Kyle and Littlefield dead. Routh was charged in their deaths. A jury was seated Monday and opening statements in the capital murder trial are slated to begin Wednesday. For many of the military's elite, the decision to leave the battlefield is an excruciating one. The sense of duty to protect fellow troops is a feeling that Kyle struggled to let go. There's also a sense of glory and power that snipers find hard to walk away from. ""We're trained to go out and kill people,"" Chris Kyle wrote in his autobiography. ""And then at the same time, we're also being taught to think of ourselves as invincible bad asses. That's a pretty potent combination."" Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran.

"Chicago (CNN) -- More than two dozen people filled a Chicago courtroom Tuesday, listening to testimony in the case of the murdered relatives of Grammy-winning singer Jennifer Hudson. Hudson was seated beside her fiance as witnesses recalled the harrowing events of a rainy day in October 2008, when the singer's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and her brother Jason Hudson, 29, were shot dead. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle. Her former brother-in-law, William Balfour, is charged with their murders. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Sgt. Richard Dowling, the first police officer to arrive at the murder scene, said he found Hudson's mother lying face down with a gunshot wound to her back. Dowling next found her brother on a bed, he testified, though he recalled that he had difficulty identifying the man because he had been wrapped in blankets. Police searched the home for Julian, issuing an Amber Alert when their initial sweep failed. Police officer Jennifer Bryk testified that she was next to Hudson's sister, Julia, who at the time was separated from Balfour, when he called her after the attack. Full transcript of Tuesday's morning testimony | afternoon testmony . Bryk instructed the woman ""to act normal"" in her conversation to help authorities locate Balfour. Later Tuesday, an acquaintance of Balfour's, Abdullah Smith, 37, testified that the defendant had confided in him, telling him that he was having marital problems. Balfour showed him a text message from Julia Hudson, he said, that told him she didn't love him anymore. Smith also recalled how Balfour once told him that he wished he could beat up Jason Hudson but never heard of him threatening his wife, Donerson or Julian. Several gruesome crime scene photos were entered into evidence on Tuesday, the second day of testimony. They showed the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother. Court is expected to resume at 10:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) on Wednesday. On Monday, Hudson -- the prosecution's first witness -- broke down in tears several times on the stand as she recalled her relatives' murders. ""None of us wanted her to marry him,"" she said of her sister's decision to marry Balfour. ""We did not like how he treated her."" Read a full PDF transcript of Jennifer Hudson's testimony . Through tears, she talked about the last time she saw her family together and the day she found out about the deaths. ""I did everything in my power to get home,"" Hudson said. She testified that she identified her relatives' bodies for authorities. During cross-examination, the singer-actress, who was dressed in black, returned to the subject of Balfour. ""Where he was, I tried not to be,"" Hudson said. In the afternoon, her sister, Julia Hudson, took the stand. She said Balfour threatened to kill her family after she told him she didn't want to be with him. ""'If you leave me, you'll be the last to die. I'll kill your family first,' "" she quoted him as saying. She also said Balfour was jealous of her son. Julia Hudson recounted arriving home the day of the killings, finding a bullet hole in the door and running inside. ""I'm saying, 'Mama, mama, mama,'"" she said. ""She didn't answer."" She testified that she ran screaming from the home after finding her mother lying in blood on the floor. When police asked her who could have done it, Julia Hudson said, she told them ""William."" Eighteen people have been selected to serve on the jury: 10 women and eight men. The group includes six alternates. The judge has said he expects the trial to last three to four weeks. Balfour was detained for questioning the day after the victims were found at the Chicago home. The authorities said at the time that they were holding Balfour for an unspecified parole violation, but he was indicted for murder two months later. Balfour has also been charged with one count of home invasion. His lawyer has said in court that there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings. The deaths took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. Her career has continued to blossom and remain varied since her relatives' deaths. Her recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight; being cast to play Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie; releasing a new album; and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the most recent Grammy Awards show in February.","NEW: Court is expected to resume at 10:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) on Wednesday .

"MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN)  -- Gunmen attacked a convoy Sunday in Somalia and took several hostages, including two foreign aid workers from the group Doctors Without Borders. Medecins San Frontieres workers, shown here, were abducted and released in March in Sudan. Local staff said a three-car convoy was traveling from Rabbure to Hudur in southwestern Somalia, escorted by local bodyguards, when gunmen seized the group. The district commissioner of Rabbure said the only people released were elders accompanying the staff, with the local and international staff kept as hostages. Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres, did not immediately release the identities or nationalities of the hostages. MSF is an international medical group that works in more than 60 countries. It says it helps people ""threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe."" Michel Peremans, international coordinator for operational communications for MSF Belgium, which operates in the region, confirmed that the organization had lost contact with two of its staff in Somalia. Rabbure is in the Bakole region, which is under the control of the group al-Shabaab, considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. Al-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006. The ICU's former leader, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, became president after Ethiopian troops withdrew in January. Al-Shabaab rejected the peace agreement that led to the Ethiopian withdrawal and is now fighting Sheikh Ahmed's government. Attacks on aid workers in the region are common, and U.N. staff came under attack this year. In Sudan, on the other side of Ethiopia, four workers from Medecins Sans Frontieres were abducted in March and released a few days later. All four -- an Italian doctor, a Canadian nurse, a French coordinator and a Sudanese guard -- worked for the Belgian section of the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres. Sudan last month ordered 13 major aid groups to leave the country after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

"(CNN) -- The computers haven't proven to be our trivia overlords just yet. Give them at least until Wednesday. An IBM supercomputer named Watson finished one round of the TV show ""Jeopardy!"" on Monday night tied with one of his human competitors and $3,000 ahead of the other. The man vs. computer face-off won't be complete, however, until the final rounds of the extended trivia game show are aired on Tuesday and Wednesday. IBM trumpets Watson, which has been in development for years and has the processing power of 2,800 ""powerful computers,"" as a major advancement in machines' efforts to understand human language. The computer receives clues through digital texts and then buzzes in against the two other ""Jeopardy!"" contestants like any other player would. It juggles dozens of lines of reasoning at once and tries to arrive at a smart answer. After getting off to a scary-good start, Watson did have a few stumbles. In one instance, it repeated an answer that another contestant, Ken Jennings, who won 74 ""Jeopardy!"" episodes in a row, had already tried. ""What is 1920s?"" Watson said, sounding like a digitized Matthew Broderick. ""No,"" game-show host Alex Trebek replied. ""Ken said that."" On many other clues, however, Watson was spot-on. After losing the first clue to Brad Rutter, another ""Jeopardy!"" champion, Watson jumped in on the second question. Clue: ""Iron fitting on the hoof of a horse or a card-dealing box in a casino."" Watson: ""What is shoe?"" Correct. At the start of the show, Trebek went to some lengths to explain the origins of Watson -- IBM approached the show about the idea three years ago -- and how the computer actually works. That's partly because what you see on the ""Jeopardy!"" stage is somewhat misleading. It looks as if two humans are bookending a simple computer monitor, which appears to be just about as smart as they are. In reality, as Trebek explained, the bulk of Watson's computer power was stored in another building at an IBM lab in New York, where the show is being held for this special three-day competition. CNNMoney: Will IBM's Watson put your job in jeopardy? After introducing Watson, to studio applause, this is how Trebek explained it: . ""Just as I expected,"" he said. ""That was a very warm reception and I'm sure Watson would have appreciated the applause. Except for one thing: Watson can neither hear nor see. It will be receiving all of its information electronically. ""And as a matter of fact what you're looking at right now is not the real Watson. This is an avatar. This is a representation of Watson. Watson, or course, is a sophisticated computer system too big and too heavy to fit behind that lectern on our stage."" As for the stage version of Watson, his brain-face was represented by a digital Earth that swirled with ribbons of various colors while he thought about questions. As Trebek read the clues, a bar graph appeared at the bottom of the screen, showing the top three answers Watson was considering at that moment and how confident he was in those choices. Sometimes the computer managed to be confident but still incorrect. Here's the clue to the first question Watson got wrong: . ""From the Latin for end, this is where trains can also originate."" Watson: ""What is finis."" Confidence level: 97%. Trebek: ""No. Ken?"" ""What is terminus,"" Jennings answered correctly. Before ending the evening tied with Rutter at $5,000 each, Watson had jumped out to an early lead at the first commercial break. At that point, Watson had $5,200 and his closest noncomputer counterpart had only $1,000. Several Twitter users were awed by the computer's smarts. ""Watson kinda feakin' me out. Big time,"" Michael Gartenberg, a tech analyst, wrote on his Twitter feed. Another person wrote: ""Watson is almost scary. This is willld! These humans are no match for Watson's algorithms."" Trebek summed up the computer's mixed performance this way: . ""So, what have we learned so far: Watson's very bright, very fast, but he had some weird little moments once in a while."" Then he teased the upcoming shows: . ""And how many of those will we encounter tomorrow when we play double and final 'Jeopardy!'?""","IBM computer Watson finishes first round tied with 1 contestant, ahead of 2nd .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Hundreds of French workers, angry about proposed layoffs at a Caterpillar factory, were holding executives of the company hostage Tuesday, a spokesman for the workers said. Caterpillar's French staff say they are angry about a lack of negotiations over layoffs. It is at least the third time this month that French workers threatened with cutbacks have blockaded managers in their offices to demand negotiations. Executives were released unharmed in both previous situations. The latest incident started Tuesday morning at the office of the construction equipment company in the southeastern city of Grenoble. The workers were angry that Caterpillar had proposed cutting more than 700 jobs and would not negotiate, said Nicolas Benoit, a spokesman for the workers' union. They did not want to harm the Caterpillar executives, Benoit told CNN. One hostage was released Tuesday evening leaving workers with four captives inside the Caterpillar building. The released man was a human resources director identified only as Mr. Petit, because he has heart problems, union representative Bernard Patrick told CNN. Petit had a heart attack a few weeks ago, Patrick said. The four others still being held are Nicolas Polutnik, the head of operations; two other executives; and Petit's personal assistant, he said. About 500 employees were also outside the building protesting. A top Caterpillar executive called the hostage-taking unhelpful. ""The actions that are taking place today, led by a small minority of individuals, are not helping as we work for a positive resolution of this situation,"" said Chris Schena, Caterpillar vice president with responsibility for manufacturing operations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, in a statement. ""The best way to resolve this matter is to continue the negotiations through the Works Council to find a solution that's fair to our employees and allows Caterpillar to remain a leader in a rapidly changing global marketplace,"" Schena said, adding that the company was ""concerned for the safety of our employees."" Benoit said all the workers wanted to do was negotiate with Caterpillar and they were upset that the company did not show up to two earlier scheduled negotiating sessions. The employees being held in their office were being allowed to get food, Benoit added. Police arrived at the scene two hours after the incident began but it had not been settled. Employees at a French 3M factory held a manager hostage for more than 24 hours Wednesday and Thursday of last week over a dispute about terms for laid-off staff. Luc Rousselet, who was unharmed, was allowed to leave the plant in Pithiviers, central France, early on Thursday morning after talks between unions and officials from 3M France. Earlier this month, the boss of Sony France was held overnight before workers freed him after he agreed to reopen talks on compensation when the factory closed. France has been hit by nationwide strikes twice in the past two months.","NEW: Workers release one of five people being held hostage at Caterpillar factory .

"London (CNN) -- A former British prime minister who has been a harsh critic of media baron Rupert Murdoch is due to testify Monday at an enquiry spawned by phone-hacking at Murdoch's News of the World tabloid. Gordon Brown is due to take the stand at the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging probe set up by the British government to examine media ethics. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has already testified. Murdoch himself spent a day and a half on the stand earlier this year, and said that Gordon Brown had vowed to declare war on Murdoch's News Corp. after one its high-profile tabloids withdrew support for Brown's Labour party. Cameron, who has been under pressure because of his ties to Murdoch and his former newspaper chief Rebekah Brooks, is scheduled to testify all day Thursday at the Leveson Inquiry. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will be quizzed Monday, as will former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the inquiry's witness list shows. John Major, another ex-prime minister, will appear Tuesday, as will opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband and his deputy, Harriet Harman. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is scheduled to testify Wednesday, ahead of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. The judge-led Leveson Inquiry, set up by Cameron after the phone hacking scandal at Murdoch's News of the World newspaper last summer, is examining the relationship between the media and politicians. Blair, in his testimony, said he came under ""political pressure"" from Murdoch during his time in office but denied that his relationship with the media baron was too ""cozy."" In April, Cameron told politicians in the House of Commons: ""I think we all, on both sides of this house, did a bit too much cozying up to Mr. Murdoch."" Cameron has faced questions about his ties to Murdoch and Brooks, both of whom have also appeared before the inquiry, particularly in relation to News Corp.'s bid to take full control of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The attempt was abandoned amid the furor over phone hacking at News of the World, owned by News Corp.'s British subsidiary News International. Brooks detailed frequent contacts with Cameron in the run-up to the 2010 election and said she had received commiserations from the prime minister when she resigned from News International last summer. She and her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, were last month charged with interfering with the police investigation. Cameron's judgment in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his communications director has also been called into question. Coulson resigned from the Downing Street role early last year when police began a new phone-hacking investigation, saying it had become a distraction. He quit the News of the World after two employees were jailed over phone hacking in 2007 but denies knowing of wrongdoing while he was in charge. Coulson was last week arrested and charged with perjury over court testimony about phone hacking, according to Britain's Press Association news agency. The Leveson Inquiry was established by Cameron after British public anger at the News of the World about the hacking of voice messages of a missing teenage girl who turned out to have been murdered. The case of Milly Dowler came on top of apologies from the tabloid for the hacking of the phones of celebrities and politicians and proved to be the last straw for the paper, which was shut down in July. The inquiry is intended to explore press ethics in Britain more widely, alongside police investigations into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and police bribery by people working for Murdoch's British newspapers. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown allegedly ""declared war"" on Rupert Murdoch .

"(CNN)Lindsey Vonn is back on a podium. True, Vonn has barely been away from one. Just ask Tiger Woods, who lost a tooth when a camera hit him in the face while cheering Vonn onto the podium in Italy last month. But Tuesday's podium was special. It marked the ski superstar's first medal at a World Championships in four years. The 30-year-old came to this year's World Championships, in Beaver Creek, Colorado, having just set the all-time record for wins on the regular, season-long women's World Cup circuit. And she maintained some of that momentum to finish third in Tuesday's super-G, her opening event, behind Slovenia's Tina Maze and victorious Austrian Anna Fenninger. Fenninger won with a time of 1:10.29 in windy conditions, becoming the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic and world super-G titles. Before Fenninger's run, Vonn had temporarily led the field with 1:10.44. Not that Vonn celebrated her return to a major podium too wildly. ""I thought I skied pretty well,"" said the bronze medalist. ""I'm happy with the result. I just wish the weather was a little bit better."" Golfer Woods, undaunted by his dental disaster last month, once again turned up to support Vonn. His girlfriend last won a world medal in 2011 -- downhill silver in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany -- and previously won both the super-G and downhill world titles in 2009. She also took Olympic downhill gold and super-G bronze at the Vancouver 2010 Games. However, Vonn missed Sochi 2014 through injury. She crashed and tore ligaments racing in the super-G at the 2013 Worlds, then re-injured her knee in a training accident later that year. ""Sometimes good skiing is enough to overcome the weather,"" she added following this year's third-place finish. ""Sometimes it's not. Today, it wasn't enough. ""But I have to say, Anna Fenninger skied exceptionally well. She definitely deserved to win the gold medal today."" Vonn remains the favorite for Friday's downhill. Meanwhile, 37-year-old compatriot Bode Miller is set to race in Wednesday's men's super-G, despite only having completed training runs since undergoing back surgery three months ago.","Anna Fenninger wins super-G world title with Lindsey Vonn third .

"(CNN) -- Jazz has always been a popular form of music because its improvisatory nature is easily adapted by a community or nation to reflect its individual identity. Polish policemen watch a demonstration near the University in Warsaw in December 1981. In Poland, jazz has been intertwined with its politics and through it, has gained its own particular identity and recognition, as has Poland as a nation. The First World War marked a turning point in Polish history. After 300 years of divided rule under Prussia, Austria and Russia, Poland became an independent democratic republic lasting until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. The end of the First World War also marked the spread through Europe of American jazz. According to polishjazz.com, the first Polish jazz band was started in 1923 by Zygmunt Karasinski and Symon Kataszek, calling itself simply Karasinski & Kataszek Jazz-Tango Orchestra. It was an almost immediate success, playing in popular Warsaw venues of the time. Other popular dance bands established themselves during the 1920s and the first jazz recordings were being recorded by Polish record label Syrena Records. With the rise of the Nazis and accompanying anti-semitism under Adolf Hitler in neighboring Germany, Jewish musicians such as Ady Rosner and Erwin Woheller came to Poland, enriching the Polish jazz scene with their talent. Rosner became the best and most popular jazz musician, who later on in his life became a driving force of Soviet jazz. Throughout the 1930s, the music of American jazz artists such as Duke Ellington was widely available and popular, as were the first music magazines from London, Paris and America. This flourishing scene came to an abrupt end with the invasion and occupation of Poland by the German Army. The end of the war saw Poland being occupied yet again, this time by the Soviet Red Army. Poland, now called People's Republic of Poland, became a Soviet-controlled puppet state. Music fell under Soviet control too and jazz, with its syncopated rhythms and free style, did not fall into the prescribed mould. In Stalinist Poland, jazz was banned and went on to develop its own style underground. During the first half of the 1950s, the death of Joseph Stalin and Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment as First Secretary in the Polish regime had a more liberalizing effect on the country. Jazz was out in the open once more; being listened to, talked about and played without fear. The first jazz magazine behind the Iron Curtain was published; official jazz clubs were created and the Polish Jazz Federation was started by Jan Byrczek in 1964. Byrczek went on to found the Polish Jazz Society which became one of the largest jazz organisations of Europe. The 50s also saw the first official jazz festival taking place in Sopot beginning a tradition of jazz festivals in Poland that lasts to this day. Initial hopes that Gomulka's reforms would move towards democratisation were dashed but despite political obstacles, Poland's cultural and intellectual life continued to grow and flourish during the following decade. Jazz was being featured in TV programmes; jazz critique was growing as were jazz festivals. In 1964, the Jazz at the Oder River festival in Wroclaw started. Another milestone of the decade was the start of the recording of ""The Polish Jazz Series"" by the official recording label Polskie Nagrania-Muza. It continued doing so until well into the Eighties, later re-releasing all the volumes in CD format. During the 1970s, Edward Gierek replaced Gomulka as First Party Secretary. He, being on a more friendly footing with Western neighbors than his predecessors, received loans and with them, the slow trickle of Western goods (notably Coca Cola) and TV shows into Poland. The government's pro-Western stance also allowed Polish culture to reach out to the West. The leading Polish jazz magazine Jazz Forum was being published in Polish, English and German and distributed in 103 countries. Trumpeter Tomasz Stanko came to the fore during this period, receiving the first European Jazz Award in 2002 as one or Europe's most outstanding jazz musicians. Towards the end of the 70s, Gierek's political career came to a close after a wave of labor strikes resulting from his policies. It was in this turbulent time that the independent trade union, the Solidarity Movement, was started in the Gdansk shipyards by Lech Walesa. Solidarity's growing strength led General Jaruzelski to declare martial law in December 1981. However Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms in Soviet Russia; pressure from Polish Pope John Paul II and Western leaders forced the Communists to the negotiating table. This led to Solidarity's participation in semi-free elections 1989 resulting in a coalition government. Walesa became President of Poland until 1995. The political events were reflected in the jazz scene. The early 80s brought the ""Young Power"" movement lead by Krzysztof Popek. According to allaboutjazz.com, musician Cezary Lerski described his movement as being ""verbally critical and musically adventurous,"" revolutionzing Polish jazz. Popek is still a driving force of Polish Jazz today. One of the purely Polish streams of jazz are the interpretations of the music of Polish composer Frederic Chopin started by pianist Andrzej Jagodzinski. Reflecting the new freedom brought by democratisation another important band came to the fore at the beginning of the 90s. This was ""Milosc,"" playing free jazz, going so far as to describe its form of jazz as ""yass"" thereby creating a new stream or genre in Polish jazz. But it too followed the path of the Young Power Movement by becoming more mainstream. Current jazz reflects the diversity that democratic and economic freedom have brought Poland. A multiplicity of small jazz clubs have sprung up throughout the country as have a number of jazz festivals and independent record labels. Lersky writes that Polish jazz is"" mature, vibrant and evolving"" -- a reflection of the politics of the day?","History of Polish jazz has been intertwined with its politics .

"(CNN) -- Police departments in Chicago and New York are trading barbs after a federal judge ruled that New York City's stop-and-frisk policy was unconstitutional. ""Welcome to Chicago,"" a Bronx police officer told the New York Post after the ruling, insinuating that crime rates in New York would approach those of the embattled Midwestern city as a result of the ruling, which mandated changes to stop-and-frisk. Officials in Chicago responded by defending their city's reputation and taking a shot at New York's recent judicial defeat. ""We had significantly less crime, significantly fewer shootings and fewer murders of any year since 1965 without imposing on the right of our residents,"" said Adam Collins, the spokesman for the Chicago Police Department. ""We don't engage in racial profiling."" Names of innocent erased from records . A judge ruled Monday that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program was unconstitutional and it had been disproportionately used on black and Hispanic citizens. Chicago has its own controversial law enforcement policy called ""contact cards."" Under the contact card policy, police can stop individuals and demand information such as name, phone number and the disclosure of any tattoos. However, under the policy, officers do not make physical contact with the individual in question. Despite the controversies, both cities have seen significant reduction in crime. In 2013, Chicago became the center of a national discussion on hand gun violence when there were more than 500 killings in the city. More than a decade earlier, in 1990, there were more than 2000 slayings in New York in that single calendar year. Both cities have seen more than a 25% reduction in homicides and in shootings in 2013 and are on pace for less than 400 murders for the year. As for what started the whole war of words, ""I'll leave any further opinions on that to other folks,"" Collins said.

"San Sebastian de los Reyes, Spain (CNN) -- Just weeks after a Chicago writer known as a veteran, expert bull runner was badly gored in Pamplona, he's back at other smaller bull runnings in Spain, but walking with a cane. ""I really didn't think he was gonna gore me until it happened. I really thought I was going to find a way to escape,"" said Bill Hillmann, who helped write a book, ""Fiesta, How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona,"" shortly before a bull's horn tore into his right thigh. That was July 9, the third day of Pamplona's historic, annual eight consecutive days of running, which Hillmann says he's run daily for numerous years. A bull got separated from the other five bulls toward the end of the 850-meter (half-mile) course. Hillmann was trying to help lead the lone bull toward the nearby bullring, but says he was pushed from behind, tripped and fell. ""I've learned from this. I'll always be much more worried about who's behind me 'cause now I know, if I'm not aware of there being first timers behind me or inexperienced guys, it could be me gored,"" said Hillmann, who turned 33 this month. He's facing a â‚¬9,000 (nearly $12,000) bill for hospital services in Pamplona, but is undaunted and is finishing a new book on how running with the bulls has changed his life. ""I wasn't sure how I was going to end the book, but now I'm pretty sure the ending is going to be the goring,"" he said. Expert American bull runner gored in Pamplona . Running with bulls 'tradition' not cruelty . Pamplona's running of the bulls dates back centuries and became world famous thanks to novelist Ernest Hemingway. But numerous other Spanish towns hold their own bull running each year, and Hillman arrived this week in San Sebastian de los Reyes, near Madrid, for its running. In these towns, he tends to catch up with with a small group of other traveling men -- Spaniards and foreigners -- who have become regular, serial bull runners. Hillmann brushes off criticism that the running of the bulls is animal cruelty. ""I don't see anything cruel about it,"" he insists. ""The animals, they're just running. They don't get hurt in any way during the run."" But they do tend to get killed in bullfights later that day. Surviving Pamplona's running of the bulls . Yet Hillmann points to the old traditions involving the bull-running events. ""I think it's fun, it's exciting,"" Hillmann said of the running. ""I think it's stupid for people who know nothing about a tradition to judge someone who knows a lot about it and who loves it."" In San Sebastian de los Reyes, a group of Englishman proudly completed their first-ever bull running, and came across Hillmann, who was asked to pull up his right pants leg to show his hefty scar. They asked if Hillmann would keep running and he said yes, although he doesn't expect that to be until next summer, after he's fully healed. ""I need to build up my courage again,"" he said, earlier in the day. ""It's gotten a lot scarier now that I know exactly how dangerous it is, now that it's a reality."" After reviewing video and photos on a laptop computer of the day he was gored, Hillmann grimaced, and said, ""Of course it was worth it. I knew the day I would get gored was coming. I was hoping I'd survive. ""I was hoping it wouldn't stop me from continuing to run, and I was lucky enough to survive and it looks like I'm going to be able to run again.""

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts teen was convicted Wednesday of homicide as a result of texting while driving and will serve one year in prison. In a landmark case for the state, Aaron Deveau, 18, was found guilty on charges of vehicular homicide, texting while driving and negligent operation of a motor vehicle in a 2011 crash that fatally injured Donald Bowley, 55, of Danville, New Hampshire, and seriously injured a passenger in Bowley's car. ""I made a mistake,"" Deveau said Wednesday after his mother told the district court in Haverhill, Massachusetts he would not intentionally hurt anyone. ""If I could take it back, I would take it back."" Judge Stephen Abany sentenced the teen to two and a half years on the vehicular homicide charge and two years on the texting and causing injury charge. He will serve one year concurrently on both charges and the balance of both charges is suspended for five years. His license will be suspended for 15 years. ""There are no winners today,"" Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement. ""A beloved grandfather is dead. A once active woman can no longer work and is still racked with pain from her injuries and a young man is going to jail. When we get behind the wheel of a car, we are obligated to drive with care. ... As we saw in this case, in a split second, many lives are forever changed."" The risks of texting while driving . In the February 20, 2011, accident, prosecutors said, Deveau's car crossed the center line on a street in Haverhill, which is in northeast Massachusetts near New Hampshire, and hit the vehicle Bowley was driving. Bowley's girlfriend, Luz Roman, 59, was in his car with him and suffered serious injuries. Haverhill Detective Thomas Howell testified the impact left the two ""almost folded into the floorboards."" Bowley died March 10, 2011, after he was taken off life support. ""My brother received such head trauma that ... there was no hope for him,"" Bowley's sister, Donna Burleigh, said in court. Roman talked about the incident's continued impact. ""Loss of sleeping, loss of my boyfriend. So many losses, I can't tell you how many,"" she told the judge. Essex Assistant District Attorney Ashlee Logan argued that Deveau may have erased some of his texts or lied to police after the accident about when he was texting. Deveau said after the crash in a taped interview with police, which was played in court, ""I was tired. I was distracted. When I looked away for one quick second, I came too close to her and I was trying to hit my brakes."" His defense lawyer said authorities set out from the beginning to link texting to the crash, a cause-and-effect relationship that he contends is not valid. Some 38 states ban text messaging for all drivers, while 31 prohibit all cell phone use by ""novice drivers,"" according to the Governor's Highway Safety Association. 2011: NTSB urges ban on use of phones while driving .","Defendant says he wishes he could take back ""mistake""

"(CNN) -- At my heaviest, I weighed 385 pounds. I never dared to dream I could run anywhere, never mind finish a half marathon. Yet on April 27, 2013, I weighed 219 pounds. At 3:30 a.m., I ate breakfast, hydrated, laced up my shoes and headed to Centennial Park in Nashville, because I was running the St. Jude Country Music Half Marathon. It had taken a village to get me to this day. This run was for Darbi, my best friend since college and her partner Anje, the two people that have taught me about the best me I can be. It was for Team Rio, the running group that became like family to me. It was for April, my CNN Fit Nation trainer. The 13.1 miles I was about to run weren't about the race itself, but about everything -- and everyone -- it took to get me there. Behind the scenes: Training for a triathlon . Anje is the biggest reason I've been able to lose more than 150 pounds. She became my trainer last June, then became one my biggest inspirations. In November 2012 Anje was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She and I had been working on getting me to my goal weight, which is how we decided to run a 5k and a half marathon in 2013. The plan was to do them together. I will never forget how scared I was, the anger I felt or the tears I cried, the day I heard her say, ""I have cancer."" With a cancer diagnosis, Anje and Darbi should've been thinking about anything except me, but that's not the kind of hearts they have. Both were worried about how this was going to affect the plans Anje and I had made. So Darbi stepped in with her ""I got this"" swagger and picked up where Anje was forced leave off. I still wonder how she did it sometimes. She would work out with me, work endlessly, go to all of Anje's doctor appointments and take care of everything at home. I know she was terrified, but never once did she complain. She's a true testament to the human spirit. Anje's doctor decided she needed a complete hysterectomy, with possible radiation and/or chemo to follow, depending on what the surgery uncovered. Surgery was set for December 26. While Anje was in surgery, I was in the waiting room with Darbi. Believe it or not, that was the same day I did my first phone interview for CNN Fit Nation. When Anje woke up from surgery, the first thing she said to me was, ""Did you talk to CNN?"" I was now training for two races. Johanna, my Team Rio running coach, made sure April got my full running training plan. April then built the half training into my triathlon training. Some days it was a bit overwhelming, but I was the one who wanted this. I knew what I had to do, so I stuck to the plan and kept running. While I was training, Anje was undergoing five weeks of radiation therapy. On April 13, I had my first true ""runner's high."" I had 12 miles to run, my longest distance before the half. The group was small that day so one of the coaches decided to run with me. We like to talk so we kept the pace conversational. Out of that run came a favorite phrase of mine: ""What's the bigger beach?"" You don't need the story behind it to understand what it means.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Marine Corps knew of the threat posed by roadside bombs before the start of the Iraq war, yet did nothing to buy protective vehicles for troops, according to a report to be released by the Pentagon. Marines' armored Humvees are parked at a miltary camp in Fallujah, Iraq, in May 2007. Additionally, Marine leaders in 2005 decided to buy up-armored, or reinforced, Humvees instead of Mine Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles to shield troops in Iraq from mines and other explosives -- a decision that could have cost lives, according to the report obtained Tuesday by CNN. The report by the Department of Defense inspector general was requested by the Marine Corps in early 2008 after a civilian employee with the service complained that bureaucratic delays undermined the program to develop the armored vehicles. Inspectors found that the decision not to buy MRAP vehicles in 2005 stopped the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the agency in charge of finding the best protective vehicle from troops in Iraq, from ""developing a course of action ... to attempt to obtain funding for [MRAPs],"" according to the report. The report found that the Department of Defense knew before the war started in 2003 of the threats of mines and roadside bombs in Iraq but did nothing to acquire ""MRAP-type"" vehicles ahead of the invasion. ""As a result, the department entered into operations in Iraq without having taken available steps to acquire technology to mitigate the known mine and IED risk to soldiers and Marines,"" the report said. In response to the report, Marine Corps spokesman Maj. David Nevers pointed out the inspector general found no ""evidence of criminal negligence"" in the Corps' actions. The decision to buy the up-armored Humvee model, he said, was made ""consciously by the Marine Corps leadership because of its proven capability to protect and its tactical utility; the survivability and mobility demanded by the Marines in theater; and its availability, based on an active, responsive production line."" ""The Marine Corps fully cooperated with [inspector general] during this audit,"" Nevers said. ""We are reviewing the report to ensure that our processes best support the war fighter in theater."" A civilian whistle-blower working with the Marine Corps on the MRAP program wrote a scathing report about delays in the procurement process in early 2008. ""If the mass procurement and fielding of MRAPs had begun in 2005 in response to the known and acknowledged threats at that time, as the USMC is doing today, hundreds of deaths and injuries could have been prevented,"" Franz Gayl wrote in his January report. He said bureaucratic delays plagued the program at the height of the insurgency, when U.S. troops were regularly being attacked and killed by roadside bombs. Gayl's report prompted the Marine Corps to request the inspector general's audit in 2008. The Gayl report drew attention just months after MRAPs had been pushed into Iraq by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in an effort to protect troops from roadside bombs -- the leading killer of troops at the time.","Report: Buying reinforced Humvees, not MRAPs, possibly cost lives .

"(CNN) -- Every dog has his day, but Sir Lancelot -- or at least his carbon copy -- has a second one. Edgar and Nina Otto show off 10-week-old Lancey, a clone of ""the most human of any dog we've ever had."" A Boca Raton, Florida, couple paid a California firm $155,000 to clone their beloved Labrador retriever, who died from cancer a year ago. The clone, a 10-week-old puppy dubbed Lancey, was hand-delivered to them earlier this week by Lou Hawthorne, chairman of BioArts International, a biotechnology company. ""One minute with Lancey and you know he's special. He's both extremely aware and very sweet,"" Hawthorne said in a BioArts statement. Edgar and Nina Otto said they began thinking about cloning Sir Lancelot about five years ago. ""I said 'Well, you know, it wouldn't hurt to have his DNA frozen,' and that's what we did,"" Nina Otto told CNN affiliate WPBF. The Ottos were one of five families to bid and win a BioArts auction for a chance to clone their family dog, according to a BioArts statement. Lancey is the world's first commercially cloned dog, the company said; the Ottos are the first of six current clients to receive their clone. Sir Lancelot's DNA sample was sent to the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation in Seoul, South Korea, which provides cloning services to BioArts. Researchers there put the DNA into an egg, and Lancey was born November 18, according to BioArts. The Ottos said they have had many beloved dogs over the years -- and have nine others currently -- but maintain Sir Lancelot was special. ""Sir Lancelot was the most human of any dog we've ever had,"" Edgar Otto said in the BioArts statement. ""He was a prince among dogs."" In an interview with WPBF, Edgar Otto said Sir Lancelot ""was a very, very, very special dog to us. And we've given a lot more to the Humane Society than we've ever spent on this project.""  Watch the Ottos talk about Lancelot and Lancey » . For its part, the Humane Society of the United States says it's against the commercial cloning of animals. ""Given the current pet overpopulation problem, which costs millions of animals their lives and millions in public tax dollars each year, the cloning of pets has no social value and in fact may lead to increased animal suffering,"" the organization said on its Web site. ""For those looking to replace a lost pet, cloning will not create an animal identical to the one who is gone; cloning cannot replicate an animal's uniqueness. Cloning can only replicate the pet's genetics, which influence but do not determine his physical attributes or personality."" The Ottos, however, said replicating Sir Lancelot's genetics is enough for them. Edgar Otto said he realizes Lancey might not be just like their departed dog, but ""if he's different, we're not going to love him any less."" Edgar Otto is the son of the late Edwin Otto, who was part of the founding of NASCAR and a ""motorsports pioneer,"" according to www.ottomotorsports.com.","Couple won auction to clone family dog, biotech company says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential ""American Bandstand,"" has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said. He was 82. Clark suffered a heart attack while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for an outpatient procedure, his publicist said Wednesday. ""Attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful."" The family has not yet decided whether there will be a public memorial service for the multifaceted Clark, although Shefrin said, ""There will be no funeral."" Clark suffered what was then described as ""a mild stroke"" in December 2004, just months after announcing he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve"" specials. He returned as a co-host with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2005. Clark anguished each year over whether to continue appearing on the annual show because of limitations on his speech from the stroke, U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a longtime friend, told CNN Wednesday. ""But then he would get deluged by people who were stroke victims and other people who had infirmities and they were such admirers of his fighting spirit,"" said Dreier, R-California. Share your memories of Dick Clark . Clark's ""American Bandstand"" work, which he began when it was a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956, earned him the nickname ""America's oldest living teenager."" The dance show was picked up by ABC and broadcast nationally a year later. ""If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet,"" singer Aretha Franklin told ""AC360."" The savvy entrepreneur was a pioneer in introducing African-American and other performers to millions of young TV viewers. His audiences were integrated, among the first on television. ""Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark,"" said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961. Entertainers told CNN on Wednesday that Clark knew that music transcends race. ""Dick understood the connection that music had. It wasn't about black, it wasn't about white,"" Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men told ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Seacrest gave a statement to CNN expressing deep sadness for ""the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark."" ""He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life,"" Seacrest said. ""I idolized him from the start, and I was graced early on in my career with his generous advice and counsel. When I joined his show in 2006, it was a dream come true to work with him every New Year's Eve for the last six years."" Seacrest called Clark ""smart, charming, funny and always a true gentleman."" Another major figure on the music scene was too upset to talk about Clark's death. Radio host Casey Kasem's wife, Jean, told CNN that Clark served as substitute host for Kasem's popular ""American Top 40."" ""We just feel that he was one of the most magnanimous human beings that we ever knew in the industry,"" Jean Kasem said of Clark. Clark became wealthy as a businessman, producing successful TV shows through Dick Clark Productions. He created the American Music Awards in the 1970s, a competitor to the Grammy Awards. He sold the company to Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder in 2007. ""One of the real draws when we purchased Dick Clark Productions was the opportunity to build on the tremendous foundation of programming that this icon of American broadcasting created,"" Snyder said Wednesday. ""I got to know Dick over the past five years, and he was just as personable and warm in person as he was on television. Once you got to know Dick, it was obvious why he was so beloved by his fans. He was, in every sense of the word, a giant."" Born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, New York, on November 30, 1929, he began his broadcast career working at a radio station managed by his father. Clark, who was married three times, is survived by his wife, Kari, two sons and a daughter. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Clark in its nonperformer category in 1993. Clark also hosted numerous other television favorites, including the ""Pyramid"" game shows and ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes."" ""This guy was the best,"" said singer Freddy Cannon, who appeared on ""American Bandstand"" 110 times. ""He helped me from the very bottom of my career all through the '80s and the '90s, and he's going to be missed a lot."" Former CNN talk host Larry King said Clark's secret for success was his ability to be natural on camera. ""The hardest thing in the business is to be yourself, and no one knew that better than Dick Clark,"" King said. Singer Donny Osmond said Clark was one of a kind: ""If someone cannot fill your shoes, you are a legend. And Dick Clark was a legend."" Clark's passing follows by less than three months the death of another TV dance show icon, Don Cornelius, the creator of ""Soul Train.""

"Washington (CNN) -- On the 47th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington on Saturday, the first sight on the National Mall for thousands of marchers was a four-story art installation that displayed four images and quotations of Martin Luther King Jr.. The participants in Glenn Beck's ""Restoring Honor"" rally paused as they walked toward the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. Some stopped to have pictures taken with King as the backdrop. As recordings of King's booming baritone filled the air, some of the Beck followers laughed and others booed. Some looked for someone to argue their case that King's dream was passé, no more relevant to today's politics than the race to the moon. Michael Murphy, an artist from Georgia, created a four-story structure that celebrates King to honor King's spirit and to counter the rallies by Beck and the Rev. Al Sharpton. Four images, each with passages from King's speeches, can be viewed from different perspectives. Rev. Jim Wallis, speaking at a celebration of King's life near the temporary art installation, acknowledged the ""angry discussions about the legacy of this man."" A Beck marcher ran up to someone admiring the art and called out: ""We'll be free again -- in November."" America's political atmosphere at the time of the Beck and Sharpton rallies sometimes seems more toxic than the politics of 1963. Beck has likened the policies of President Obama's administration to those of Adolf Hitler and calls him a communist. Some in the Tea Party movement have questioned Obama's patriotism and insinuated that he is an al Qaeda sympathizer. In fact, the political climate surrounding King's 1963 march was tougher. But King and the civil rights movement provided a moral vision that made it possible for the U.S. to find a way out of those ugly times. The summer of 1963 produced as much conflict as almost any other year in American history. After King's Birmingham, Alabama, campaign, more than 2,000 demonstrations broke out across the nation. More than 50,000 people were jailed. Many protests got violent. NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi. Protesters in Danville, Virginia, got pummeled within an inch of their lives, then subjected to persecution. The governor of Maryland declared martial law in Cambridge. That summer, the civil rights campaigners moved north. Protests in New York, Philadelphia, Newark, Chicago and San Francisco took a dramatic turn toward incivility. Frustrated by years of inattention, renters in Philly dumped mountains of garbage in front of slumlords' suburban homes. Malcolm X sneered at Jews. ""You haven't got no time to cry no tears for no Jews,"" he called out at the Harlem Unity Rally. ""Why, they only killed 6 million Jews."" Meanwhile, segregationists were pushing constitutional amendments to overturn the principle of ""one man, one vote,"" to give state judges power over the Supreme Court and to give states the power to amend the Constitution without any federal involvement. George Wallace and Ross Barnett led an effort to throw the 1964 presidential election into the House so that Dixie could determine the next president. Radical groups of all stripes wanted to use the March to make history. The Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan vowed to round up 10,000 or more white supremacists with the hope of inciting a conflict that would doom the civil rights cause. Segregationists in Congress even expressed hope that violence would ruin the march and the civil rights movement. Leftists, meanwhile, threatened to occupy the offices of segregationists on Capitol Hill and vent their anger at the White House and Justice Department. The Black Muslims denounced ""the Farce on Washington,"" and Malcolm X came to razz the marchers. And on the edges of the movement, Communists tried to work their way into the march. But amid what Garry Wills called America's second Civil War, the civil rights movement embraced the idea that the best way to gain rights was to appeal to everyone's hearts and meet ""physical force with soul force,"" as King put it. King himself did not always understand the imperative of love or nonviolence. As a young man, he later acknowledged, he hated whites. And he did not understand nonviolence right away either. In the early days of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, he hired men to guard his house with guns. By the time of the March, King understood that America could be changed only by winning over the other side. King understood that fighting violence with violence created only more violence. He knew that, whatever happened, blacks and whites needed to live together. One marcher who ""won"" a train ticket to the March on Washington for his courageous conduct in demonstrations, later remembered the time racist thugs threw beer mugs at marchers in Charleston. His first reaction, Harvey Jones told me, was to stiffen up to be ready for a fight. King planted himself in front of Jones. ""If you don't think you can respond nonviolently, maybe you should leave the march,"" King said. He calmed down. King's cause was moral, universal. He sought nothing for his people that other people did not enjoy. He wanted access to lunch counters and bus stations, the right to vote, equal access to schools, protection against mobs, fair police treatment. And King was willing -- and insisted that his followers be willing -- to suffer for the cause. Everyone remembers King's speech at the March for four words: ""I have a dream."" And, in fact, those words were transcendent. They conjured up images of a better world. Those words connected the ordinary struggles of the movement -- brutally hard work rewarded with beatings and jail -- with the glorious possibilities of equality. But even more important were four other words: ""Unearned suffering is redemptive."" King warned that even the most innocent and decent people would continue to suffer. Oppressors never yield power willingly. They fight back viciously. So buck up. Move ahead, first into the swinging batons and electric cattle prods and water cannons. Because there is no other way. King could issue that challenge. He could be that blunt and honest because of the universal values he espoused. They were not fighting for an earmark or a tax cut, loopholes from an EPA regulations, a Department of Education grant or a Fannie Mae subsidy. They were fighting for their lives. It all seems so clear now, but it wasn't back in 1963, not for most people anyway. But the existence of this massive movement, with hundreds of thousands of ordinary people willing to put their bodies on the line with nonviolence and even love, created real light in what could have been the darkest of times. Who's our King? Who is drawing on the power of soul force? Who is appealing to his bitterest enemies? Who today is pointing to a new age of cooperation and brotherhood? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Euchner.","People arriving for the Glenn Beck rally were greeted by a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.

Obama and Suu Kyi met briefly yesterday in Naypyitaw, but today they are expected to have a more in-depth discussion about the government's stalling reform and her unique role in progressing the transition to civilian rule. The beloved activist has been urging the US to step up its involvement and recently accused the US of being 'overly optimistic.' 'What significant reforms have been taken within the last 24 months?' she asked at a news conference last week. 'This is something the United States needs to think very seriously about as well.'

After the conference Michael Aung-Thwin, professor of Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii, said that it is not custom for women to kiss in public, which is why Suu Kyi may have shied away. He told the International Business Times: 'It is not at all the custom (in Burma, also known as Burma) as it is here in Hawaii, and (Suu Kyi's) backing away is almost instinctive for most Burmese women, even those brought up in or have lived a long time in the West.'

The President speaking this afternoon at the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative in Yangon . After talks with his counterpart Thein Sein late Thursday Obama expressed cautious optimism hope for the once-cloistered nation that balanced out earlier warnings on the risks of 'backsliding' on the transition. 'The democratic process in Burma is real,' Obama said. 'We recognise change is hard and you do not always move in a straight line but I'm optimistic.' During his two-night trip to Burma the US leader has also raised alarm over the direction of reforms, however, citing the cramping of freedom of expression, ongoing conflicts and the treatment of Burma's minority groups -- especially the Muslim Rohingya.

Obama was whisked from Yangon airport to tour the British colonial-era secretariat building in downtown Yangon where Suu Kyi's father, independence hero General Aung San, was gunned down by political rivals in 1947. On his last visit in 2012 Obama received a fanfare welcome from thrilled locals a year after Thein Sein began to open up the country.

For his part, Obama has been battered domestically with poor approval numbers compounded by a thumping defeat for his Democrats in last week's mid-term elections. He has invested a large amount of political capital in Burma's transition from military rule and hopes his second visit will boost the process as elections edge closer. His visit has coincided with the start of a debate on constitutional reform, in particular over the clauses effectively blocking a presidential bid by Suu Kyi and reserving 25 percent of seats for the military.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Washington state on Tuesday unsealed an indictment for airplane theft against an alleged teenage criminal known as ""the barefoot bandit."" According to the indictment, Colton Harris-Moore, 19, stole an aircraft last year in Idaho and flew it to Washington state, where authorities found it crashed. DNA evidence and fingerprints linked Harris-Moore to the plane theft, the indictment states. The elusive fugitive is suspected in previous thefts of small planes. In the most recent case, a small high-performance plane stolen from an Indiana airport over the weekend was found in shallow waters off an island in the Bahamas, officials said, and the details surrounding the incident have people wondering if the ""barefoot bandit"" was involved. Now, the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. An FBI statement indicated that agents believe Harris-Moore was involved in the Indiana theft, with the statement saying, ""Should you see  Harris-Moore in The Bahamas, please contact the nearest Royal Bahamas Police  Force Station."" After spending years on the run along the West Coast, Harris-Moore had surfaced in recent weeks in the Midwest, police said. Bruce Payton, director of Monroe County Airport in Bloomington, Indiana, told CNN a 2009 Cessna 400 Corvalis was reported missing on July 4. Payton said the plane was taken from a locked hanger inside an area surrounded by a 12-foot-tall barbed wire fence. ""We've never had an airplane stolen from this airport before, not to my knowledge,"" Payton told CNN, ""and I've been here since 1978."" He said the owner of the aircraft was contacted by the U.S. Coast Guard and was told that the emergency locator transmitter for the Cessna was sending out a beacon off the coast of an island in the Bahamas. Payton said the sheriff's department contacted him on June 30 and said a stolen vehicle had been recovered near the airport. ""The details associated with the stolen vehicle fit the M.O. of the person known as the barefoot bandit,"" he said the authorities told him. Harris-Moore was dubbed the barefoot bandit because he allegedly broke into homes in Oregon and Washington without shoes. Police suspect he may also have stolen boats and cars in addition to airplanes. Over the past month, the teen has been linked to a string of thefts and break-ins in South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, police said. Authorities said Harris-Moore may have broken into two airports: Chan Gurney in Yankton, South Dakota, and Karl Stefan Memorial in Norfolk, Nebraska. After authorities told him about the possible connection between the recovered stolen vehicle and the barefoot bandit, Payton said, ""I made several contacts with the state Indiana Aviation Association and asked them to put out a bulletin to all airports."" But he said any ""uncontrolled"" airport would be vulnerable to an airplane thief. ""We're a general aviation airport, a corporate-class general aviation airport,"" Payton said. ""Our air traffic control is not manned 24 hours per day. We have a controlled airspace from 6:30 in the morning until 9:30 p.m. Aircraft can still go from this area and operate under federal aviation rules as they do at all uncontrolled airports."" ""The bigger question people should be asking,"" Payton said, ""is how could an airplane fly from Bloomington, Indiana, and fly across states and airspaces and international waters and never be detected?"" Harris-Moore has become an outlaw hero to tens of thousands of people who have joined a Facebook tribute page. Jim Tillman, a retired pilot and aviation expert, said his alleged crime spree should not be romanticized. ""This kid is a punk. He's a brat who is breaking laws all over the place."" Tillman told CNN. ""You are dealing with a thief who is violating federal law and endangering anybody on the ground. There is no glamour in this, none whatsoever."" Tillman said that it ""wouldn't be too difficult for Harris-Moore to fly the plane to the Bahamas. Flying an airplane is not as tough to do as a lot of people would like to think it is, but it isn't like stealing a car. You've got an airplane moving over 200 knots, it's got a whole bunch of gasoline on board, it's just dangerous."" Tillman said many pilots are not required to file flight plans. ""As long as you don't fly in restricted areas, around airports, military institutions,"" he said. He also had a message for those who may idolize Harris-Moore for his alleged escapades. ""He's just an idiot pushing his luck"" said Tillman.","NEW: ""Barefoot bandit"" indicted for theft of a plane last year .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, presidential candidate Herman Cain made headlines when he said blacks were brainwashed for not considering conservative ideas. On other occasions he declared that racism was no longer a problem and blamed the poor for being poor. A personal friend, I know Cain to be more thoughtful than those incendiary sound bites, but I also suspect he knew that uttering them would help him land right where he is: atop the Republican presidential field, a standing that could be threatened by recent reports of sexual harassment allegations. Unfortunately, such trash talk -- popular among many black conservatives -- continues to alienate black Republicans from the African-American community. During the early '90s, when I was a member of The Atlanta Journal editorial board, I had high hopes that the black conservative movement -- to which I was a recent convert -- could help transform black America. I penned a number of columns urging the black community to put its vote in play so that Democrats would have to do something new to keep it and Republicans would be enticed to go after it. For me, the '90s was an exciting time for black conservatives. Having burst on the scene in the early '80s during the Reagan administration, they were everywhere. On the far right were free-market conservatives like economists Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams, along with establishment types such as Ward Connerly and Clarence Thomas. On the moderate side were professors like Glenn C. Loury, Shelby Steele and Stephen Carter. On the progressive side were voices like community grass-roots intellectual Robert Woodson and television host Tony Brown. Beyond those names, there were a number of other right-leaning black voices, from college campuses to the pulpit. Black conservatism was the most visible it had ever been since Booker T. Washington peddled self-help capitalism at the turn of the last century. But what excited me most was progressive black conservatism. Rooted in black nationalism and the self-help belief system of Malcolm X, it insisted that the black community be at the forefront of solving black problems. Far from being separatist or pessimistic, it was highly hopeful about America, recognizing that there was much more opportunity than there were obstacles. It was policy- and solutions-oriented, focusing on things like rebuilding the black family, black entrepreneurship, starting and supporting black businesses in poor neighborhoods, enterprise zones, housing vouchers, micro-lending, repealing Davis Bacon (a prevailing wage law that unfairly prevented unskilled, often black, workers from gaining apprenticeships on federally funded construction jobs), and starting Christian schools. It wasn't wholesale against social programs; it just wanted to duplicate the successes of those programs -- not necessarily government-led -- that actually worked. It didn't deny the existence of racism, but neither did it obsess over it, counting as more important those things over which blacks had control: persistence, hard work, academic exertion, and personal responsibility. But progressive black conservatism would never gain traction. Its lone supporter among white Republicans -- HUD Secretary Jack Kemp under George H. W. Bush -- who pushed a strong urban agenda, was ignored as his party pursued an aggressive suburban strategy that further alienated blacks. The tone of black conservatism became even more accommodationist, with progressive voices being drowned out, and never evolved beyond parroting long-held white conservative and neoconservative dogma. Today's crop of black conservatives is no different. In an environment of runaway corporate greed, where the top 1% is getting richer at the expense of the middle class, where rising college costs are making many students question the worth of a college education, where unemployment is hovering at 16% in the black community, where home values are drying up, and the economy is nearly on life support, black Republicans -- whose spiel is as one-dimensional as it was 20 years ago -- come off as even more tone-deaf. Their idea of reaching blacks is gimmicky. Just recently, RagingElephants.com launched ads in Austin, Texas, declaring, ""G.O.P. is the New Black"" and ""Martin Luther King, Jr. was a Republican."" An article written by Indiana tea party organizer Emery McClendon for Project 21, a national leadership network of black Republicans, says the tea party could appeal to more blacks if, among other things, it would show Sarah Palin and Dick Armey mingling with African-Americans. How laughable. Far from being rejected by a black community that is brainwashed, black conservatives have themselves to blame. They've appeared to care more about their own advancement and acceptance in the GOP than about truly helping blacks. That's a shame, because we still need a diversity of political ideas. If black conservatives really want to make black conservatism a serious force in the black community, they have to drop their ""just get over it"" philosophy about racism and its lingering effects, stand up to the GOP when it does something wrong, and come up with a real urban agenda. Take racism. Though I agree with them that it's not the No.1 problem blacks face today, there's no denying the fact that structural racism remains interwoven into the nation's criminal justice, educational and corporate cultures. All one has to do is read Michelle Alexander's excellent book , ""The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,"" or an insightful article by Jennifer Hochschild and Vesla Weaver, ""The Skin Color Paradox and the American Racial Order,"" in the December 2007 edition of Social Forces, to see the impact of racism in the criminal justice system and how darker-skinned blacks are relegated to overall lower socioeconomic status, more entanglements with the criminal justice system, and a reduced chance of holding elective office than their lighter-skinned counterparts. A 2003 University of Chicago study found that African-Americans with black-sounding names were less likely to get called back for job interviews. Ignoring such evidence robs black conservatives of credibility and moral authority. Telling blacks, some of whom are poor, desperate and penniless, to just pull ""yourselves up by your bootstraps"" -- while not at least acknowledging that historically, the boots were rigged, and in some cases they remain so -- is inauthentic and hypocritical. If black conservatives want to claim King, they should at least learn from him. During the civil rights movement, King said he couldn't in good conscience tell blacks to lay down their arms in the fight for freedom without speaking out against the Vietnam War. ""As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems,"" he said. ""I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through non-violent action; for they ask and write me, 'So what about Vietnam?' They ask if our nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without first having spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government."" King understood this simple fact: There is no moral authority in attacking the shortcomings of blacks while glossing over the sins of the larger society. Certainly, black conservatives are right to differ with black liberals about how racism impacts black advancement today. I understand what some of them are trying to do: get blacks to stop obsessing over what they can't control -- white people's hearts -- and focus on the things they can. Still, the argument rings hollow. I used to tell my son, ""A racist cop may pull you over because you're black, that's his fault; but if he finds drugs in the car, that's your fault."" Unlike some conservatives, I don't wish to let either party off the hook. As long as black conservatives appear to be attack dogs for the white establishment, they will always be a weak and ineffectual voice in the black community. Their views may win them a few elections, sell some books, and earn them the applause of their white counterparts, but it will remain a marginal movement that has no impact in the black community. Indeed, scarcely any blacks were excited when Michael Steele was elected chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2009 or when Rep. Allen West of Florida and Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina became the first two black Republicans to go to Congress since J.C. Watts of Oklahoma retired in 2003. And while we applaud the chutzpah of Cain and his amazing ability to have outperformed so many career politicians, it's his politics most blacks can't embrace. Bristling under recent reports that he had been the target of complaints of sexual harassment, Cain says he's being unfairly attacked, and I believe he is. The man I know has been married for 43 years and his character is unassailable. He's right that presidential politics places a big target on your back. I just wish black conservatives understood that being black in America does too.

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- They are coming from cities across China, including Beijing and Shanghai: . Students are leaving mainland China for the opportunity to study in Hong Kong instead. ""We are a small elite who can afford freedom beyond China's great firewall,"" says ""Li Cheng"" from Shanghai. Li, a student at the University of Hong Kong, did not want to disclose his real name or details about his study program, fearing consequences back home. ""I live in one country, but it feels like having two identities,"" Li said.  ""In Shanghai, I use special software to access sites blacklisted by the government, like Twitter or the uncensored version of Google. ""In Hong Kong, I am taught to integrate these tools in my research."" In the past, students such as Li would have to travel to far-away countries to get around Beijing's control of information. Now, they are taking advantage of Hong Kong's special administrative status that allows for a ""one country, two systems"" rule until 2047. Hong Kong is nothing like mainland China in terms of its free flow of information, freedom of speech and multiparty political system. Those differences were recently emphasized by Google's row with the Chinese government over censorship. In March, Google announced it was routing its users to an uncensored version of the internet search engine based in Hong Kong, amid speculation that Google would pull out of China entirely. China's reaction to Google's announcement . ""When Google redirected its site from China to Hong Kong, it meant a lot of publicity for our free harbor,"" said David Bandurski, a China analyst at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He studies censorship issues. ""[Google's] move has emphasized Hong Kong's significance in China, benefiting from the rule of law and its potential as a free information hub."" Many young Chinese have explored that hub since 1997 when the the British colony was handed over to China, paving the way for Chinese from the mainland to apply to universities in Hong Kong. The influx of students applying from the mainland created fierce competition to enter Hong Kong's top universities. The number of mainland Chinese applying for HKU's undergraduate program has increased more than tenfold in the past decade. In 2008, some 12,000 mainlanders applied for the 300 slots that HKU reserves for students from mainland China. Li Cheng said he considers himself very lucky to be studying in Hong Kong . ""Free access to information is a need and a privilege,"" he said. The influx of talent such as Li could signify a brain drain for mainland China, according to Bandurski. ""Without political reform, economic growth in China will decline,"" he said. ""Talents will leave China. Students and teachers who want to have more access to information are not dissidents anymore. They are becoming the mainstream."" Asia's top five universities are now located in Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan -- outstripping their rivals in mainland China -- according to a recent ranking of QS, a higher education information network company. The top mainland school was Peking University in Beijing in 12th place, down from its previous ranking of 10. See Asian university rankings . The data show that ""the tide has turned,"" according to Paul Denlinger, an internet consultant based in Hong Kong and Beijing. ""During the dotcom era [of the 1990s], head-hunters were looking for talent from universities in Shanghai and Beijing,"" Denlinger said. ""Now they are coming to Hong Kong."" With new freedom at hand, only a few fresh HKU graduates have returned to the mainland.  Last year, only 3 percent of HKU graduates from mainland China returned home to look for a job. That matches the trend of Chinese students studying overseas. More than 70 percent of the more than 1 million Chinese students abroad did not return home after graduation between 1978 and 2006, according to a report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences . Aware of this brain drain, the Chinese government has recently introduced a plan to attract highly qualified students back to the mainland promising better living standards, including favorable access to medical care. But that hasn't tempted Li Chang who, like many of his friends, wants to stay in Hong Kong. ""I love my country, but I don't want to give up on my right to access information,"" he said.","More students are leaving mainland China to study in Hong Kong universities .
Some say it's because of the government's restrictions to the internet .
Many who leave mainland China to study elsewhere never return .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Four years after the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, questions about the lingering physical and mental health toll of the disaster persist. The Fukushima District Court ruled Tuesday in favor of a family who filed a landmark lawsuit blaming Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant operator of the crippled nuclear reactor, for the suicide of a woman in 2011. Four months after three reactors melted down at the Fukushima plant following a devastating earthquake and tsunami, Hamako Watanabe and her husband lost their home, their jobs and the prospect of restoring their lives. She doused herself in kerosene and set herself on fire after slipping into depression. Her husband, Mikio Watanabe, found her charred body. ""We lost everything,"" her widower told CNN in 2012. ""We were forced to evacuate. We lost our jobs. I lost my wife in such a terrible way. I really lost everything."" The Fukushima District Court ordered TEPCO to pay 49 million yen ($471,063 U.S.) to her family, in a ruling that found a link between the nuclear accident and Watanabe's death. ""It is well assumed that the stress caused by sudden loss of the base of her life against her will and unknown future in evacuation was unbearable for her,"" according to the court ruling. A spokeswoman of TEPCO Mayumi Yoshida said: ""We express deep condolence for the loss for Mrs. Hamako Watanabe. We will examine the ruling closely and continue to deal with it sincerely."" Fukushima residents cleared to return . Thyroid cancer cases monitored . In the wake of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, the local government began monitoring the health of residents who were under the age of 18 at the time of the March, 2011 incident. The Fukushima Prefectural Government found more cases of thyroid cancer, with 57 people confirmed cases and 46 others listed as possible cases, according to data released this week. The risk of thyroid cancer increases in people who've been exposed to high doses of radiation. Children are more sensitive to radiation and at risk for a longer period of time than adults, according to medical literature on thyroid cancer. The cancer rate -- 57 out of 296,026 -- is high compared to known international statistics, but it's difficult to link the nuclear accident to the rates of pediatric thyroid cancer, according to the Fukushima prefecture's health office. The high rate may be attributed to the thorough method of testing for thyroid cancer, according to the office. Hisakatsu Kotani, from the Fukushima prefectural government's health research section, said there were no patterns detected between the cases of thyroid cancers and high radiation areas. ""Experts have been saying this is not the time yet to see any health impact by the accident,"" he said. In the case of Chernobyl, thyroid cancer cases in children reached a peak about 10 years after exposure, according to a report analyzing radiation exposure and the risk of pediatric thyroid cancers. A scientific review published in 2011, found that pediatric thyroid cancers only account for 0.5 to 3% of all types of cancers. That review also found that girls have four times higher frequency for pediatric thyroid cancer than boys. Of the 104 people who were diagnosed with potentially cancerous tumors at Fukushima, 68 were females and 36 were males. More than half of them, 58, had surgery to remove the growth.

"(CNN) -- Amy Bishop Anderson -- the professor accused of shooting six of her colleagues, killing three -- pleaded guilty to attempted murder charges on Tuesday and agreed to plead guilty to a capital murder charge in two weeks. Appearing in Madison County Circuit Court, Bishop Anderson accepted an agreement with the state and pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder. She also faces one count of capital murder. Bishop Anderson will plead guilty to the capital murder charge before a jury on September 24, according to CNN affiliate WAFF. Under Alabama law, juries are required in capital murder cases even when a plea agreement has been reached. According to the terms of the plea deal, Bishop could be sentenced to life in prison for each of the attempted murder charges. Police: Records on '86 shooting involving professor found . Prosecutors say Bishop Anderson, who taught at the University of Alabama-Huntsville, killed department head Gopi Podila and associate professors Maria Davis and Adriel Johnson during a biology department faculty meeting on February 12, 2010. Bishop Anderson, a Harvard-trained geneticist, had been denied tenure at the university a few weeks before the shootings. WAFF reported that prosecutors said Bishop Anderson's pleas on Tuesday confirm the facts of the shootings. The jury on September 24 will hear a shortened version of the case. A judge in March 2010 placed a gag order on attorneys and law enforcement personnel prohibiting them from talking to the media. Bishop Anderson also has been also charged in Massachusetts with the murder of her brother, Seth, in 1986. Her brother's shooting originally had been ruled an accident, but the case was reopened after the Alabama shootings.

"(CNN) -- In Texas, 33-year-old Marlise Munoz's body is being maintained with technology after being reportedly declared dead based on neurologic criteria, meaning her brain can no longer keep her body alive and functioning. Her husband said she wouldn't want to be kept alive by medical technology. But state law requires that her body be sustained because she is 19 weeks pregnant. The issues surrounding Munoz's case are not isolated. In California, 13-year-old Jahi McMath's body is also being maintained with technology. Her family wants to continue keeping her alive even though her doctors consider her legally dead. There are families all over the world who have faced similar wrenching decisions. For the medical community and families affected in these cases, thorny ethical issues remain unanswered. Conventional wisdom says that the patient has the right to make a decision, but when he or she is unable to, the legal surrogate decides. With Munoz, there are two lives at stake: hers and that of her unborn child. Some believe that the life of the mother is directly linked to the life of the infant. They are viewed as an inextricable unit; they live and die together. For others, the mother and fetus are viewed as separate beings with independent interests. As a nurse and clinical ethicist, I have witnessed firsthand the anguish of family members who must make a choice about continuing pregnancies under such uncertain circumstances, or the aggressiveness of treatment for their extremely premature infants. Generally, under conditions where there is great uncertainty about outcome for either the mother or the infant, we defer to the family to make an informed decision. Do Munoz's preferences become nullified because she is pregnant? Should Mr. Munoz's request that his wife be allowed to die in a way that is consistent with her wishes be disregarded? What is the ethical justification of mandating continued treatment that is contrary to the patient's and surrogate's wishes? Does the fetus become a ward of the state and the woman's body merely a biologic incubator for the fetus? Who then is responsible for the ongoing costs and care of the woman's body and the fetus should it be sustained to the point of viability (24 weeks)? Keep in mind that there are significant unknowns. How would the lack of oxygen or other treatments impact the developing fetus? Even if the fetus could be sustained to the point of viability, complications resulting from dependence on technology, severe disabilities or premature death are quite possible. Another ethical aspect of this tragic case is the impact on Munoz's medical personnel, who are providing treatments that are not desired by the patient or her surrogate, and who are perceived to sustain death rather than life. Clearly, the first priority of doctors, nurses and other clinicians is the well-being of their patients. Their mandate is: First, do no harm. They want to help patients and avoid or remove their suffering. Whose interests are they obliged to promote when they have a patient like Munoz? But medical personnel are not merely mindless robots who implement the decisions of others. They, too, have moral stakes in the process and outcomes of their care. In order for them to do their work with competence, respect and compassion, they must preserve their own sense of integrity. When doctors and nurses begin to view their actions as causing physical, emotional or spiritual harms to their patients, it causes them moral distress. They begin to wonder: How can I see myself as a good doctor or nurse when I am participating in actions that I perceive as wrong or ethically unjustified? The result is that clinicians can burn out. They become cynical, detached or numb. There are no easy answers. Cases like Marlise Munoz are always heartbreaking. There are many things that technology in medicine cannot cure or repair. We cannot know whether attempting to sustain her biologic function to support her pregnancy will yield a healthy infant. Using technology is always a double-edged sword; the very technology that creates hope can also create suffering. It is time to pause to examine again our ""technology default."" We must engage with our communities about the boundaries of using technology, and what the appropriate interventions are when a person's life is sustained with technology. Some would argue that the Texas law rightly protects the interests of the developing fetus and restricts the family's choices. Is the state a better guardian for the fetus than his or her biological parents? We should always have a reverence for life and the ending of life. If there is uncertainty about the degree of brain damage a person has suffered, then it is ethical to use medical technology to keep him or her alive until a better determination can been made. However, as in the case of Marlise Munoz, we must consider whether keeping her alive by invoking a state law honors her and her memory. We need to find ways to make decisions that are respectful, fair and promote integrity. We also need to accept the limits of what medicine can and cannot do. The time has come for a new paradigm for ethical practice in health care. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynda Rushton.","The husband of a pregnant brain dead woman asks she be taken off of life support .

"(CNN)  -- Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq killing four fellow Marines. He'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate, collateral damage from the explosion. Richard Strandlof says he didn't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran. Crowds ate up his story. He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians. Inspiring and seemingly authentic, he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol. It turns out the whole thing was a lie. He wasn't at the Pentagon. He was never a Marine. He never served his country. He never graduated from the Naval Academy. He claimed his name was Rick Duncan. He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance, and the FBI is now investigating whether he embezzled money as a result.  Watch Strandlof defend himself » . Where was he on 9/11, the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand? ""I was in San Jose, California, watching it in horror on TV with a few other people,"" Strandlof told CNN's Anderson Cooper. He was at a homeless shelter at the time. Strandlof denies being a pathological liar. He says he suffered from ""some severely underdiagnosed mental illness"" and that he got caught up in the moment around ""people who are passionate and loved what they did."" He told CNN he had put on a ""production, which I'm sorry for."" ""Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that, and I myself don't know what I can do short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives, to make that happen,"" Strandlof said. He said he's not sure exactly how he's hurt people. ""It's not for me to say, and time will tell,"" he said. Hal Bidlack, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, is one of those people. He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him. Bidlack isn't too happy. ""Once one lie fell apart, the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies,"" he said. Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11, 2001. He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story. ""Now that we know he's a lying fraud,"" Bidlack said, ""I think he was just parroting my own story back to me."" ""There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time."" Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military. He says it's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness. ""I don't buy that,"" Sterner said. ""What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself. I see this repeatedly. I've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof's. ... What they're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego."" Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases. He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity. ""Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did,"" he said. ""Because of Rick Strandlof, the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned."" According to the Denver Post, Strandlof came to authorities' attention first in 1997, when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad-check charges. With the FBI now investigating him for fraud, he told CNN he's innocent. ""We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects. I did not enrich myself on this. I did not gain any money from this,"" he said. That's not the point, said Sterner. ""The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility.""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A light-weight gun named after an Indian gang rape victim has triggered a wave of criticism from advocates who call it ""abhorrent."" Last week, an Indian state-run gunmaker introduced the .32-calibre revolver, made of titanium alloy, calling it a ""valuable contribution to women's security."" The 500-gram firearm is called Nirbheek, meaning fearless in Hindi. The name was ""inspired by Nirbhaya,"" said Abdul Hamied, the general manager of the Indian Ordnance Field Gun Factory. Nirbhaya is the name given by the Indian media to the 23-year-old woman who was raped and beaten by several men aboard a public bus on December 16, 2012. She later died. The brutal attack provoked outrage across India and led to calls for improved safety and treatment of women. Hamied said the project was conceived more than two years ago -- before the bus rape happened. ""It can serve as a deterrence,"" Hamied said. ""There's something you can do to prevent these attacks. You can also enthuse confidence among women."" The lightness of the revolver makes it more suitable for women, he said, adding that he expected male buyers as well. Since its introduction last week, the factory has sold just 10 of the Nirbheek weapons. Wrong message . Binalakshmi Nepram, founder of the Control Arms Foundation of India, described the new gun as ""an insult."" ""Women in India feel this gun is not going to help in security,"" she said. ""And we do not believe the gun is a solution to ending sexual violence."" She added that it sent the wrong message. Rather than prioritizing security for women, ""the government is introducing expensive weaponry to sit in handbags. It's an abhorrence to women,"" she said. The gun costs 122,000 rupees, (around $2,000), putting it above India's average annual per capita income, which is around $1,410. When asked what kind of the clientele Hamied was looking for the new handgun, he conceded it was likely unaffordable for those outside middle and upper income groups. ""It's not for poor women,"" he said. Owning guns . India also has strict controls on gun ownership, with licenses difficult to obtain. ""Gun licenses are given rarely -- only to those with money and clout, and that means overwhelmingly men. Poor women in India are unlikely to have the means or the access to own a gun,"" said Ruchira Gupta, a women's rights activist who is founder of Apne Aap Women Worldwide. Aside from the guns being out of reach for poor women, Gupta agreed it projected the wrong message. ""Nirbhaya was a victim of violence caused by a desire of six men to project their masculinity through domination. Ultimately we have to challenge the culture of domination and violence through nonviolence not through introducing more tools of violence,"" she said. So far, the gun factory in the northern Indian city of Kanpur has received 50 to 60 inquiries about the product, Hamied said. He didn't have a breakdown of how many of the gun's potential buyers were women. Madison Park wrote and reported in Hong Kong. Harmeet Shah Singh reported in New Delhi.","New gun for women in India raises criticisms .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett has been hospitalized in the latest stage of her battle against cancer, a producer working with the actress said Monday. Farrah Fawcett, shown here in 2004, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2006. ""She is not unconscious, she is not unresponsive, and she is not comatose,"" Craig Nevius told CNN. He added that Fawcett ""is surrounded by family and friends."" She ""has a real iron will"" and is ""a fighter,"" he said. Nevius has been working with the 62-year-old on a documentary about her fight with cancer. Earlier, he told People magazine that Fawcett had checked into ""a Los Angeles hospital."" Fawcett was diagnosed in 2006. People magazine reported that she has anal cancer. Early in 2007, Fawcett said she was told her cancer had gone into remission. Her official Web site has posts from February, 2007 celebrating the news. But the cancer returned later that year. Fawcett was a model best known for bit parts and commercials, and as ""Six Million Dollar Man"" actor Lee Majors' wife, when she shot a best-selling pinup poster in early 1976 at the behest of a Cleveland, Ohio, company called Pro Arts. Photographer Bruce McBroom placed Fawcett -- then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors -- in the Indian blanket-draped front seat of his 1937 Chevy and snapped away. The poster, with Fawcett's million-dollar smile front and center and right nipple obvious through the fabric of her red bathing suit, became a sensation. Soon after the photo shoot, Fawcett was asked to join the cast of a new Aaron Spelling TV show, ""Charlie's Angels,"" about a trio of female detectives who work for a mysterious man named Charlie. Fawcett, who played Jill Munroe, was the last to be cast -- co-star Kate Jackson was the known name at the time -- but, thanks to her poster, Fawcett became the series' breakout star. The highly rated TV series kicked off what came to be known as ""jiggle TV,"" series full of young actresses who appeared in bikinis at the drop of a hat. ""Denunciations of 'massage parlor television' and 'voyeurism' only brought more viewers to the screen, to see what the controversy was about,"" wrote Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh in their exhaustive reference, ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows."" ""Charlie's Angels"" turned out to be a huge hit, and shows ranging from the sitcom ""Three's Company"" to the drama ""Baywatch"" owe the show a debt. Fawcett didn't stay with ""Angels"" long. At the end of the first season, unhappy with her contract, she left the show, replaced by Cheryl Ladd. Fawcett's career stagnated for a time after ""Charlie's Angels,"" as she appeared in a handful of forgettable films and divorced Majors. But her career received a major boost with her starring role in ""The Burning Bed,"" a 1984 made-for-television movie co-starring Paul LeMat. In the film, Fawcett played an abused wife who sets fire to her husband's bed as he lies sleeping. Fawcett received an Emmy nomination for her performance. Around that time, Fawcett became romantically involved with actor Ryan O'Neal, with whom she had a son, Redmond, in 1985. Redmond O'Neal was arrested Sunday morning for narcotics possession. In recent years, Fawcett has appeared sporadically in the public eye. She posed nude for Playboy in 1995. In 1997, she appeared on ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" an interview that became notorious for Fawcett's apparent incoherence. She later said she was just having fun with Letterman. She reunited with her ""Charlie's Angels"" co-stars, Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, for an awards-show appearance in 2006. Fawcett has been making a documentary, ""A Wing and a Prayer,"" for NBC about her cancer battle. ""She is an icon, and you don't become an icon by being weak,"" Nevius said Monday. ""All you have to do is look back at her 30-year-plus career to see that she is not somebody that has ever stepped down or backed down from a challenge of any kind.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least six security personnel were killed and eight members of Sri Lanka's cricket team hurt -- including two with gunshot wounds -- in an attack Tuesday on the team's bus by gunmen in Lahore, Pakistan. A video grab shows a suspected gunman near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan, Tuesday. The Sri Lankan players were traveling to the city's Gaddafi Stadium for the third day of the second test match against Pakistan at around 9 a.m. local time (11 p.m. ET) when the attack occurred. Video footage showed several gunmen with automatic weapons opening firing on the convoy from a roundabout, Liberty Square, close to the stadium. Police said at least 12 gunmen were involved. Pakistani Information Minister Sherry Rahman told CNN the attackers were still at large. Witnesses described the scene as ""pandemonium."" Images showed police vehicles with their windscreens punctured by bullets and their front seats stained with blood. A body lies in the road in front of one bullet-shattered van. ""I heard two loud explosions outside the stadium and a lot of AK-47 fire,"" said Hamish Roberts, a cameraman who was inside the stadium at the time. See a map of where the attack took place » . The driver of the bus said a police car and two security vans at the front of the convoy had borne the brunt of the attack.  Watch footage of the gunmen staging their attack » . Up to eight players, one coach and 10 security staff were reported hurt, with two players suffering bullet wounds. Tharanga Paranavitana, 26, was hit in the chest while Thilan Samaraweera, 32, suffered a leg injury, according to Chamra Ranaveera, a Sri Lankan embassy attache. Both men are in a stable condition. Six more players -- team captain Sangakkara, Chaminda Vaas, Ajantha Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Thilan Thushara and Mahela Jayawardene -- and assistant coach Paul Fabrece were hurt by glass shrapnel.  Read profiles of the wounded players » . ""This is a very well-planned attack,"" security official Nadeem Sayed told CNN. ""The team is very much scared."" Cricket manager Charlie Austin, who represents six of the Sri Lankan squad, said none of the players' injuries were life-threatening. ""The guys are shocked. They are recovering at the moment,"" Austin told CNN. ""Thankfully they've only suffered minor injuries. They're keen to leave Pakistan and get back to their families as soon as possible."" Watch Austin describe the mood of the Sri Lankan players after the attack » . Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said the squad would be flown home to Colombo later Tuesday. Bogollagama is traveling to Pakistan for talks with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Sri Lankan officials have ruled out Tamil separatists, who have been waging a bloody civil war on the Southeast Asian island. Witnesses who saw the attack praised the response of security officials. ""The guards were brilliant. They weren't panicking. They were very calm,"" sports producer Gavin Scovell said. ""It must have been a terrifying experience, but they handled it well."" ""Our policemen rose to the occasion and laid down their lives to protect our Sri Lankan guests,"" said Pakistan's President Zardari. Pakistan, which is battling Islamist and Taliban insurgents in its North West Frontier Province, has struggled to attract visiting cricket teams in recent years because of security concerns. Watch how attack strikes at legitimacy of Pakistani government » . The current test series with Sri Lanka is the Pakistani team's first since touring India in 2007. In 2002 a car bomb exploded outside a hotel where the New Zealand cricket team was staying. Last year Australia canceled a proposed tour in the wake of a series of suicide bombings. The International Cricket Council was also forced to postpone the high-profile ICC Champions Trophy after five of the eight participants pulled out. Pakistan is due to co-host the Cricket World Cup in 2011 with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, although the extent of its involvement in that tournament now appears to be under scrutiny. John Stern, the editor of cricket magazine Wisden, said it was ""not possible"" to imagine international cricket taking place in Pakistan in the near future and described the outlook for the sport in the country as ""desperate."" ""Pakistan has been struggling for a while. They hadn't played a test match in the entirety of 2008,"" Stern told CNN. ""I do hope the cricket world will rally around Pakistan to find a way for the team to play outside of the country."" He said one possibility was for the team to play its matches in the UK, which has a large Pakistani community. Former Pakistani Waqar Younis bowler said: ""I don't see the International Cricket Council now allowing the World Cup matches in Pakistan. It's gone."" ""This has really damaged Pakistan,"" former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV. ""Already some teams didn't want to come to Pakistan. Now who will come after this incident?"" In a statement, ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said the attack was ""very upsetting for the wider cricket family."" ""We note with dismay and regret the events of this morning in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation,"" Lorgat said. ""I have confirmed with both member boards that the remainder of the tour has been canceled and we are working hard to get our match officials out of the area as safely and as quickly as possible."" Sri Lanka agreed in December to visit Pakistan after India called off a tour following November's terror attacks in Mumbai. Indian authorities blamed the attacks on Pakistan-based militants. Pakistan's Cricket Board had hoped Sri Lanka's tour would help it recoup some of more than $16 million it was set to lose as a result of India's cancelation. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to play in Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament after other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns over the country's civil war with Tamil separatists.","6 security staff dead, several Sri Lankan cricketers hurt in attack in Lahore .

"The State Department voiced concern Friday about the case of an American citizen in prison in Bahrain, whom a United Nations report alleges was tortured. Tagi al-Maidan was arrested in October 2012 on charges related to Shiite protests against the Sunni-led government for greater rights. He was sentenced a year later by a Bahraini court to 10 years in jail on charges of unlawful assembly, intent to kill police, destruction of police vehicles and possession of Molotov cocktails. The United States has said little about the case of al-Maidan, born in Connecticut to a Saudi father and a Bahraini mother, citing privacy laws. After his family produced a Privacy Act waiver, authorizing the United States government to talk about the case, the State Department finally said this week it had concerns about the fairness of al-Maidan's trial, as well as his ""safety and welfare, his treatment in prison, including his medical and nutritional needs."" ""This a case that we've taken very seriously,"" said Jeff Rathke, a State Department spokesman, indicating the government has raised this ""at the highest levels of the government of Bahrain."" The Bahraini government has denied the charges, insisting it has a ""zero tolerance"" policy on torture. A report by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention documents sources saying that al-Maidan was forced to make a false confession under torture that he assaulted a police officer by throwing a stone at him. With no physical evidence, the conviction was based on that confession, the report said, adding that ""Mr. al-Maidan and his mother were able to credibly testify that he was at home the time that the crime was allegedly committed."" The group called for al-Maidan's release. A representative of al-Maidan's family confirmed to CNN details in the U.N. report, including that al-Maidan says his confession was extracted by acts of torture, including beatings in the chest and head, forcing him to stand for long periods despite a spinal condition and denying him access to a bathroom. Since his conviction, al-Maidan has endured ""further abuse and mistreatment,"" according to the report and representatives of the al-Maidan family. The U.N. report said the government ""did not provide any explanation or justification for these serious violations. Rathke said U.S. consular officers have visited al-Maidan five times during his two-year detention and that in response to concerns, he has been given access to medical care. The case presents a dilemma for the United States, which insists there is no greater priority than the protection of American citizens. The tiny Gulf kingdom is a key American ally in an unstable region and home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. Most recently, Bahrain has taken part in airstrikes against ISIS as part of the U.S.-led coalition. Washington has tempered its concerns about Bahrain's human rights record and its heavy-handed crackdown on a popular uprising. Local and human rights groups charge many Shiite Bahraini youths have been arbitrarily arrested and jailed for alleged crimes against security forces. Calling al-Maidan's arrest and continued detention ""arbitrary,"" the U.N. working group referred the allegations of his alleged abuse to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and called on the Bahraini government to immediately release him and grant him compensation for the ""harm he has suffered."" The Bahraini court upheld the verdict on appeal, but al-Maidan's lawyers say they have filed for another appeal and are waiting for a hearing date. Rathke said the State Department expected the case to go to appeal, and in its discussions with the Bahraini government continues to address its concern over judicial proceedings in the case and ""emphasize the importance of Bahrain's commitment to fair trial guarantees required by international law."" ""This is a matter of ongoing concern,"" Rathke said.","Tagi al-Maidan has been jailed in Bahrain for more than two years .

"(CNN) -- The setup was bizarre. North Korean officials whisked a CNN team away in a van, purportedly to go meet with a high-ranking government official. Hours later, they arrived in the capital and were presented with three Americans held captive in the reclusive country. Like virtually everything in Pyongyang, the interviews were carefully managed by the regime. Each man had exactly five minutes to speak. Some of their statements seemed eerily similar. So what was the government's motive in letting Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle address the world? ""First of all, their motivation always behind these interviews has been to gather U.S. attention and then try to pave a way for high-level dialogue with Washington,"" said Ellen Kim of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. During their interviews Monday, all three men said they hope the U.S. government will send an envoy to help get them out of their situations -- similar to how former President Bill Clinton helped secure the release of two journalists in 2009. ""I do believe that (a) special envoy need to come in order to resolve the situation I am in right now,"" said Bae, who is serving 15 years at a labor camp after North Korea claimed he was part of a Christian plot to overthrow the regime. What might North Korea want in return? ""Their negotiating ploy with the U.S. is to try to get us to agree to nuclear arms control, to sort of accept them as a nuclear weapons state -- which we can't do,"" said Michael Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Another possibility: That North Korea wants sanctions against the regime lifted. Victor Cha, the North Korea adviser to former President George W. Bush, said the presentation of all three Americans at once could be telling. ""My guess is the fact that all three of them were put on tape for an American audience on Labor Day as a signal from the North Koreans that they're looking for some sort of package deal to try to get them all out,"" Cha said. ""Whether they're trying to connect this to the long-style nuclear negotiations is anybody's guess."" Washington responds . The detainees' surprise interviews with CNN's Will Ripley on Monday prompted renewed calls out of Washington for the men's release. ""Out of humanitarian concern for Jeffrey Fowle, Matthew Miller, and their families, we request the DPRK release them so they may return home,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, using the initials for North Korea's official name -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. She said the United States is in ""regular, close coordination"" with the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which acts as the ""protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea."" But it's apparent the three men are now being used by North Korea as ""bargaining chips,"" said Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has traveled to the isolated country. ""They're sending a signal, saying, 'We're ready to bargain for the three hostages,'"" Richardson said. What the detainees said . All three men said they have signed statements admitting their guilt. North Korean officials monitored and recorded all three interviews, and CNN was unable to assess independently the conditions under which the men were being held. Bae said he is working eight hours a day, six days a week at a labor camp, even though he said his health has ""been failing"" over the past 1Â½ months. The 46-year-old has diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney stones. Despite what he called ""hard labor,"" Bae said he has been treated ""as humanely as possible."" U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae, but to no avail. Even former basketball star Dennis Rodman, who has visited North Korea and called its ruler Kim Jong Un a ""friend for life,"" asked Kim to ""do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose."" Terri Chung, Bae's sister, told CNN on Monday the video of his interview was ""really difficult to watch."" ""It is clear from the video that he is under a lot of stress. And he talks about his health failing and being in complete isolation for almost two years. And it is devastating for our family to see that on TV."" She also released a statement asking the North Korean authorities to have mercy. ""It is in your power to release my brother. You could do it today. Please do so,"" Chung said. ""He has confessed to the crimes for which he has been charged, and he has served a longer detainment than any other American since the war."" Miller: 'My situation is very urgent' Dressed in a black turtleneck and often avoiding eye contact, Miller said he has admitted his guilt -- even though he won't learn of his charges until he goes to trial. ""But I will say that I prepared to violate the law of the DPRK before coming here,"" Miller told Ripley. The 24-year-old is accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry. He expressed frustration that ""there's been no movement from my government."" Miller said he wanted to tell the United States that ""my situation is very urgent, that very soon I am going to trial, and I would directly be sent to prison."" ""I think this interview is my final chance to push the American government into helping me,"" he said. Fowle describes 'desperate situation' Fowle, an American tourist accused of leaving a Bible in a hotel where he was staying, said he has ""no complaints"" about his treatment. ""It's been very good so far, and I hope and pray that it continues, while I'm here two more days or two more decades,"" the 56-year-old said. North Korea announced Fowle's detention in June, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" ""The charges are violations of DPRK law, which stems from me trying to leave a Bible,"" Fowle told Ripley. ""It's a covert act and a violation of tourists rules. I've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the DPRK."" Fowle said with his trial expected to begin within a month, he is getting desperate. ""You guys should convey my desperate situation,"" he said. ""I've got a wife and three elementary school-aged kids that depend on me for support."" CNN's Elise Labott, Barbara Starr and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","North Korea could try to use the detainees as leverage for nuclear talks .

"(CNN)Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh cut a swashbuckling pose in one military photo, with hands akimbo on his hips, exuding confidence. In another, the cleanshaven young man in uniform appears deadly serious, as one might expect from a fighter pilot whose airstrikes demand precision. Behind his military postures was a devout Muslim who memorized the Quran and hailed from a large family and prominent tribe noted for its loyalty to the monarchy. Al-Kasasbeh's fate had been a mystery since last December, when his aircraft crashed during a mission and he was reportedly captured by ISIS in Syria. That mystery ended Tuesday when video and images purportedly by ISIS show the pilot suffered a horrible death. Footage and images released by the Islamist militants depict the pilot in a cage, being burned alive. Jordanian state TV confirmed his death, but CNN could not immediately verify the authenticity of the tape. The pilot's father, Safi al-Kasasbeh, described his son as an unassuming Muslim. The father made those remarks well before his son's death was disclosed. At the time of the capture, Safi al-Kasasbeh told the Jordan Times that his son was ""a very modest and religious person,"" who memorized the Muslim holy book and ""was never harmful to anyone."" The 27-year-old pilot was a lieutenant, according to the Jordan Times, an English-language newspaper published daily in the kingdom. One of eight children, Moath al-Kasasbeh came from Karak governorate in Jordan and graduated from King Hussein Air College, the newspaper said. Prior to the announcement of his death, a message purportedly from ISIS had presented an ultimatum to Jordan: Bring convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset January 29 or the pilot will die. Tied to his fate was that of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto, whose apparent beheading was shown in a video released by ISIS militants over the weekend. Jordan had said it was ready to release al-Rishawi if al-Kasasbeh were to be released unharmed. Reeling with shock at how the pilot was murdered, Jordanian officials were said to be considering a military response to ISIS's claims. King Abdullah condemned the killing, and said that ""the brave pilot was killed in defense of his religion, his country and his (Islamic) nation."" ""It is the duty of the sons and daughters of Jordan to stand together and show the mettle of the Jordanian people in unity, determination and resolve,"" the King said. A Jordanian official said the pilot was actually killed a month ago, in early January. The purported immolation is a macabre closure to al-Kasasbeh's life. While he was still considered missing, the family's desperation grew as time passed and as al-Kasasbeh's fate was linked to that of Goto and the release of al-Rishawi. Goto appeared to hold a picture of the pilot, now bearded, in a video message purported to be from ISIS that was released in January. On the same day, Safi al-Kasasbeh joined hundreds of fellow Jordanians at a solidarity protest held in the capital, Amman, where he called on the Jordanian authorities to act to secure his son's release. ""I firmly ask whomever has sent Moath to fight outside the borders of Jordan, on a mission unrelated to us, to make strong efforts to bring back  Moath,"" he said. ""Moath's blood is precious. It's precious and it represents the blood of all Jordanians,"" he said. The plight of Moath al-Kasasbeh resonated with King Abdullah, who has been a pillar of the international effort against ISIS and is himself a former helicopter pilot. The young captive hailed from a high-ranking tribe considered especially loyal to the royal family. Abdullah's wife, Queen Rania, posted an image to her 400,000 Instagram followers shortly after meeting with the pilot's family. ""We are all Moath,"" it said in Arabic, beneath a picture representing a fighter jet in the colors of the Jordanian flag. From the start, Jordan has played a pivotal part in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, but it was not a popular war within Jordan, which only added to the pressure on the authorities to secure al-Kasasbeh's release. In late December, ISIS published in its English-language online magazine Dabiq what it claimed was an ""interview"" with the pilot. Al-Kasasbeh was shown wearing what appeared to be an orange jumpsuit. Asked whether he knew what ISIS would do with him, he replied: ""Yes. They will kill me."" The militants claimed they captured al-Kasasbeh after he ejected from the crashing of his F-16 on December 24. The pilot was part of the U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS' de-facto capital, Raqqa. Images provided by ISIS's media wing and circulated widely on social media showed bearded men with Kalashnikovs pulling the terrified airman out of a nearby river. ""We entered the region of Raqqa to sweep the area, then the striker jets entered to begin their attack,"" al-Kasasbeh said, according to the online publication. ""My plane was struck by a heat-seeking missile. I heard and felt its hit."" The Jordanian government and U.S. Central Command said the aircraft had crashed but adamantly stated ISIS had not shot it down, as the group claims. ""I checked the system display and it indicated that the engine was damaged and burning,"" the pilot was quoted as saying. ""The plane began to deviate from its normal flight path, so I ejected. I landed in the Furat River by parachute and the seat caught on some ground, keeping me fixed, until I was captured by soldiers of the Islamic State."" CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Becky Anderson, Jomana Karadsheh and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Images, footage released by ISIS show militants brutally killing pilot .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese car makers are grappling with sluggish demand at home and abroad as well as a strong yen. So perhaps it's not a big surprise that one corporate titan is now trying an age-old marketing ploy aimed at female drivers. Honda has released a new model of the Honda Fit, interestingly named ""She's."" Some of it might sound like an idea straight from the 1950s -- a car made for women -- complete with numerous pink features, as well as a windshield and air conditioning that claims to help a woman's sensitive skin. In fact, the idea of marketing a car to women was tried in the 1950s. Dodge's La Femme featured space for a woman's lipstick and purse. It too came in pink -- but faded fast, lasting only from 1955 to 1956. Back in 2000, Ford teamed up with Maytag, pitching a minivan complete with a washing machine and microwave. The ""soccer moms"" never put it to the test though, as the Windstar Solutions never cruised past the concept stage. ""She's"" sticking to a fairly predictable road with pink stitching in the seats, pink tweaks in the dashboard and a windshield that the company says blocks more ultraviolet rays. Honda also adds, the ""plasma cluster"" air conditioning helps prevent dry skin. (When we asked about the perhaps more grammatically correct 'Hers,' we were told that the former apparently sounded better.) If you don't care for pink, there's white or brown as well. And when we asked if a Honda executive really did tell a Japanese newspaper that the colors are meant to ""match a woman's eye shadow,"" we're told yes -- with no tinge of regret that some women might find such a comment offensive. We also posed the question to She's designer: Essentially, was she concerned about offending some women with such a product? We were told people have different tastes. And in Japan, there is also a strong culture of all things cute -- or ""kawaii."" They are not wrong. Kawaii is the one word we heard nearly every time we showed the car's brochure to women on the streets of Tokyo. But of course what is more crucial to any car's success are its sales. And when it comes to that, Honda without giving a precise number says so far ""She's"" exceeding their expectations.","Honda releases new model of Honda Fit: 'She's'

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday morning he has advised his family to avoid ""confined places"" such as aircraft, subways and classrooms because of the swine flu risk. Vice President Biden on Thursday said people should avoid ""confined spaces."" Biden made the remarks on NBC's ""Today Show,"" after he was asked what he would tell a family member about traveling to Mexico, where the first cases of the virus -- technically known as 2009 H1N1 -- were detected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, is advising people to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico, where the Mexican government suspects 159 deaths have resulted from the infection, most of them in or around Mexico City. Only a fraction of those cases have been confirmed. ""The CDC is concerned that continued travel by U.S. travelers to Mexico presents a serious risk for further outbreaks of swine flu in the United States,"" the agency says on its Web site. But Biden appeared to go a step further, saying, ""I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that you're going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me.  Watch the vice president explain why he wouldn't fly » . ""I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, (be) suggesting they ride the subway. ... So from my perspective, what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing, if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom it's a different thing."" Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, responded to Biden's comments by saying, ""Americans should heed the advice of medical experts when determining how best to manage health concerns during the ongoing swine flu outbreak. In a written statement, he noted that according to the CDC ""and countless other experts, swine flu should not discourage people from traveling to or within the United States."" ""Elected officials must strike a delicate balance of accurately and adequately informing citizens of health concerns without unduly discouraging travel and other important economic activity,"" he said. The Travel Association is a ""political liaison"" for the industry, and markets all modes of travel. Not long after the ""Today Show"" aired, Biden  released a statement through his spokeswoman, Elizabeth Alexander. ""The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico."" iReport.com: Share your swine flu concerns . ""If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week."" The statement also refers to advice President Obama gave to Americans on Wednesday night. He said they should take the same steps to avoid swine flu that one would take to prevent any other flu: keep hands washed, cover your mouth when you cough, stay home from work if you're sick, and keep sick children home from school.

"One year ago, Howard Dean, the former Democratic presidential contender and avatar of progressive sentiment, sat in a hotel lobby at the annual Netroots Nation conference in San Jose and held forth on Hillary Clinton's White House chances in 2016. Dean made news. Clinton ""will not get a pass"" in the 2016 Democratic primaries if she decides to run again, Dean said, an early warning shot from the left against the party establishment's anointed front-runner. Dean said he might make a repeat White House bid of his own, promising to agitate ""other politicians"" in the race on issues precious to liberals. Stepping up her game, Clinton agrees to help in midterms . How things have changed. Today, Dean still thinks Clinton will have a challenger in the Democratic field -- maybe several. But he won't be one of them. And if Clinton does run, Dean sounds like he's ready to join the team. ""I am a huge Hillary Clinton fan,"" Dean told CNN in an interview. ""I just am. Not because I hope to get a job. I know her; I've known her for a long time. I think she has an enormous mental capacity to do analysis and let the chips fall where they may."" ""If she is president, which I hope she is, I think she is going to be a terrific president,"" added Dean, who stopped into Clinton's book signing event in the Hamptons last weekend and posed for a picture with the former secretary of state. The kind words from Dean aren't quite an endorsement in the traditional campaign sense, but praise from one of the left's most recognizable figures is sure to please Clinton allies who are working to build up an aura of inevitability around her and blunt a serious primary challenge. The Ready for Hillary super PAC has already secured pseudo-endorsements from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Virginia's two senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. Opinion: Can Hillary Clinton win over the left? Clinton's incremental politics don't quite square with those of Dean, who rose to national prominence in 2004 as a fierce and noisy critic of the war in Iraq, a military action supported by Clinton. While Clinton is not the cold-blooded foreign policy hawk she's often caricatured as -- she's a devotee of so-called ""smart power"" and institution-building -- her Iraq war vote in 2002 and her occasional splits with President Barack Obama on Syria and Afghanistan have not endeared her to her party's anti-interventionist wing. Her differences with Obama resurfaced last week in an interview with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. Clinton drew a line between her own views and the President's cautious foreign policy realism, expressing concern over the administration's handling of the civil war in Syria. She said, ""Great nations need organizing principles -- and 'don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle."" The remark ricocheted around the Internet, and Clinton called the President to make amends. Dean, though, aggressively took Clinton's side. ""How can she not triangulate? She is running for President of the United States,"" the former Vermont governor said. ""You think if she comes out as a clone of anybody she has any chance at winning? People don't want clones as president. So of course she is going to say stuff that's different. So what? This is news?"" His aggressive defense of Clinton bloomed into a lengthy rant against the state of the political news media and the ""amplification chamber"" that Clinton will have to navigate if she decides to run. Clinton dances between loyalty and self-interest . ""I find all that to be worthless,"" Dean said. ""I don't pay any attention to that crap. I was at a meeting in Washington the other day with two very high-ranking people who I won't mention, and one turned to the other and said, 'Did you see that editorial in The Washington Post?' And without being cranky, and without saying anything, I said to myself, 'You're a free man.' Because why would anyone read The Washington Post, or certainly the editorial page of The Washington Post? ""I just don't have any patience for this sturm und drang that goes on in what passes for media these days.  I really don't read most of the stuff that's written about inside the Beltway kerfuffles like that because I think it's silly."" Clinton's biggest challenge will be generational, Dean said, echoing a previous observation he's made about the putative Democratic front-runner. Clinton is 14 years older than Obama and would be 69 on Inauguration Day 2017. ""Hillary, she has been on the scene since, what, 1992?"" he said. ""To elect Hillary, the country would have to do something we've only done once in my lifetime, with Reagan over Carter, which is the country would have to go back a generation. Usually, you don't go back."" Still, he said Clinton ""might be a great candidate because of that."" ""It's fairly likely the Republicans are going to nominate somebody who is going to be considered pretty flawed,"" he said, handicapping the GOP field. Gap shrinks between Hillary Clinton and Republicans . Dean called Ted Cruz and Rand Paul ""the wing-nut brothers."" Clinton, he said, would be a ""perfect foil"" for Paul, who is, in his words, ""a guy who wants to turn back the clock to the 1840s and all this other crap and pretend he is a libertarian but doesn't want women to exercise any rights over their own lives. She is going to mop the floor with him."" ""If it's Christie, people are going to look at Bridge-gate and Hoboken-gate and all that stuff and go, 'Why not join with a safe person who is a proven commodity?' 'Fuggedaboutit' is not a proven commodity. The only candidate that I would be concerned about is Jeb Bush, but then you get more of the same, and how is he going to denounce his brother's presidency?"" he said. As for the potential Democratic field, Dean said Clinton will not be ""an acclamation candidate"" and predicted that ""there's going to be opposition, and it's not going to be lightweight opposition."" He gushed over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who professes to have no interest in running, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who increasingly seems likely to jump in the race. Warren, he said, is ""new and refreshing"" and ""incredibly straightforward."" Dean said he is ""a big fan"" of O'Malley and said he would make a name for himself if he runs. ""I have spoken to him about this,"" Dean said. ""He came to see me about it a year ago. He is a very solid guy who has done a terrific job as governor. I like the way he thinks, and I like the way he approaches problems and gets things done. But Hillary Clinton has 100% name recognition and huge favorability numbers. It's a very uphill climb for somebody who wants to run against her."" Clinton, he said, ""is best prepared"" though he wants to ""see who her campaign team is"" before deciding if he will formally endorse her. ""I have not seen anything that alarms me about Hillary Clinton at all,"" he said. ""I actually thought the Diane Sawyer interview, minus the remark about 'We were broke when we left the White House,' was a great intro for her, because it showed her as her own person with the positives and the negatives. ""She could get elected without being her own person, but if she wants to get elected with real mandate, she has to be herself.""","""I am a huge Hillary Clinton fan,"" former Vermont governor and DNC chairman says .

"(CNN) -- The Oscars can be unpredictable, but one thing is for certain: Each year there will be at least one glaring oversight in the ""In Memoriam"" montage. At the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night, Andy Griffith and Larry Hagman were among the stars left out of the show's annual tribute to the Hollywood folks who passed away in the last year. With limited time during the 3Â½-hour telecast to commemorate everyone, the academy published a gallery online honoring more than 100 late stars, some of whom weren't included in the reel on the telecast. Griffith and Hagman both appear in the 114-slide photo gallery. However, ""Desperate Housewives"" actress Lupe Ontiveros, comedian Phyllis Diller, ""The Jeffersons"" star Sherman Hemsley and many more are not included. George Clooney covered the academy's bases while introducing the segment, saying, ""So for those friends who are on this list tonight, and many others who aren't, we thank you for the memories."" Soon after, Barbra Streisand took the stage to pay tribute to Oscar-winning composer Marvin Hamlisch by singing ""The Way We Were."" Who were you surprised to see omitted from the montage?

"(CNN) -- From cyberspace to college campuses, many young conservatives are worried that Sen. John McCain is not appealing to their generation. Sen. John McCain says he knows how important young voters are. At a town hall meeting in Ohio this month, a student told McCain that Republicans were a dying breed on his campus. ""I understand the challenge I have, and I understand that this election is really all about the people of your generation,"" McCain said. Many young Republicans said Sen. Barack Obama, the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois, is inspiring voters their age, but McCain, the 71-year-old Arizona senator who has been in office since the early '80s, is not. Eric Perlmutter, a Republican and student at the at the University of Southern California, said the roaring enthusiasm that follows Obama is missing among conservatives his age. ""We try to get people out to our college Republican meetings, but ... we can't seem to draw the same kind of vocal support,"" he said. At the July town hall meeting in Portsmouth, Ohio, McCain said he knows that he has ""a lot of work to do"" with the younger voters. The senator said he needs young conservatives to help spread his message for him, because ""there's nothing that convinces young people like other young people."" McCain also acknowledged the importance of using the Internet to reach out to a generation that stays in touch via social networking sites. On MySpace, Obama has more than 427,000 friends, compared with fewer than 60,000 for McCain. Perlmutter said he cringed when McCain admitted he doesn't use e-mail. Obama, however, is frequently seen with Blackberry in hand. Additionally, Perlmutter pointed out that the images used in McCain's campaign -- such as a message about small businesses showing a barber shop with a traditional red and blue pole -- hardly connect to the younger generation. ""Well, when you see the Main Street barber shop image, you think of 1950s America. An entrepreneur, a Silicon Valley guy would definitely make him more attractive,"" he said. Obama also has increased his college-age appeal by holding rallies and giving speeches at hundreds of campuses. McCain has said he recognizes that he needs to get out to those venues ""where young people are engaged and receiving their information and forming their opinions."" ""Sen. McCain should demand that these same colleges and universities host him or else their tax-exempt status could be in jeopardy,"" said Jason Mattera, spokesman for Young America's Foundation, a conservative outreach group. McCain must work to connect young voters to conservative principles, Mattera said. ""So if they are suspicious of Uncle Sam telling them what Internet sites they can view, they should be equally suspicious of the federal government telling them what health care plan they are going to be a part of,"" he said. According to a Pew Research Center study conducted between October and March, McCain has a big numbers gap to close. The study found that the current generation of young voters, those who came of age during the President Bush years, are giving the Democrats a wide edge. Fifty-eight percent of voters under 30 identified or leaned toward the Democratic Party, compared with 33 percent who said they identified or leaned toward the Republican Party. The McCain campaign said it plans to increase the senator's presence on sites such as Facebook and MySpace in addition to the candidate making appearance on shows that appeal to younger viewers, such as ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,"" ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" and the ""Late Show with David Letterman."" In past elections, both parties have tended to put less focus on younger voters because historically, their turnout has been low. With fewer than four months until the November election, McCain said he's confident he can convince young voters that he is the candidate for them. ""I believe that I can convince them that I have the plan of action and the ideals and the goals and the inspiration that, as next president of the United States, I can serve better their interests than my opponent,"" he said.","Young GOP voters say enthusiasm for Sen.

"(CNN) -- Bodies in the streets. Bloody faces pleading for help. Bandaged children in hospitals. The horrific scenes and pleas coming out of Syria mount as activists claim President Bashar al-Assad's regime has been ratcheting up attacks, which the government denies. What's behind the increase in violence, what effect did the Arab League monitors have and what may the future bring? CNN's Nic Robertson returned a few weeks ago from a rare look inside Syria, where the government has been placing restrictions on international journalists and refusing many of them entry at all. He explains what's happening in this Q&A transcript, edited for length and clarity. Q: What is happening in Syria and why is it seemingly getting worse? Robertson: (The violence) is significantly worse. It's become quantifiably worse since Bashar al-Assad unleashed the full force of his military army on Homs, on places like Zabadani that we visited with the Arab League monitors. When the monitors were there, the army wasn't shelling these towns. They weren't using tanks this way. They weren't firing mortars into these civilian areas. That's begun in the last week or so, all these injuries. And when we were there, there were perhaps 20 or 30 people being killed a day. Now the numbers are up in the hundreds. So it's quantifiably worse. Assad has decided to ratchet up the firepower, to crush this uprising once and for all to break their spirit, to seal these areas off so they can't get in, so that they can't get medical supplies in, so that they can't bring weapons in to support themselves. Q: Are these reports from people and what you saw on the ground about hundreds of people being killed, are they accurate? Robertson: We're not there and we can't verify the number of people that are being killed. What we see on the video that's sent out from there, that seems to be shot on cell phones, is maimed people. ... I've been in this business for a long time, and it's some of the worst I've seen. There was a young child with everything below his nose missing, caught by a shell, children that are killed. There's no doubt that there is shelling that is causing civilian casualties, that is damaging houses, that appears to be damaging hospitals, and we also understand, targeting the places where this video is being fed out of Homs. It is a siege in the medieval sense of the word. Q: Has it come to a crisis point, or are they close to a crisis point where all hell breaks loose? Robertson: Again, not being there, it's very hard to gauge. But when you listen to the desperation in people's voices, and you see the way that they're talking and the terms they're characterizing it in, yes, the situation is desperate. They say they're running out of medical supplies. Doctors are using secondhand sutures to stitch people up. They don't have anesthetics to give to people. When you have these kind of wounds coming in -- the survival rate is negligible. The young man who lost his face, he died for lack of treatment, nothing else -- for lack of treatment. Bread is in short supply. Basic food things are in short supply. What al-Assad is trying to do is crush the will of the rebels, of the opposition here, so that they will give up, so that they have no other option. He's also sort of trying to put the international community in a position whereby whatever the international community does through its desire to stop this (crisis), it will perhaps play into his hands, the idea of humanitarian envoys. Q: What about this notion that perhaps monitors on the ground or other people helping them out really plays into al-Assad's hands -- how so? Robertson: We've already seen it. The monitors were on the ground before, monitoring what was supposedly al-Assad pulling his troops and his heavy armor back. Their report at the end of a month said that he hadn't complied. These monitors don't have weapons. They have flak jackets, helmets and armored cars, some of them. They have no way of imposing their will, if you like, on Assad's forces. They can't stop them shooting. The notion that they could sort of get in between the opposition, these enclaves, and save them from the tank fire is a preposterous proposition. The only reason it would stop would be because Assad decided to tell his army to stop firing and stop shooting. And he appears to be nowhere near that kind of decision. ... If anyone thinks that Arab League monitors backed with some semblance of United Nations training can go in and stop the kind of artillery fire and gunfire that's going on, then think again. Because there were monitors there who wouldn't even cross police road checkpoints, never mind go into contested areas. There were some monitors who were willing to do that, but they're not set up and protected and equipped to go in and stop tanks firing and stop two forces shooting at each other. Q: So why are we even talking about this then? Robertson: One of the reasons we're talking about this is because al-Assad, backed by Russia, created a scenario on the ground where the West is watching huge, horrible humanitarian suffering. We're the ones that are saying: What can we do to help? How can we stop this? Russia and al-Assad would like nothing better than to see us divided, see the international community brought to a position where they will compromise for something less, i.e., not a removal of al-Assad, i.e., not going in with a military intervention. Maybe just protecting the people, saving the people. That's what they're aiming for in the short term right now. Q: You were recently in Damascus. How strong of support does the regime have in the capital city? Robertson: About 20 to 30% of the population supports al-Assad. There's 10% Alawite -- this is the sect that al-Assad is from -- (and) about 10% Christian. And the message that Assad sells his people is that, You're only going to be safe under me. The Sunni majority, if they get power, you will be forced out of your homes and businesses. Q: We saw what happened in Libya. Do you think that's ultimately going to happen in Syria? Robertson: We're a long way from that. Al-Assad still has 20 to 30% support of the population. They still buy his message that he is fighting terrorist groups who are backed by an international media conspiracy. He has the support of Russia right behind him. There's no strong U.N. resolution against him. And he is a smarter guy with a stronger army that hasn't given up on him yet. And the rebels there, the opposition, don't have what the Benghazi, the east of the country, a huge base where they can operate from. They have tiny little enclaves that we're seeing being shelled right now. Baba Amr and places like that. It's not that we haven't seen this type of thing before. If you think back to Bosnia, when Russia was supporting the Serbs there, politically, not militarily on the ground, there were tiny little enclaves, the infamous Srebrenica. The Serbs, after three years of standing back and shelling it, after the U.N. -- we're talking here about Arab League monitors, where the U.N. provided safety and security in Srebrenica -- the Serbs still went in and massacred 7,000 people. So what al-Assad and Russia are looking at here is a scenario where the international community could settle for something less, i.e., trying to protect these areas. And that will be no protection.","CNN's Nic Robertson recently returned from a rare look inside Syria .

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers scoured a widening swath of coastal Florida waters Wednesday for two people missing after a Mexico-based air ambulance crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Fort Lauderdale. Coast Guard crews earlier recovered the bodies of two other people aboard the aircraft, but rescuers continue to hope that missing crew members survived and are clinging to life in the warm south Florida waters. The search will go on at least all day Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. ""In these types of cases, we hope for the best and we search for as long as we can,"" Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss told reporters Wednesday. Coast Guard crews, divers from the Broward County Sheriff's Office and other rescuers were involved in the search, which spanned up to 24 miles of Florida coastline from Fort Lauderdale to Boynton Beach, Doss said. Currents are carrying the debris north, he said. The Learjet 35 -- carrying a doctor, nurse and two pilots, all of them Mexican citizens -- crashed shortly after one of the pilots reported apparent engine failure shortly after takeoff Tuesday evening from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The crew had just dropped a patient off at the airport and was returning to Mexico when the crash happened, airport spokesman Greg Meyer said. A distress call from one of the pilots came just moments after takeoff. ""We have an engine failure,"" the pilot said. Medical helicopter crashes after taking patient to hospital . An air traffic controller asked him to turn left and keep a certain altitude. ""Not possible,"" the pilot responded. ""We're going to do a 180, and we're going to land."" Seconds later, he said: ""Mayday, mayday, mayday."" Brian Rayner, an investigator for the NTSB said data indicated the plane climbed to about 2,000 feet before descending 1,000 feet. It then began to turn toward shore, Rayner said. He said that he had submitted requests for the plane's maintenance records and information about the pilots and their experience. The two medical staff members worked for Air Evac International, said Albert Carson, the company's director of operations. The pilots worked for a charter company. Authorities have not publicly identified the bodies pending notification of their families. ""We're waiting on pins and needles ... waiting for more information,"" Carson said late Tuesday night. Air Evac International has several bases in Mexican cities that are popular with tourists, as well as in Costa Rica and San Diego.

"(CNN) -- A group of friends got lucky when they bought a winning Powerball ticket at a Detroit-area porn shop. Mike Greer claimed the $128.6 million prize on Friday, on behalf of a group of southeastern Michigan residents that he dubbed ""Team Victory Club."" At a press conference in Lansing, Michigan, Greer wouldn't answer questions as to who purchased the ticket at Uptown Book Store in Highland Park, or why they were at the store in the first place. ""Nobody cares,"" said Greer. Uptown Book Store, an adult novelty store a few miles north of Detroit that also rents pornographic videos, will get $50,000 from lottery officials for selling the winning ticket. It shares a building with the Deja Vu strip club. At the same press conference, Steve Mays laid claim to a winning $141 million Mega Millions prize. Mays, who said he's been retired the past 10 years, said it was ""to be determined"" what he'd do with his jackpot. He opted for the annuity plan, spreading out his winnings over 26 years, according to CNN affiliate WILX. Team Victory Club, on the other hand, opted for a lump sum payout of $69.6 million before taxes. Greer said that the winners planned to give some of their money to an unnamed local church, ""and maybe fix some things around the house."" ""The prize is a blessing,"" said Greer, who did not divulge how many people would share the prize. ""We were in shock. Like I told my family, everything has changed, but nothing has changed."" Friday's dual announcement marked the largest single-day payout since the Michigan Lottery began 38 years ago, and the first time that a single state lottery has had Powerball and Mega Millions winners so close together, according to the Michigan Lottery.","A ticket that won a $128.6 million jackpot was purchased at a Michigan porn shop .

"Ukrainian special forces moved against pro-Russian demonstrators in the eastern city of Donetsk late Monday after the country's acting President vowed to resist efforts to ""dismember"" his country, his office reported. The troops cleared armed protesters from the headquarters of Ukrainian security services in Donetsk, one of three cities where pro-Moscow uprisings took place over the weekend, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov's office announced Monday night. There were no casualties in the operation, Victoria Sumar, deputy secretary of the National Defense and Security Council, told reporters. Police battled protesters in one of the other two cities, while authorities set up a committee to negotiate with a self-declared ""army"" in the third. The reports came several hours after Turchynov blamed ""separatist groups coordinated by Russian special services"" for the revolts, which he said echoed events leading to the Russian annexation of Crimea three weeks ago. ""Enemies of Ukraine are trying to play out the Crimean scenario, but we will not let this happen,"" Turchynov said in a televised message. Pro-Moscow protesters seized government buildings, raised Russian flags and declared new governments in Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkov on Sunday. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said the goal of the protesters was ""to destabilize"" Ukraine, allowing ""foreign troops to cross the border and seize the territory of the country."" ""We will not allow it,"" Yatsenyuk said. Russia, which has an estimated tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border, said it was ""watching closely"" and told Ukraine to quit blaming it for Ukrainian problems. President Vladimir Putin's government pushed Ukraine to set up a federal system in which regions with ethnic Russian majorities would have more autonomy, and its foreign ministry urged Ukraine to enter into talks over the issue. ""Ukrainian people want to get a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to listen to these legal claims,"" a Foreign Ministry statement read. The Ukrainian government was acting ""irresponsibly,"" it said. But in Washington, U.S. officials urged Russian President Vladimir Putin's government to disavow the protests and warned further Russian intervention in Ukraine would bring stiffer economic sanctions than those already imposed over the Crimean annexation. ""If Russia moves into eastern Ukraine, either overtly or covertly, this would be a very serious escalation,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. ""We call on President Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine. And we caution against further military intervention."" In Donetsk, demonstrators took over a regional administrative building in the mining city on Sunday. Russia's state-run ITAR-Tass news agency reported that a self-proclaimed legislature, representing what it called the Donetsk People's Republic, had called a May 11 referendum on whether the area should join Russia. The Russian news agency also said the Donetsk group asked Putin to send a ""temporary peacekeeping contingent."" The report could not immediately be independently verified. Protesters also seized the regional administrative building in Kharkov on Sunday. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who was in the city, said on his Facebook page Monday that the building had been cleared and that public employees had returned to work. But demonstrators returned Monday night to battle police, throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks and setting fire to barricades around the building, Ukrainian news outlets reported. Police used water cannon and pepper spray to disperse the protesters late Monday. But about 50 others stormed the headquarters of a local television station, while others attempted to seize its tower to air Russian television channels, the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform reported. And in Luhansk, where demonstrators had taken over the offices of the security services and seized weapons, the regional government set up a working group to defuse the standoff peacefully. The group includes ""authoritative public organizations and associations"" in the region, as well as conflict-resolution experts, the regional government announced. ""The working group is ready for an open dialogue in order to return the life to a peaceful course, to restore the public order and to ensure the safety of citizens,"" it said. Earlier, a group of armed, uniformed men in Luhansk declared themselves the ""Army of the Southeast"" and called on the population to turn out in support of ""our rights and values."" ""Within the last 24 hours, our army has increased many times,"" a spokesman for the group said in a video posted on YouTube. ""We are ready to send a reserve unit to Donetsk if needed. But without the total people's support, we will not be able to change anything."" Donetsk is the hometown of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose pro-Russian government was toppled in a popular revolt in February. Russia has called his removal a coup and dispatched thousands of troops to Crimea in support of a pro-Russian movement that seized power in that semi-autonomous Black Sea peninsula shortly after Yanukovych fled to Russia. That new Crimean administration held a referendum on independence that passed overwhelmingly, despite being condemned as unconstitutional by the new Ukrainian government and by Western powers. Within days, the territory was annexed by Russia. In mid-March, Yatsenyuk warned that demonstrations by what he called ""political tourists"" with foreign passports were under way in the east and warned that Russia might attempt to follow the model used to wrest Crimea from Ukraine. Ukrainian officials are still evacuating military installations in the territory, and Kiev's defense ministry reported that a Ukrainian naval officer was shot and killed by a Russian soldier on Sunday as the officer prepared to leave. Russia based its intervention in Crimea on allegations that the territory's Russian-speaking majority was being mistreated. Carney said the claim ""bore no resemblance to the actual truth at the time."" U.S. officials have said Russia had about 40,000 troops near the Ukrainian border. Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week that he'd ordered a withdrawal of some Russian troops from his country's border area with Ukraine, Merkel's office said. But NATO later said it saw no sign that Russia was pulling its forces back from the border. And a small number of additional Russian troops are believed to have moved toward Russia's border with Ukraine, essentially negating any previous withdrawal, two U.S. officials told CNN on Monday. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said the EU was monitoring the situation in eastern Ukraine closely with concern. ""We reiterate our call for de-escalation and the avoidance of further destabilization of Ukraine,"" she said.","Police, protesters battle in Kharkov .

"(CNN) -- Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo lifted martial law in the country's south, which she declared after the massacre of 57 people last month, Philippine news outlets reported Saturday. The order lifting martial law was due to be effective at 9 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) Saturday, the Philippines News Agency (PNA) and CNN affiliate ABS-CBN said. Military troops will remain in Maguindanao province to keep the peace despite the move, said Victor Ibrado, chief of staff of the Philippine armed forces, PNA said. Arroyo imposed martial law December 4 but lifted it Saturday after deciding it had achieved its objectives, Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita said, according to PNA. Local government was now back in power and the justice system was functioning again, he said. Authorities have said the November 23 massacre in Maguindanao province was a politically motivated attempt to keep an opponent of the politically powerful Ampatuan family from running for governor. Thirty journalists were among those killed. The martial law allowed arrests without warrants, and at least six members of the Ampatuan family -- including a local mayor -- were arrested, according to ABS-CBN. Authorities raided a warehouse and ranch belonging to the family last weekend and confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindanao command, told CNN. Ermita said Saturday that three charges of multiple murders were filed in court, and that 24 people were charged with rebellion. The Philippine National Police has referred nearly 900 other cases to the Department of Justice, he said. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","Reports: Order lifting martial law was due to be effective at 9 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Months after her father's prolonged campaign against President Obama's national security policies, Liz Cheney is spearheading a new organization aimed at organizing conservative opposition to the new administration's foreign policy approach. Liz Cheney formed Keep America Safe with William Kristol and Debra Burlingame. The new group, Keep America Safe, says its aim is to provide a cogent and organized rebuttal to a series of recent moves that expressly divert from the more muscular policies of the Bush administration. The group plans to tackle hot-button issues like the way forward in Iraq and Afghanistan, defense spending, CIA interrogation techniques, and the planned closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. ""We have watched with concern and dismay as the Obama administration has cut defense spending, wavered on the war in Afghanistan, and launched investigations into Americans serving on the front lines of the war on terror, while at the same time expanding legal protections for the terrorists that plot to attack this country,"" Cheney, along with the group's two other founders, wrote on its Web site. ""These policies, along with President Obama's abandonment of America's allies and attempts to appease our adversaries are weakening the nation."" Weekly Standard Editor William Kristol and Debra Burlingame, the sister of the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77 -- the flight that crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11 -- are also heading up the new effort. The new group says its goal is to focus media attention on continuing and emerging national security threats, and marshal grassroots opposition to the president's policies. ""Too often, significant events and thoughtful analysis in the war on terror are glossed over or ignored on nightly national newscasts,"" the group writes. ""Keep America Safe will highlight this information on our website and encourage dialogue between American citizens and their elected representatives in order to produce the legislative and executive action that will keep this country safe and strong. "" A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee responded forcefully to the creation of the new group, saying the Cheneys' foreign policy approach ""was deemed a failure."" ""Last fall, the American people overwhelmingly rejected a radical foreign policy authored by Dick Cheney that alienated our allies, emboldened our enemies, depleted our resources, distracted our focus and made the nation less secure,"" DNC Press Secretary Hari Sevugan said. ""The Cheneys can continue to focus on securing their sullied legacy if they want to. But, the president will continue to focus on securing the country."" Incorporated as a non-profit 501(c) 4, the organization is not subject to contribution limits, and is not required to disclose a list of its contributors to the Federal Elections Commission. However, it cannot engage in efforts directly aimed at influencing the outcome of an election. Kicking off a fund-raising drive Tuesday, Keep America Safe launched a one-minute, 30-second Web video that portrays Obama as a wavering politician whose ambitious foreign policy promises as a candidate have not matched his actions. ""Not enough time for a decision, but plenty of time for Letterman, golf, a beer summit, more golf, vacation, and a visit to Copenhagen,"" the video states. Cheney has been no stranger to the media spotlight since the Bush administration left office nine months ago. Regularly appearing on a series of cable news shows, the eldest daughter of former vice president has criticized Obama on a host of moves, once concluding that he has ""sid[ed] with the terrorists."" The former vice president has also been a vocal critic of Obama, declaring earlier this year that the president's decision to cease the CIA's practice of aggressive interrogation practices has left the country more vulnerable to a terrorist attack.","Keep America Safe says its goal is providing effective rebuttal to Obama .

"(CNN) -- The African Wildlife Foundation is hoping to do some tricky medicine on the world at large. It's trying to stop the planet's lungs from collapsing. ""If you think of the world as having two lungs, the Amazon rainforest is one lung, and the Congo Basin forest is the second. It's a place everyone should be concerned about in a time of climate change,"" says Patrick Bergin, the organization's CEO. The Congo Basin is also home to the bonobo, forest elephants and Congo peacocks -- species whose survival is dependent on that of the surrounding forest. Bergin has launched an innovative program to save the environment, not just the one region, but on the whole African continent -- the cradle of civilization and potentially its ecological safe keeper. Over the next decade, the African Wildlife Foundation is building 15 conservation-themed primary schools in some of Africa's most remote regions -- areas that are also highly strategic from an environmental standpoint. The schools are designed to be state-of-the-art, built with attractive faculty housing that will hopefully lure some of Africa's best teachers. In exchange, the organization not only helps to shape young minds to further the cause, but gets written agreement from the local community to set aside a patch of land for conservation purposes -- a stretch that will be free form hunting, logging and unplanned agriculture. ""It's a bargaining tool,"" admits Bergin. ""[These communities] are rich in land, but poor in cash. We brought in a resource to help build a school, and we barter."" Education in the Bush . Bergin notes that when it comes to education in Africa, resources go first to schools in the city, then to those in the surrounding towns. ""Kids that live in the Bush are likely to be deeply disadvantaged,"" he says. It is precisely that segment, he argues, that needs access to good schooling to protect the future of the continent. ""When children do not get access to a good education, they're doomed to a life where exploiting natural resources is the only way to make a livelihood. If you can't get a skill or a job that allows you to enter the modern economy, harvesting bush meat, cutting trees -- these are your only options,"" he says. Sustainable schooling . Construction has already begun on the first school in Ilima, an extremely isolated village in the Democratic Republic of Congo that sits on the corridor between two protected areas. ""We work in a lot of parts of Africa that are remote, but this takes the cake,"" says Bergin. Getting there involves a two-day motorized canoe trip from Kinshasa, followed by a five-hour motorcycle ride. What that means is that getting materials in and out of the area can prove troublesome. Architectural firm MASS Design Group has partnered with the African Wildlife Foundation to build the schools. For the Ilima project, it was imperative that the designers used materials that are easy to source and replace. ""If there's a need to repair or maintain the school 45 years down the road, the community has to be able to do it without depending on materials like steel or cement, which would be hard to locate,"" says Andrew Brose, the project manager. Mass Design started by researching not just the materials in the region, but local construction methods. ""We've found that when you go into remote regions like this, the things people build are already climate-intellegent. They know how to build with rainfall in mind,"" says Michael Murphy, CEO of Mass Design. ""We look at how we can adapt and learn from what's already done quite well in the area."" The school is built primarily from mud bricks and local hardwood. Brose's team tested different soils and palm oils in the region to find which combination of ingredients would yield the most durable bricks. Factoring in the rainforest climate, which is prone to heavy rains and high heat, the school walls only go up two-thirds of the way to allow for cross breeze. Rain catchments will store water for agricultural uses. ""This building is one of the most sustainable we've ever built,"" says Murphy. A portal to the 'modern economy' Like Bergin, Murphy views the schools project as a means to really impact the continent. ""Our ambition is to have more systemic change through a better building process. It's not just a one-off project,"" he admits. For starters, Mass Design has trained local craftsmen in its techniques as a way of passing on the baton. ""They could build tens of thousands of schools in the next decade,"" says Murphy. ""As the population booms significantly in Africa, there will be a massive demand for low-cost, rural school construction.""","The African Wildlife Foundation is building conservation schools in rural Africa .

"Phoenix (CNN) -- Alex Teves treasured Marvel and DC comics with their Spider-Man and Batman icons, and he was at his best in high school when he wrote about the superhero genre in English class. He revered the enduring themes of good versus evil, and he is remembered here, in the place where he grew into a man, as one of the good guys: a boy who inspired an ""Alex Teves Day"" at school, pursued a calling to heal both minds and bodies, and died at age 24 facing evil in the darkness of a crowded Colorado movie theater. ""If you want to describe Alex in one word, he was just good,"" says his father, Tom Teves. ""He wasn't a standout in anything, but he cared about people."" It is the goodness of humanity that Teves wants the world to know and remember: the virtues of his son -- and the 11 others killed at a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" in a cinema in Aurora, Colorado. That desire has taken shape as a crusade. In the midst of mourning his first born, Tom Teves has wrested purpose from his grief -- the Alex Teves Challenge, he calls it. He demands that the media stop naming and showing images of the gunmen in mass murders. Publicity glorifies killers, he says, and the notoriety spurs others to commit the same barbarities just for attention. Columbine. Virginia Tech. Tucson. And now Aurora. Alex Teves had just completed his master's degree in psychological counseling. His father says he would have condemned the practice of focusing on the murderers. Remember the victims, the heroic acts, Tom Teves exhorts. Let good triumph over evil. 'A zest for life' Alex Teves died shielding his girlfriend from the rain of bullets. His last act was more than just heroism. It attested to his nature to help humankind. Opinion: They lost their lives, upheld the code . Fresh out of the University of Denver with his master's degree, he was readying to seek another degree, a bachelor's in physical therapy at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He chose this long path because he wanted to heal the whole person, his family says. Tom Teves is deeply satisfied that the oldest of the couple's three children, all sons, came to know himself so well. ""He told me one day, 'I'm not going to do what you do -- because it's business,'"" says Teves, an executive for a corporate services firm. Alex said he didn't have it in him to order people around. ""And it was my proudest moment. He knew what he wanted to do,"" the father adds. Alex's mother, Caren, recalls his ever-present smile and appetite for life. ""He loved food. He loved to travel. He loved to explore new things. He just had a zest for life. He just wanted to experience everything he could. ""I'm glad he did as much as he could in the time he had here."" He met his girlfriend in graduate school, and Alex planned to marry her once he finished his studies, the mother says. Tales of heroism in Aurora . In the elegantly designed Phoenix community of Ahwatukee, where the boulevards are desert-landscaped with saguaro cacti and palo verde trees, Alex was such an ordinary guy of irrepressible cheer that he was celebrated for it by his classmates at Desert Vista High School, a high-performing public school opened in 1996 that sends graduates to the Ivy League. Every day, he wore a crisp, white T-shirt, blue jeans and loafers to school; he just wasn't into materialism and liked to think of the more important things, his mother said. By his senior year, his AP statistics classmates -- and then the entire class of 2006 -- decided to hold a day in his honor. Everyone came to school dressed like him. And now, says his mother, friends and supporters of those slain in the movie theater massacre held a memorial service in Denver with an Alex Teves dress code, and friends in Hawaii told the family they were planning a similarly attired service. Alex Teves was a cooperative student with a streak for being fun and funny, says high school math instructor Francoise Dastous, who teaches the statistics class. ""He really didn't have a clique per se. He got along well with everybody, and everybody wanted to be friends with him."" Alex once recounted to the class a hiking adventure that went awry, Dastous says. For anyone else, the experience would have been horrific, ""but Alex put a positive spin on it,"" Dastous says. ""He was just really engaging and really fun to listen to."" Six years have passed since the 57-year-old teacher had Alex in class, but the memories are clear. ""He just really kind of stood out from the other kids. He was always smiling."" Alex was an honors student whom other faculty recalled as having a sense of humor, says Anna Battle, principal of the 3,000-student school, one of the largest in Arizona. ""He wasn't Mr. Flamboyant. He wasn't Mr. Social Anybody. He was an even-keeled, pleasant, quality young man who loved superheroes,"" Battle says. ""One English teacher said he was a good writer and wrote exceptionally about superheroes. ""Unfortunately, it sounds like the young man who created this incident (in the Colorado movie theater) had some challenges that Alex may have been able to help,"" Battle adds. The alleged gunman is also 24 and was a neuroscience doctoral student at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. According to a court document filed by his public defense attorneys, he was also a patient of a university psychiatrist. 'My hero every day' Alex Teves will not be forgotten. His father shares one more memory. Alex was injured with a group of kids when their car rolled over in an accident in the desert. He was a student at the University of Arizona at the time. When an ambulance arrived, Alex insisted the other passengers get inside first, his father recalls, even though he needed immediate treatment, too. Once in intensive care, Alex asked his father to visit one of his friends who was hospitalized because that boy's parents had yet to arrive. ""That's the kind of kid he was,"" the father says. ""The world is worse off because he's not in it."" 4 Colorado shooting victims remembered for vitality, selflessness . That the suspect had dyed his hair red to resemble the villain Joker of the Batman series is a cruel turn of fate that enrages the grieving father. Tom Teves doesn't want his son's legacy to be defined by a gunman. When the man first appeared in court last week in Colorado, Teves was there. He calls the suspect ""a coward."" ""He didn't look like much,"" Teves says. ""My son could have wiped the floor with him."" Then the father continues: ""If he would have known my son, he would have helped him."" He returns to his challenge to the media. He blames news outlets, including CNN, for playing a role in perpetuating mass shootings. ""You make him out to be a madman,"" he says of the man suspected of killing his son. ""He knew he was going to be on television. These guys are playing you like fiddles. Either you're not that bright -- I used a better word than I was thinking of -- or you don't care and you're using it to sell advertising, and then you're the worst thing on the face of the earth."" Tom and Caren Teves have been married 28 years. He worked two or three jobs sometimes, so that their kids could benefit from having their mother at home full-time. Now the couple faces raising their 16- and 17-year-old sons without their big brother. ""He was my hero every day,"" Teves says. The father isn't surprised by the way Alex responded when savagery slipped inside the movie theater. ""Alex is in heaven,"" he adds. ""I'm quite sure of it."" His anger subsides. The couple is accompanied by Caren Teves' sister and her husband, whom the Teveses earlier picked up at the Phoenix airport. The in-laws, Joe and Carla Morgan, express outrage that the suspect's photo appears five times on the front page of a national newspaper, overwhelming any photos of Alex and the others who lost their lives. ""Stop showing cowards and start showing heroes,"" Tom Teves says, ""so that another father doesn't feel the hole in his body that I have and I know will never go away."" He puts his hand over his heart. His wife extends her hand and joins his. ""It's got to end,"" he says. ""You do your part, and I promise to do the other."" He says he will spend his days reminding the media of this challenge in his son's name. Remembering Rebecca Wingo, Aurora victim . How to help the victims of the Colorado massacre .

"A Sudanese woman who was recently spared the death penalty for converting to Christianity said she fears the baby she gave birth to while in chains may not be able to walk properly. Mariam Yahya Ibrahim, 27, gave birth to daughter Maya with her legs shackled and now doctors say she may need support to walk when she’s older. Ibrahim, who was freed after an international outcry, said that ‘something has happened to the baby’. Fears: Mariam Yahya Ibrahim says the baby she gave birth to in prison in Sudan may never walk properly. Pictured on the left is her 18-month-old boy Martin . She told CNN: ‘I was really scared of giving birth in prison. I gave birth chained. Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn’t open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table. I wasn’t lying on the table. ‘Something has happened to the baby. I don’t know in the future whether she’ll need support to walk or not.’ Sudanese authorities and U.S. officials in Khartoum are currently negotiating to allow Ibrahim to leave Sudan. She was detained at Khartoum airport last week, one day after an appeals court overturned a death sentence imposed on her for having converted from Islam to Christianity in order to marry her Christian American husband, Daniel Wani. Her lawyer Mohaned Mostafa said Ibrahim, her husband and two children had all been staying at the U.S. embassy in Khartoum since her release, which was granted on the condition that Ibrahim remains in Sudan. Severe treatment: Ibrahim was on death row for marrying a Christian and refusing to convert back to Islam . 'There are talks going on currently between Sudanese and American officials to try to find a way for Mariam and her family to leave the country,' a source close to the case said, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Ibrahim was detained on last Tuesday for trying to use documents issued by the embassy of South Sudan to fly out of Khartoum with her American-South Sudanese husband and their two children. Despite lifting her death sentence after huge international pressure, Sudan still does not acknowledge Ibrahim's new identity as a Christian South Sudanese because it does not recognise her marriage. Muslim women are not permitted to marry Christian men under the Islamic laws that Sudan applies. 'The talks now are aiming to get her out of Sudan on a Sudanese passport,' the source said. Ibrahim's husband Daniel Wani told Reuters that it was a 'misunderstanding' and error when Sudanese authorities said her travel documents were invalid, adding that his wife should have the right to adopt his South Sudanese nationality. 'There is diplomatic work going on and the Sudanese government offers help and cooperates in this matter,' Wani said in a phone conversation with Reuters. 'We will leave this time in a smooth manner and with travel documents that the Sudanese authorities accept.' South Sudan, which has a majority Christian population, became independent from the mostly Muslim north after a referendum in 2011 that ended years of civil war. Loving couple: Ibrahim and her husband, American citizen Daniel Wani, were both detained at Khartoum airport last week, along with their children, as they tried to leave for the US . Ibrahim's case has been closely monitored by Washington and London, which last month summoned the Sudanese charge d'affaires to protest against Ibrahim's initial death sentence and urged Sudan to uphold its international obligations on freedom of religion and belief. A U.S. spokeswoman said on Thursday before Ibrahim's release that Ibrahim had all the documents she needed to travel to the United States. The United States has imposed economic sanctions on Sudan since 1997 over alleged human rights violations. It intensified sanctions in 2006 over Khartoum's actions in its conflict with rebels in the western region of Darfur. Ms Ibrahim, born in eastern Sudan's Gedaref state on November 3, 1987, is the daughter of a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian mother, according to a statement from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum obtained by AFP. Her father abandoned the family when she was five, and she was raised according to her mother's faith, it says. 'She has never been a Muslim in her life,' said the statement signed by Father Mussa Timothy Kacho, episcopal vicar for Khartoum. Miss Ibrahim joined the Catholic church shortly before she married Mr Wani in December 2011, the vicar said. Mr Wani was born in Khartoum but is now a U.S. citizen, the U.S. embassy confirmed to AFP last Tuesday. The case against Ms Ibrahim dates from 2013 when 'a group of men who claim to be Mariam's relatives' filed an initial legal action, the vicar's statement said. In fact, she had never seen those men before, the statement added, in comments confirmed by her lawyer, Mohanad Mustafa. Ms Ibrahim, who is a trained doctor, and her husband own a barber shop, a mini-mart and an agricultural project in Gedaref, the vicar said. Mr Mustafa did not know if there is a link between the businesses and the case against Ms Ibrahim, but he told AFP: 'Surely there is something behind this'. Sudan introduced Islamic Shariah law in the early 1980s under the rule of autocrat Jaafar Nimeiri, contributing to the resumption of an insurgency in the mostly animist and Christian south of Sudan. The south seceded in 2011 to become the world's newest nation, South Sudan. Sudanese President Omar Bashir, an Islamist who seized power in a 1989 military coup, has said his country will implement Islam more strictly now that the non-Muslim south is gone. A number of Sudanese have been convicted of apostasy in recent years, but they all escaped execution by recanting their new faith.","Sudanese mum Mariam Ibrahim was sentenced to death for being Christian .

"San Diego (CNN)On the threshold of the 2016 election, the GOP is in a terrible fix over immigration. They've done such an effective job of alienating Hispanics over the years with their overall approach to immigration. Fences need to be mended. At least that's the views of Republicans who understand changing demographics and realize the folly of antagonizing a population that produces more than 2 million potential voters every four years and maintains a sizable presence in three battleground states: Nevada, Florida and Colorado. And yet, in politics, the first rule is that elected officials should always remember to take care of their base -- elements of which, for the GOP, frown on attempts by Republican politicians to engage in ""Hispandering"" by reaching out to Hispanic voters and softening their tone on immigration. It's mostly about jealously and resentment over seeing elected officials who used to woo them going off to woo somewhere else. Nonetheless, going forward, Republicans aren't sure what to do, and this indecision stems from three things. First, it is an article of faith among Republicans -- particularly those in the House of Representatives -- that the voters who turned out in November and put the GOP back in control of both houses of Congress want them to derail what the right-wing inaccurately describes as Obama's ""executive amnesty."" That's what House Republicans attempted to do recently when they used amendments to a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security to cut off funding for the administration's plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. The tactic divides Republicans and sets up a confrontation with GOP Senate colleagues, who are expected to scuttle the measure. It's also a largely symbolic effort that will, in the end, not amount to much besides giving House Republicans something to point to down the road, when they go home to their districts. They're probably counting on the fact that, while some of their constituents will be angry that Obama's executive action survived, others will give conservative lawmakers an ""A"" for effort. Second, the Republican establishment and other moderates -- both in Washington and at the state level -- are determined to win back Hispanic support and not further antagonize or alienate those voters, unless the GOP wants to turn up DOA in the next several presidential elections. Republicans don't have to turn themselves inside out, but they need to deal with immigration with more honesty, nuance and common sense. They should stop attacking immigrants because they're frustrated by the government's response to illegal immigration. And they should pick on people their own size by going after employers. Finally, they need to adopt a zero tolerance policy the next time a Republican official says something racist or nativist. Too many Republicans are cowards when it comes to acknowledging the role that ethnicity plays in the current anxiety that many Americans feel about managing immigration and securing the borders. And third, according to polls, nearly 90% of Hispanic voters support Obama's executive action and about 80% of Hispanic voters say the GOP should not interfere with it, which sets up the possibility that Hispanics will punish Republicans if they continue to try to dismantle the policy. This doesn't mean that all or even most Hispanics want open borders. It's hard to make that argument given that, at the moment, most Border Patrol agents are Hispanic. But what I hear from Hispanics is that while they're fed up with how both parties play politics with the immigration issue, they're really furious at Republicans for that party's efforts to demagogue this issue in order to scare up votes from white people. Hispanics say they want employers punished and not just the immigrants who can't defend themselves. And they tell me despite Republicans denying that race and ethnicity are factors in the debate, they don't believe for one minute that Americans would be this shook up if the majority of illegal immigrants were coming from Canada, Sweden or Great Britain instead of Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala. So how do Republicans placate those right-wing elements of their base and undo Obama's executive action on immigration without further enraging Hispanics? It won't be easy. Payback can be brutal. And while some political parties never learn, Hispanics never forget. Republicans could stubbornly decide that they don't need Hispanic support in 2016 and beyond, and so they don't have to worry about alienating them. Or they could roll the dice and count on the assumption that -- despite what the polls say -- not all Hispanics support Obama's executive action because they oppose illegal immigration as much as other Americans. For now, Republicans seem to be going down a third road and simply ignoring the practical impact that their attempted rollback of Obama's executive action would have on the millions of illegal immigrants who -- if the GOP were successful -- would suddenly be, once again, eligible for deportation. Republicans don't want those people to be the focus of this discussion, and they'd prefer the attention to be on the validity of executive action itself. That is where they're shifting the conversation. That's a weak attempt to dodge the issue. Hispanics are closer to this issue than other Americans because more of them have first-hand contact with illegal immigrants. They know this debate isn't some abstract discussion of competing priorities. They know it's about people and detached politicians deciding who stays and who goes. That sounds like a fun game. Well, next year, Hispanics will get to play. They'll help decide which elected officials stay in office and which ones go home for good.","On the threshold of the 2016 election, the GOP is in a terrible fix over immigration .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Sean Cononie bounded out of the back of an ambulance ahead of most of the other volunteers. A bullhorn in his hand, he was, in a sense, the pied piper. ""If there's anybody out here, that wants the swine flu vaccine, please come over here,"" he said. And come they did. Outside Fort Lauderdale's main library, a crowd started to build, and soon about a dozen homeless people were rolling up their shirt sleeves -- in the middle of the street -- for the H1N1 vaccination. ""You stop spreading the germs,"" Cononie said. ""Because if a homeless person gets positive for the swine flu, they get sick, they go into a gas station and use the bathroom, transfer those germs to a public bathroom, [then] mom and dad come in with little ones, use that bathroom -- boom. Bingo. Contagious. Swine flu."" The volunteers are with the Homeless Voice -- a nonprofit homeless advocacy center that also runs a shelter in Hollywood, Florida. They've hit the streets for about three weeks to vaccinate the homeless population in Broward County. They requested the vaccine through the Florida Department of Health to help part of a population that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls an at risk group. Many homeless people often have untreated medical conditions, and the lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for them to catch the virus. So far, the group has vaccinated about 300 homeless people . ""Some have high blood pressure, some are alcoholics and are more susceptible to the flu, the seasonal flu, and the swine flu,"" said Dr. Chad Frank, a family practice physician who is a volunteer. ""We're protecting them, and we're also saving the emergency rooms here as well from being overloaded with potential patients, swine flu patients."" Wearing a yellow reflective T-shirt, Frank spends his nights on the street during the vaccination effort. ""I think it's needed,"" he said. ""And believe it or not, it's fun. That's why I'm a doctor."" Russell Ahamed was one of the first people in line. He lives in the park next to the library in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The volunteers took his temperature to make sure he wasn't running a fever and took his name down so he could be entered into a Department of Health database. ""I appreciate this. There's not a whole lot of people that come by and do something like this,"" Ahamed said. ""I know people can die from [the flu]."" But on this night, not everyone was able to get the shot. William -- the only name he gave to volunteers -- was ready and willing but not able. Alcohol had gotten the best of him, and he could no longer stand. Fearing a possible bad reaction to the vaccine, the volunteers would not give it to him. Calmly, Cononie leaned down to talk to William, who was sitting on the grass, and explained why they couldn't vaccinate him then. ""William, I'm gonna put something in your bag. It's a piece of paper,"" Cononie said. ""When you wake up in the morning, promise me you're going to look for this piece of paper, OK? It says our phone number. Call us in the morning. We'll come back and give you a shot when you're a little more sober."" William insisted, ""I need the shot now."" Cononie replied, ""Well, we don't think tonight's a good night because you have a lot of alcohol in you."" The volunteers, who travel with a police escort in case they encounter any situation they're not equipped to handle, described the homeless as a forgotten population. Lee Engels is newly homeless. He lost his trailer and his construction job in Martin County, Florida, and headed south to Fort Lauderdale, he said. He's been homeless for three weeks, and he's trying to stay sober. ""It's tough out here, but it's how you make it,"" Engels said, rolling up his sleeve to get the vaccine injection. The volunteers said there's no way to know how much of an effect they are having in stopping the spread of H1N1, but they believe they are doing a public service. ""A true blessing,"" Engels agreed. ""You don't have to go to a hospital and pay the bill.""","Volunteers hit streets to offer H1N1 vaccine to homeless in Broward County, Florida .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of flights were delayed at India's New Delhi airport Monday after lizards, birds and jackals strayed on to a runway to seek refuge from the monsoon rains. Kids play cricket through a downpour in New Delhi as monsoon rains came early to the area this week. Animal rescuers rounded up the critters and moved them to habitats outside airport property. But the operation delayed several flights and shut down the runway for some time, airport spokesman Arun Arora said.

"(CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, the United States Supreme Court loses a judge with an unusual ability to get the big things right by getting the little things right. Justice Stevens will be remembered for his stirring opinions in cases of great national significance. He also should be remembered for his equally compelling commitment to justice in scores of other decisions that received little public notice. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in 2006, Stevens wrote the majority opinion holding that even in the face of real threats of terror, the president must follow the law. The court declared that the Constitution reached into a military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and offered the protection of the rule of law to the man who served as the driver for Osama bin Laden. For Stevens, no person was above the law, and no person was below the law. Stevens' passion for this ideal drew support from his experience as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge. In 1946, the Supreme Court upheld the summary trial and the death sentence meted out by an American military tribunal to accused Japanese war criminal Tomoyuki Yamashita. Dissenting, Rutledge affirmed the importance of providing ""due process of law"" to all people, ""whether citizens, aliens, alien enemies or enemy belligerents."" In Hamdan, Stevens finally vindicated that principle 60 years later. For Stevens, that dedication to ensuring justice in all cases constituted the defining characteristic of a judge. In the 2000 presidential election decision, Bush v. Gore, Stevens penned a stinging dissent, castigating the majority for undermining the ""Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."" Stevens' commitment to the rule of law transcended partisan boundaries. In 1997, he spoke for the Court in Clinton v. Jones, finding that the Constitution did not shield President Clinton with immunity from civil suits. First appointed to the bench by President Nixon and then elevated to the high court by President Ford, Stevens was a Republican from a different era. His rulings fell out of favor with the ideology of that party. However, Stevens always remained a small-R republican. He detested the idea of a monarch who stood outside of the law. He often cited the English maxim, ""The King can do no wrong,"" to emphasize the foreignness of that concept of immunity in our republican form of government. Cases involving presidents are important, but rare. Stevens insisted on promoting the rule of law in all cases. When I think about Stevens, I think not only of Bush and Gore, of Clinton and Rumsfeld, but also of Vladimir Zatko and Jerome Hiersche. It is a bedrock principle of the American legal system that lack of wealth should not translate into a denial of justice. Accordingly, courts do not charge filing fees to those who cannot afford to pay. In the early 1990s, however, the Supreme Court deviated from that practice by barring access to people it deemed frequent filers of frivolous actions. The court refused to waive the fees for these litigants despite their poverty. When the court invoked the rule to bar access to one Vladimir Zatko, Stevens dissented. His opinion criticized the court for undermining its commitment to offering ""equal access to justice for both the rich and the poor."" The court continues to invoke the rule up to this day, and Stevens continues to dissent. And then there is the tragic case of Jerome Hiersche. The United States government hired Hiersche, a professional diver, to inspect a dam on the Columbia River. Government employees assured Hiersche that the water flow system would be shut off, but it was not. Hiersche's head was pulled into an opening in the system, and he was killed. The government denied all liability, citing language in a Supreme Court case interpreting an obscure provision of a 1928 statute. Stevens wrote separately to decry this result, imploring Congress to remedy the situation. He declared that ""this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing more than an engine of injustice."" In his lexicon, there was no stronger rebuke. The rule of law requires standing up to presidents, but it also demands standing up for the notorious and the nameless, the Hamdans and the Yamashitas, the Zatkos and the Hiersches. When one develops a habit of promoting justice in the obscure cases, the courage to demand justice in the notable cases follows. Justice Stevens pursued justice in all cases, great and small. The rule of law has lost an important champion on our nation's highest court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Schapiro.","Justice Stevens stood firmly for the rule of law, his former law clerk says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A 20-inch machete from Costa Rica. New power drills with the tags still hanging. A pile of brass knuckles and nunchucks. Tubs of golf clubs, baseball bats and 10-pound exercise weights. An Atlanta TSA officer holds up some prohibited knives surrendered by passengers over the last month. These objects -- collected at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport security checkpoints -- are among millions of items confiscated by the Transportation Security Administration from travelers' carry-on bags each year. After the U.S. government expanded the list of items prohibited on airplanes in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, air travelers have few options but to surrender their Swiss army knives, cake cutters or whatever banned loot lies in their carry-on bags. Between 2005 and 2006, TSA confiscated 13 million prohibited items, according to a TSA spokesman. On an average month, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport in the world, takes 1,000 pounds of items from passengers. Ever wonder where all the junk goes? Guns and firearms -- which are permitted in a traveler's checked luggage but banned from carry-on bags -- are turned over to local law enforcement. The journey for shampoo and other liquids in containers larger than 3 ounces, which were banned on board in 2006 when terrorists attempted to use liquid explosives, is a short one. They are usually immediately disposed of through private waste contractors.  See what Atlanta's airport has collected in the last month » . But the remaining items that possess some value -- knives, corkscrews, electric saws, meat cleavers and wrenches -- are donated to state surplus agencies. They go up for sale at warehouse auctions, retail stores and online Web sites such as eBay, and states keep the profits. Thrifty citizens can expect to buy the goods for cheap -- often just a fraction of the retail price. ""It's not slowing down,"" said Gary Thornton, program coordinator for the Division of Surplus Property in Kentucky. ""We figured the program would last for a few years and property would stop coming in because people should know better, but it hasn't."" Thornton's agency collects leftover contraband items from various airports in Florida, Ohio and Kentucky. State agencies and youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America get dibs, for just a few dollars per item, on the 10,000 pounds of airport contents brought to the state each month. The unsold items go on to eBay, where the public can pick up knives and Leatherman multitools, usually for 50 percent off the retail price. For several months, Thornton recalls receiving hundreds of miniature baseball bats from Louisville International Airport in Kentucky. They found a nice home for the bats at the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory. TSA reports that bats, clubs, knives and blades remain the most popular contraband items passengers try to take onto airplanes without realizing they are illegal. Prior to 2007, cigarette lighters were illegal. Security officers were gathering 22,000 lighters each day before TSA decided to lift the ban so officers could focus on finding  more dangerous items. TSA doesn't profit from any of the collected items, officials said. Travelers have the option to save their prohibited items by transferring the object to their checked luggage or placing it in their car. Passengers can mail the objects back to themselves if there is a post office nearby. But 90 percent of passengers, who are in a rush to catch a flight or don't want the hassle of leaving the security line, just give the items up, says Shekia Gay, a TSA security officer in Atlanta. He said most passengers he encounters are very understanding about leaving behind their belongings, because they know the rules are meant to keep the public safe. But sometimes surrendering items can result in tears. Gay said once a female passenger came through with a set of expensive kitchen knives that was a wedding present. ""She was very upset and distressed,"" he said. ""Her husband had to calm her down, and we kept telling her this is what we have to do."" Eight years after September 11, travelers continue to bring banned items through the airport security checkpoints, despite continuous efforts by the TSA and airports to publicize what items aren't allowed. With more than 2 million passengers screened by TSA on any given day, officers say they are bound to collect prohibited possessions, said Jon Allen, a TSA spokesman. ""A lot of the things prohibited at checkpoints are allowed to go into checked bags,"" he said. ""If there are items people really need, like a baseball bat or power tools, they can put it in their suitcase and it will still make the trip."" Even items that seem obvious to avoid are brought into security checkpoints. A few years ago, Allen said, a traveler tried to bring two gallons of gasoline because he was concerned his car would run out of gas en route from his home airport. Six months ago, a kitchen sink was found in one man's bag in a Washington airport. The gasoline was disposed of. The kitchen sink was put up for sale. Shane Bailey, director of the Surplus Property Division in Alabama, says he has seen some unusual items -- most notably, a samurai sword -- in the six years his agency has been taking TSA's airport junk. The division picks up leftover booty from Orlando International Airport in Florida. Disney World's home airport yields plenty of fake pirate swords, and the TSA does not allow replica weapons, or even decorative belt buckles shaped like guns or plastic toys, to go aboard. Bailey said the swords are donated to nonprofits working with underprivileged children. On occasion, Alabama airport junk sifters will find family heirlooms or valuable memorabilia. The Alabama surplus staff once discovered a knife engraved with the New York Fire Department logo and a serial number. They tracked down the rightful owner and shipped it back to New York, free of charge. ""If there is a way to get the special items back to someone, we'll go that extra mile,"" he said. But some travel critics and passengers say taking their stuff is obnoxious and does little to deter terrorist threats. Eric Weiner, a columnist for WorldHum.com, a Web site about the travel experience, says he thinks collecting junk from passengers just provides an illusion of security. ""TSA knows collecting peanut butter and nail clippers is not really going to prevent a terrorist attack,"" Weiner said. ""It might catch some very stupid terrorist, but not the smart ones.""","Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport collects 1,000 pounds of junk a month .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A defiant and chaotic protest sprouted in and around a public square Monday despite a warning by Iran's Revolutionary Guard against the kind of street demonstrations that have roiled Iran for more than a week, witnesses said. Security forces patrol the streets of Tehran on Monday. Thousands of Iranians congregated and passed through Haft-e Tir Square, but riot police and the pro-government Basij militia confronted them and smacked their batons against their shin guards, making loud cracking sounds that seemed like gunshots, the witnesses said. As the protests continued, an election official with the Interior Ministry said the ""box-by-box details"" of the ballots -- which were confidential in previous elections -- would be released in response to claims that the election was rigged, Press TV reported. Iran's Guardian Council declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner of the election with 62.63 percent of the vote. His closest rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, received 33.75 percent, surprising many experts who expected him to win. Iranians have continued protesting the results by taking to the streets. Most stores around the square were closed as the unrest reverberated, with some guarding against damage by erecting steel fences on their windows. Helicopters hovered overhead as the security forces wielded batons and used a spray to push the crowd out of the square. After that, police chased down demonstrators in nearby alleys and streets, with protesters and lawmen playing cat and mouse over several tension-filled hours until the crowd began to thin out around dusk. There were isolated face-offs and quarrels that broke out between demonstrators and the riot police and the Basij militia -- a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard, a military unit under the direct control of Iran's supreme leader. There were no reports of serious injuries, but there were at least eight arrests, witnesses said. ""Thirty years after the revolution, this is what we get,"" one man said dejectedly, watching the noisy and chaotic scene as he remembered the birth and the promise of Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. The location was the spot where a vigil was to be held in memory of Neda, a young woman who became a symbol for the opposition after her death was caught on camera. While Internet postings on Twitter, Facebook and an Iranian opposition leader's Web site had mentioned a possible rally, it was unclear whether people who were at the square were there for a vigil. Some people were clad in black, a symbol of mourning, but placards and banners about Neda and candles have not been seen. However, security forces and demonstrators appeared at the square at the time the vigil was to be held.  Watch how women are on front line of protests » . Meanwhile, a message on opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's Facebook page, which could not be authenticated, called for a peaceful demonstration in Tehran on Thursday to honor the dead. ""We are waiting for the route of the march to be announced as well as the location of the sit-in,"" the message said. ""Presently the mausoleum of the founder of the Islamic Republic seems to be the safest place for the sit-in, so that we can mourn for our martyrs in a place that is close to the spirit of that free man. Demonstrators Monday had brushed off a warning from the Revolutionary Guard that people who ""disturb the peace and stand up to security forces"" would be met with a strong response. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the Revolutionary Guard as saying ""the guardians of the Islamic revolution and the courageous Basiji together with the security forces following the orders of the supreme leader and following him unquestioningly."" It said the authorities ""are determined to act strongly to return peace and tranquility to society ... and to clean the country of these plotters and hooligans."" Iran's Revolutionary Guard is directly under the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and enforces the government's Islamic codes and morality. With more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals. The regime's lawmakers called for a review of ties with Britain amid concerns over so-called Western ""meddling"" in the country's daily unrest. The government-funded Press TV reported that Iranian lawmakers were calling for a review of the country's ties with Britain because of its ""interference in Iran's recent post-election unrest."" Britain's Foreign Office announced Monday it is withdrawing the family members of its embassy staff from Iran until the situation there improves. News coverage in Iran has been limited by government restrictions on international journalists. On Sunday, the BBC said Iran had expelled Jon Leyne, the British network's permanent correspondent in Tehran. Al-Arabiya, a Dubai-based Arab satellite network, said its Tehran bureau was ordered closed. At least 19 people were killed in clashes in Tehran on Saturday as Iranians took to the streets to protest the results of the June 12 presidential election, according to hospital sources. Iranian-funded Press TV confirmed 13 fatalities, while unconfirmed reports put the number as high as 150. Tehran's prosecutor general's office said it has launched an investigation into the killings.  Watch one woman's account of clashes with security forces » .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's threatening rhetoric has reached a fever pitch, but the Pentagon and the South Korean government have said it's nothing new. ""We have no indications at this point that it's anything more than warmongering rhetoric,"" a senior Washington Defense official said late Friday. The official was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. State media: North Korea in 'state of war' with South . The National Security Council, which advises the U.S. president on matters of war, struck a similar cord. Washington finds North Korea's statements ""unconstructive,"" and it does take the threats seriously. ""But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats, and today's announcement follows that familiar pattern,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the security council. The United States will continue to update its capabilities against any military threat from the North, which includes plans to deploy missile defense systems. No, North Korea can't hit Hawaii . North Korea's hot rhetoric . Pyongyang's propaganda machine flung new insults at the United States on Saturday. It compared the U.S. mainland with a ""boiled pumpkin,"" unable to endure an attack from a foreign foe, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. North Korea, on the other hand, could sustain an offensive from the outside, the report said. It claimed the government had built shelters around the country ""against any enemy nuclear and chemical weapons attack."" The rhetoric and military show of force by the North have heated up in the face of annual joint military exercise between South Korean and U.S. forces called Foal Eagle. The routine maneuvers are carried out in accordance with the armistice that put an end to armed hostilities in 1953. There was no peace treaty to officially end the war. North Korea's threat: Five things to know . The North Korean government declared the armistice invalid on March 11, 10 days after Foal Eagle began. It is something Pyongyang has done before during heightened tensions. In an added slap, North Korea has declared that it had entered a ""state of war"" with neighboring South Korea, according to a report Saturday from the state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""The condition, which was neither war nor peace, has ended,"" North Korea's government said in a special statement carried by KCNA. Saturday's reports also asserted any conflict ""will not be limited to a local war, but develop into an all-out war, a nuclear war."" The statements made the prospect of war contingent upon ""a military provocation ... against the DPRK"" in sensitive areas on the border between North and South. Analysis: Just what is Kim Jong Un up to? The South: It's not new . South Korea has not treated its neighbor's latest threat as imminent danger. Seoul noted scores of its personnel had entered the Kaesong Industrial Complex -- a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border -- on Saturday morning. Hundreds more were set to join them later in the day, seeming to suggest both sides were going about business as usual. South officials said that North threats to shut down the complex are part of the North's ""measures of putting military alert to highest level,"" but the South was taking the North's words ""seriously,"" the South Korean Unification Ministry Press Office said. The threats aren't ""beneficial"" to the development of the economic zone, the South ministry said. Currently, 310 people work in the industrial complex, the ministry said. ""Our government takes the situation seriously and is prioritizing the safety of our people in Kaesong industrial complex. Our position to maintain stability of Kaesong Industrial Complex remains unchanged,"" the press office said. The South hasn't detected, however, any ""irregular trend"" in the zone, the ministry said. On Saturday, North Korea attacked that sense of normalcy, questioning the future of the cooperation. ""The entry into the Kaesong Industrial Zone by the south side's personnel has been put in jeopardy,"" KCNA reported. The communist government accused Seoul of insulting its dignity with assertions that North Korea would not end the cooperation, because it would be too afraid of losing the revenue it brings. Pyongyang's declaration it was readying its missiles also did not seem to worry officials in the South. ""The announcement made by North Korea is not a new threat, but part of follow-up measures after North Korea's supreme command's statement that it will enter the highest military alert"" on Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . Map appears to show U.S. targets . A day earlier, the same official North Korean news agency reported its leader Kim Jong Un had approved a plan to prepare standby rockets to hit U.S. targets in the Pacific, including in Hawaii, Guam, and South Korea. Behind North Korea's heated words about missile strikes, one analyst said, there might not be much mettle. ""Unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among North Korea's strategic forces, there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on Guam, Hawaii or anywhere else outside the Korean Peninsula that U.S. forces may be stationed,"" James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly, wrote in an opinion column published Thursday on CNN.com. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . U.S. official: We're 'committed ... to peace' U.S. defense officials said Friday that the North's bantering is destructive. ""This is troubling rhetoric that disrupts the prospects for peace on the Peninsula,"" the senior official said. Some observers have suggested that Washington is adding to tensions in the region by drawing attention to its displays of military strength on North Korea's doorstep, such as the flights by the B-2 stealth bombers. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel argued against that assertion Thursday. ""We, the United States and South Korea, have not been involved in provocating anything,"" he said. ""We, over the years, have been engaged with South Korea on joint exercises. The B-2 flight was part of that."" Washington and its allies ""are committed to a pathway to peace,"" Hagel said. ""And the North Koreans seem to be headed in a different direction here."" Opinion: Why North Korea regime is scary . Pyongyang's allies irked . The tense situation has irritated North Korea's traditional allies China and Russia, drawing regular calls for restraint on all sides in recent weeks. Saturday, the Kremlin repeated this admonition. ""Moscow expects all parties to exercise as much responsibility and restraint as possible in light of North Korea's latest statements,"" the Russian foreign ministry said according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. China, which has expressed frustration over Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, also called for calm. ""We hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said Friday, describing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as ""a joint responsibility."" Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt noted Saturday that ""Beijing likely to try to calm things down,"" he said on his Twitter account. ""But the Pyongyang regime is the most militarised, the most authoritarian and the most closed in the world,"" Bildt tweeted. U.S. officials concerned about North Korea's 'ratcheting up of rhetoric' Tensions have been rising for months . Tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive government. Pyongyang has expressed fury about the sanctions and the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, due to continue until the end of April. The deteriorating relations have killed hopes of reviving multilateral talks over North Korea's nuclear program for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Pyongyang has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion. Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father says he is concerned about the last moments of his son's life and about the personal physician who found the pop icon unconscious at the singer's estate. Singer Ne-Yo (L) and host Jamie Foxx pay tribute to Michael Jackson at 2009 BET Awards in Los Angeles. ""I have a lot of concerns,"" Joe Jackson told CNN's Don Lemon on the red carpet leading up to the BET Awards ceremony Sunday night. ""I can't get into that, but I don't like what happened."" Michael Jackson's personal physician, who was questioned extensively by investigators over the weekend, found the singer not breathing in bed when he entered the singer's estate last week, according to the law firm representing the doctor. However, Jackson did have a slight pulse when Dr. Conrad Murray discovered him Thursday, and Murray tried to resuscitate the singer as he awaited paramedics, a representative with the law firm of Stradley, Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston, Texas, told CNN Sunday. Attorney Edward Chernoff is representing Murray. The law firm said reports that Murray injected Jackson with powerful painkillers, such as Demerol or Oxycontin, were false. Funeral arrangements for Jackson were pending Sunday. ""We haven't gotten to that yet -- we're working on that,"" Joe Jackson told CNN's Lemon.  Watch Joe Jackson talk about the death of his son » . Murray voluntarily met for several hours with detectives, the Los Angeles Police Department said late Saturday night. ""Detectives assigned to Robbery-Homicide Division met with Dr. Murray and conducted an extensive interview,"" a police statement said. ""Dr. Murray was cooperative and provided information which will aid the investigation.""  Watch attorney for Jackson's doctor say his client is not a suspect » . Jackson's family suspects that Murray can answer some lingering questions about the singer's last hours, but they have been unable to contact him, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Saturday. ""The routine inquiry is now an investigation,"" Jesse Jackson said. ""They (Jackson's family) didn't know the doctor. ... He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son.""  Watch latest developments in Jackson's death investigation » . Jackson family attorney L. Londell McMillan told CNN that a second autopsy is ""under way."" ""We'll let that process take its course,"" McMillan, who accompanied Joe Jackson to the BET Awards, told CNN. McMillan said a will has not surfaced since Michael Jackson's death and that the singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, is seeking custody of his two children. ""Well, if there is no will, then under the state of California it goes to the next of kin. That's an adult to administer and oversee the best interests of the children and that would be Mr. and Mrs. Jackson,"" McMillan said. ""And Katherine Jackson is the duly appointed person."" He added, ""She will seek custody of the children. That's who Michael would have wanted to have the children, she loves them dearly."" On Saturday, the founder of 1-800-AUTOPSY, a private firm that conducts autopsies, told CNN that the Jackson family had contacted the business to inquire about possibly having a second autopsy done there. Jesse Jackson added on Saturday that the family needed ""an independent autopsy to get even more answers to questions that are now being driven by the gap between when Michael was last seen alive and was pronounced dead.""iReport.com: Tributes pour in for Jackson . There are lingering questions, including: ""How long had he stopped breathing? How long had he been unconscious?"" Jesse Jackson said. Michael Jackson was discovered unconscious Thursday by paramedics at his home, where Murray apparently had tried to revive him. He was rushed to a Los Angeles medical center, where he was pronounced dead.  Listen to the 911 call » . An autopsy performed by a county medical examiner was inconclusive -- although officials said there were no indications of external trauma or foul play. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said more tests are needed before a cause of death can be determined. That could take four to six weeks. Detectives impounded Murray's car, which was parked at the singer's rented home, because, they said, it may contain evidence related to Jackson's death, possibly prescription medications. Police have released no information on what they may have found.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that it would work to ban the sale of some mouse and rat poisons in a bid to better protect children and pets. The agency in 2008 gave makers of such poisons until last week to research, develop and register new products that would be safer than those that were then on the market. Many companies complied, but some did not. Among the targets are such popular rodent poisons as D-Con, Victor and Hot Shot, the agency said. ""These changes are essential to reduce the thousands of accidental exposures of children that occur every year from rat and mouse control products and also to protect household pets,"" said Steve Owens, assistant administrator for EPA's office of chemical safety and pollution prevention. ""Today's action will help keep our children and pets safe from these poisons."" The EPA said that as many as 15,000 children under the age of 6 are exposed to rat and mouse poisons each year. Children are especially at risk, the agency said, because poisons are often put on the floor and kids will sometimes put bait pellets in their mouths. The sales ban would cover most loose bait and pellet products, the agency said. The EPA also intends to ban the residential sale of poisons that contain certain compounds -- brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone and difenacoum -- because of their toxicity. Professional pest control and agricultural workers would still be allowed to use them, the agency said.","The agency cites a need to better protect children and pets .

"(CNN)  -- A controversial extra-time goal by William Gallas saw France reach the World Cup finals after a 1-1 home draw against the Republic of Ireland in Paris on Wednesday night. France were trailing 1-0 in the second leg, with the scores tied 1-1 on aggregate, when Arsenal central defender Gallas forced the ball home for the decisive goal. But TV replays showed that his former club teammate Thierry Henry had clearly handled the ball twice before passing to him to head home. Irish goalkeeper Shay Given frantically gestured to the referee and Damien Duff was booked for his protests, but the goal stood and Raymond Domenech's men eventually went through after surviving late pressure in the Stade de France. Robbie Keane had given the Republic a deserved first half lead as he scored after a fine cutback by Duff. The pair both had chances in the second half to put the game out of France's reach, but home keeper Hugo Lloris blocked Duff's effort after he was clean through and forced Tottenham star Keane wide from a similar position. Cristiano Ronaldo will be going to World Cup after his Portugal side won 1-0 in Bosnia-Herzegovina to claim it 2-0 on aggregate in their European playoff match in Zenica. Real Madrid star Ronaldo sat out both legs of the decider through injury, but despite his absence Portugal qualified for the World Cup for the third time in a row. Raul Meireles' second-half goal in the second leg gave them a comfortable victory in a tie deemed awkward after a slender victory in the first leg secured though a goal by Bruno Alves. A pass from Nan found Meireles, whose low shot found the net and sent the Portuguese, who reached the semifinals in 2006, through. Slovenia upset Russia to qualify for the World Cup finals for only the second time with a 1-0 home win in Maribor. Slovenia trailed 2-1 from the first leg and go through on the away goals rule with the aggregate score tied 2-2. Striker Zlatko Dedic, who plays for Bochum in the Bundesliga, scored on the stroke of halftime. He reacted first to a Valter Birsa cross from the right to grab the crucial goal. Guus Hiddink's men suffered a further setback when substitute striker Alexander Kerzhakov was shown the red card in the 68th minute. Andrei Arshavin set up substitute Pavel Pogrebnyak for a late chance as Russia forced for an equalizer which would have put them through, but Dedic should have scored a  second for Slovenia late on. 2004 European champions Greece are also through as they beat Ukraine 1-0 in Donetsk with Dimitrios Salpigidis scoring the only goal for the visitors on the half hour mark. The Panathinaikos striker beat the offside trap after a superb pass from Celtic's Georgios Samaras and slotted home. The teams played out a 0-0 draw on Saturday in the first leg in Athens. Ukraine pressed desperately for an equalizer in the second half but to no avail.","France through after controversial equalizer against Ireland in Stade de France .

"(CNN) -- Recently developed ""touch DNA"" technology has cleared all members of JonBenet Ramsey's family of her slaying, authorities said Wednesday. Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy said no one in the Ramsey family is considered a suspect and formally apologized in a letter to John Ramsey for the cloud of suspicion his family has lived under for nearly 12 years. ""To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,"" Lacy wrote.  Read the letter » . Instead, DNA tests conducted earlier this year point to an ""unknown male,"" in the 6-year-old child beauty pageant contestant's December 1996 slaying. Early on in the case, Boulder police said parents John and Patsy Ramsey, and their son, Burke, were under ""an umbrella of suspicion"" in JonBenet's death, although they were never named as suspects. John Ramsey found his daughter's body in the basement of the family's Boulder, Colorado, home on December 26, 1996. She had been strangled and beaten. Testing in 1998 showed that DNA evidence found in the girl's underwear and beneath her fingernails was from an unidentified man and did not match anyone in the Ramsey family.  Follow the timeline » . Tests conducted in March revealed that new DNA collected from a pair of long johns matched a sample previously taken from the child's panties. Genetic material was scraped from the waistband of the long johns, which JonBenet was wearing over her underwear when her body was found. Lacy said in her statement that authorities believe the long johns were either replaced or removed by her killer. Additional tests were conducted to ensure that the genetic material did not come from law enforcement or medical examiner's personnel, the statement said. ""The unexplained third-party DNA on the clothing of the victim is very significant and powerful evidence,"" Lacy's statement said. ""It is therefore the position of the Boulder District Attorney's Office that this profile belongs to the perpetrator of the homicide."" That same DNA also exonerated John Mark Karr, a one-time schoolteacher, after he was arrested in Thailand and confessed to the killing in 2006. Lacy was widely criticized for the handling of Karr's arrest. Lacy took pains to state that her office does not consider JonBenet's father, her mother -- now deceased -- or older brother to be suspects. She said she released the findings in the interest of justice. Lacy blamed ""evidence reported by the media"" rather than ""evidence that had been tested in court"" for suspicions cast on the Ramseys as the case was investigated, suspicions that she said ""created an ongoing living hell for the Ramsey family and their friends."" She added, ""We believe that justice indicates that the Ramseys be treated only as victims of this very serious crime."" John Ramsey told CNN affiliate KUSA that he is ""grateful"" that there is ""irrefutable DNA evidence"" that clears the family.  Watch John Ramsey express his gratitude » . ""It's hard for people to accept and think that someone could come into a home and murder a child from their bed and we were perhaps an answer,"" he said. ""It became an entertainment event for a lot of the media, sadly. ... It boosted ratings, attracted viewers, to develop that controversy."" Ramsey continued, ""You know the pain, the intense pain that we felt was the loss of our child. The accusations and the finger pointing weren't significant ... We were deeply crushed by the loss of our child, particularly in the manner that it happened."" Ramsey said his late wife also would be ""thankful for the continuing efforts to find the killer."" Atlanta attorney Lin Wood, who represents the Ramseys, told CNN that Patsy Ramsey's death is ""one of the sad notes of today's news, because she's not here with us to celebrate the vindication of her family."" ""What's happened today, though, is irrefutable DNA evidence has now resulted in John and Patsy and their son, Burke, being officially cleared in this case,"" he added. ""This family suffered too many years, too many heartaches of being falsely accused in the murder of their child.""","New DNA tests exonerate all members of JonBenet Ramsey's family .

"Libyans cheered the fate of ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi into the early hours of Friday after his death in what Libya's transitional prime minister described as a crossfire that followed his arrest by revolutionary forces. ""This is a time to start a new Libya, with a new economy, with a new education and with a new health system -- with one future,"" Mahmoud Jibril, Libya's transitional prime minister, said after proclaiming Gadhafi's death. Gadhafi was captured alive and unharmed as troops from the National Transitional Council overran his hometown of Sirte on Thursday, Jibril said. But a gunbattle erupted between transitional council fighters and Gadhafi's supporters as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle, Jibril said, leaving Gadhafi with a wound to his right arm. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi -- who ruled Libya for nearly 42 years before rebel forces overthrew him in August -- was hit in the head, Jibril said, Gadhafi died moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner. Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks captured some of the onetime Libyan strongman's last moments, as the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi was being hauled onto a truck. Another video showed a dead Gadhafi with what appeared to be a head wound. According to Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, troops found Gadhafi in a large drainage pipe. Daily Telegraph reporter Ben Farmer in Sirte old CNN's Anderson Cooper the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand. The phrases ""The place of the rat Gadhafi"" and ""You scum"" were painted around its exterior, apparently after the capture. Jibril said Gadhafi was carrying a gun but did not resist his captors. Jibril said DNA samples confirmed Gadhafi's identity, and the International Criminal Court -- which had issued an arrest warrant for the ousted dictator on war-crimes charges -- has agreed to allow Gadhafi's burial. Aujali said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes. In one video from the scene, a voice can be heard shouting, ""No, no, we want him alive, we want him alive."" U.S., NATO and French officials said transitional government fighters captured Gadhafi's convoy after French warplanes and a U.S. drone forced it to a halt on the way out of Sirte. Following Gadhafi's death, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Thursday that the alliance ""will terminate our mission,"" launched in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians. Amnesty International called for the National Transitional Council to mount ""a full, independent and impartial inquiry"" into Gadhafi's death and said his inner circle and family should be ""treated humanely and, if captured, given fair trials."" Abubaker Saad, who was a Gadhafi aide for nine years, said it didn't really matter whether Gadhafi was dead or alive as long as he was no longer a fugitive. ""As long as he was on the run, he represented a very ominous danger to the Libyan people,"" Saad said. ""He represented a very ominous danger ... to the idea of the democracy in Libya."" The streets of Tripoli echoed with celebratory gunfire, car horns and cheers as crowds ran or danced through the streets. Celebrations extended into early Friday in Tripoli and Misrata, where crowds waved flags in the city's main square long after midnight. On the surrounding roads, drivers leaned on their horns and came to brake-squealing stops as bands of revelers darted in and out of traffic. ""A black era has come to an end forever,"" the Libyan ambassador to Britain, Mahmoud Al Nacoua, said in London. National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil will officially announce on Saturday Libya's liberation, media committee member Mohamed Elkish told CNN on Thursday.  Council officials have said after such a declaration a new government would soon be announced and the democratic transition would begin. Gadhafi's killing caps a revolt that began in February and left him a fugitive for the past two months. The mercurial former army officer, who seized power in a 1969 coup, was the third Arab leader ousted in the Arab Spring upheavals that began in neighboring Tunisia in January. Also killed Thursday were Gadhafi's son Motassim and his chief of intelligence, Abdullah al-Senussi, said Anees al-Sharif, a spokesman for the National Transitional Council's military arm in Tripoli. Other reports say al-Senussi was captured. Jibril said Gadhafi's defense minister, Gen. Abu Baker Younes, also died. Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics, said Libyans still face a difficult political struggle. But, he added, ""We should not underestimate the significance of this day."" ""Gadhafi was the head of the state, the most important symbol of the country. He repeatedly tried to rally his supporters to fight on,"" Gerges said. ""I hope that this particular day will not just mean the end of an era, but basically represent the beginning of a new era."" Gerges said the recent fighting around Sirte and another holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists, Bani Walid, exposed ""some major tribal and regional cleavages"" that Libyans will have to bridge in forming a new government. Those differences ""could easily escalate, given the extent and the intensity of differences in Libya."" But he said Gadhafi's death sends a signal to other strongmen in the region: ""If you oppress your people, if you don't engage your civil society, if you stay in power for so many years, this will be your end."" Fran Townsend, CNN national security contributor, said the transitional leadership ""faces very serious challenges,"" citing groups outside Libya's borders, including al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as internal strife among the country's tribes. ""There will be those around them who seek to take advantage,"" Townsend said. ""There will be tribal differences, there will be Gadhafi loyalists who melt into the population and attempt to launch an insurgency like what we saw in Iraq."" Prince Idris Al-Senussi, whose family was overthrown by Gadhafi 42 years ago, told CNN, ""I feel now that finally I can go back to a free country.  A country that I have loved ... and I feel proud that the Libyan people have done it themselves."" The confirmation of Gadhafi's death came after hours of conflicting reports on the deposed leader's status. When those reports first reached U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a visit to Afghanistan, she reacted with one word: ""Wow."" Clinton said the end of Gadhafi would ""add legitimacy and relief to the formation of a new government."" In a brief address from the White House, President Barack Obama praised Libyans for lifting ""the dark shadow of tyranny"" with the aid of Western air power. ""One year ago, the notion of a free Libya seemed impossible,"" Obama said. ""But then the Libyan people rose up and demanded their rights. And when Gadhafi and his forces started going city to city, town by town, to brutalize men, women and children, the world refused to stand idly by."" NATO, spearheaded by Britain and France, backed up the revolt by bombarding pro-Gadhafi forces. In a statement from his office, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Gadhafi's ouster marks the start of ""a new era ... one of reconciliation in unity and freedom."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday ""is a day to remember all of Colonel Gadhafi's victims,"" including the 270 dead in the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 and ""the many, many Libyans who died at the hands of this brutal dictator and his regime."" Other world leaders sounded encouragement for a new Libya, but cautioned that the road ahead won't be easy. ""In the coming days, we will witness scenes of celebration, as well as grief for those who lost so much,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""Yet let us recognize, immediately, that this is only the end of the beginning. The road ahead for Libya and its people will be difficult and full of challenges.""","Libyan prince happy there is now a ""free country""

"Glenn Beck may not want to vote for Hillary Clinton, but he is convinced that she will win the presidency in 2016.

""She is going to win,"" Beck said, matter-of-factly, because Clinton will convince voters that she is the candidate that can take the United States back to ""the golden years"" of Bill Clinton's administration. Beck said, ""Here's what Hillary is going to do. [She will say] 'Do you remember when America was good? Do you remember when we had jobs and we were building towards a brighter future, and things were really happening? Clinton administration, we had it under control.

Clinton has crisscrossed the country on a book tour this summer and stoked the presidential flames throughout most of the tour. Republicans have kept their focus on Clinton, and they've argued that if the former secretary of state runs, she will become President Barack Obama's third term, not Bill Clinton's. Even some close to Clinton have quietly expressed concern that one of the most effective critiques could be that her presidency, should she run and be elected, would be nothing more than President Barack Obama's third term.

"By . Patricia Shipp . Intoxicated: Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett was arrested on Wednesday after being brought into custody for refusing to cooperate with police at Minneapolis-St. Paul airport . It has been revealed that troubled Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett was fueled by a potent cocktail of prescription drugs and vodka when he was arrested at a Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport bar on Wednesday. Admitting to police that he had started drinking at 9am that morning, the troubled 59-year-old journalist was taken into custody at 12.39pm at the Northern Lights Grill in the airport's main terminal. Once in jail, Jarrett, who was carrying papers indicating that he had just been released from rehab, launched into a furious and confrontational tirade at police, repeatedly screaming, 'f*** you', before officers physically restrained and cuffed him. He remained in Hennepin County Jail until around 1:30 a.m. Thursday and was released on $300 bond. Officers arrived at the bar after a bartender called about Jarrett, who appeared to be extremely drunk. Jarrett had only been served one drink and was making another customer feel uncomfortable, admitting to them that he had taken medication before his flight. The Fox News anchor appeared mentally agitated and had trouble replying to any questions asked of him with more than one word answers. Scroll down for video of Jarrett slurring his speech on the air . Reporter: Jarrett, 59, pictured, was booked on a preliminary charge of obstructing the legal process by interfering with a peace officer, which is a misdemeanor . He repeatedly denied any request from officers to see his ID and was clearly swaying wildly while seated at the bar - using his arm to grab the bar to keep from falling off his stool. Described as being in a 'fog', Jarrett's unwillingness to cooperate led officers to taken him into custody because 'he would be unable to properly care for himself.' At this point, Jarrett was not handcuffed and while he was walked to the squad car, he was overhead mumbling 'sorry' over and over. Admitting he had been drinking since the morning, officers searched his bag and found three pills identified as Gabapentin - which is used to treat seizures and bi-polar disorder. Jarrett did not have any prescriptions for the drugs on him and evidence was found that revealed he had just been released from rehab. However, once in custody, Jarrett's mood turned ugly and when he was being evaluated by medical staff he began to scream, 'This is your fault' at the arresting officer. 'His body became rigid and he leaned forward like he was going to jump up on his feet or launch himself off of the bench,' said arresting officer, Mark Dorsey. 'He yelled, 'f*** you!' and at this point, police felt that Jarrett was a danger to himself and others and went to cuff him.

"(CNN) -- The great Davos talking shop is now up and running, with delegates of all levels of importance, shapes and nationalities zeroing in on this quaint, alpine town to put the world to rights. For many ordinary people the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) is yet another ""important"" summit in the calendar where the elite of business and politics will schmooze for a few days in a rarefied environment they have little or no experience of. Whether or not you believe events such as Davos justify their lofty ambitions, they are certainly a unique experience. So how do you become a Davos delegate? Official invite . The World Economic Forum is strictly by invitation only, with 2,500 participants representing over 100 countries. The roll call includes CEOs and representatives from the world's biggest corporations; politicians and heads of state from the G20 and other key countries; technology innovators; social entrepreneurs; philanthropists and media companies. Adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend. While the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups -- heads of state, faith leaders, academics, social entrepreneurs, members of international organizations and news anchors -- for businesses, the cost of a ticket is approximately $20,000. Huge travel budget . Getting to this small ski resort, nestled in a picturesque valley high up in the Swiss Alps 150 km south-west of Zurich, is not for the budget traveler. For a delegate arriving from New York this week flying business class, the price comes in at between $4,800 and $7,200. A visitor from Tokyo can expect to pay between $4,500 and $8,300, while a delegate flying in from Johannesburg, South Africa will pay around $4,900. And once in Zurich there's the small matter of the transfer to Davos. A regular shuttle bus and train service is available, but a two-hour trip by public transport may not suit the business client. The alternative would be a limousine which would cost around $700 for a one-way trip. However corporate CEOs may choose to come by helicopter, which last year cost around $9,500 for a return flight. Place to stay . Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels. Predictably tariffs reflect the resulting demand/supply imbalance, with a room in a modest three-star hotel coming in at around $600 per night. Those with a considerably bigger budget often choose to rent out whole apartments or chalets. A chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as $60,000 - though catering might just be included. The right outfit . It's cold in Davos, very cold. At 5,052 ft (1,540m) above see level, temperatures average -6 degrees Celsius (21.1 degrees Fahrenheit) in January. Thermal underwear, winter jackets and snow boots are a must, particularly when the temperature plummets in the evenings as you make your way to the various cocktail parties, meals and social events hosted by partner companies. It is not uncommon to see $2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the Congress Center. Spot the VIPs . For an outsider, the gathering in Davos might look like a big party for anyone who matters in the world. In reality, the meeting in Davos is ruled by a strict hierarchy. Access to some places is strictly for a a few dozens of heads of state, royalty, the CEOs of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations. How do you spot the very, very important people among the 2,500 delegates? Look for the badges. Anyone wearing a white badge is an official delegate, who got invited to the conference. Spouses of delegates and ""strategic partners,"" who sponsor the WEF, have similar badges. The most exclusive badge, the kind that gets you access to the behind the scenes secret society (officially known as the Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders), is the one with a holographic sticker. Knowing where to go . With all the above boxes ticked, it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport-style security -- there are 4,000 Swiss troops in Davos this week -- and made it inside the newly-extended Congress Center with the correct color of identity pass. Some delegates do nothing but network with other delegates, oblivious to the feverish discussions going all around them about the post-crisis new reality. So delegates can spend four days roaming this cavernous indoor amphitheater attending conferences and workshops about everything from how the environment agenda will change in light of current trends and norms, to how music can transform communities and unite people. $40,000-per head well spent.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hurricanes are rare in Hawaii. It's even rarer when an incumbent governor or senator loses a primary election in the state. It had never happened before Saturday. Hurricanes Iselle and Julio left the state intact this week, but a Democratic primary election washed Gov. Neil Abercrombie from office. State Sen. David Ige defeated him and will face Republican Duke Aiona November's general elections. Hawaii's incumbent U.S. senator, Brian Schatz, might also get doused. His primary race against Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is too close to call. Just 11 votes separate them. President Obama, in a rare move, chose sides in a Democratic primary, supporting Schatz's bid earlier this year. But the President's decision is at odds with the dying wish of the senator whom Schatz succeeded. Days before his death in 2012, Daniel Inouye made clear he wanted Hanabusa to succeed him. Abercrombie defied that request, instead appointing Schatz, who was then the lieutenant governor. Obama had also supported Abercrombie's reelection. Hawaii has long rewarded political incumbents. Since its statehood, no governor had ever lost in a primary in Hawaii. Additionally, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser notes that ""no incumbent U.S. senator -- appointed or elected -- has lost an election."" CNN's Ashley Killough and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","An incumbent Hawaii governor never had lost a primary before .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Bush on Monday said he reluctantly accepted the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, whose ""good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons."" Alberto Gonzales and his wife, Rebecca, have lunch with President and Laura Bush at the Bush ranch Sunday. After months of standing by his top prosecutor and ""close friend,"" Bush spoke briefly in Texas to praise Gonzales, saying the attorney general endured ""unfair treatment that has created harmful distraction at the Justice Department."" Bush said it's ""sad that we live in a time when a talented and honorable person"" is impeded ""from doing important work."" Solicitor General Paul Clement will serve as acting attorney general, Bush said, until a nominee has been confirmed by the Senate. Earlier in Washington, Gonzales announced his resignation, saying, ""I have lived the American dream."" The first Latino to helm the Justice Department said his ""worst days as attorney general have been better than my father's best days.""  Watch Gonzales on his ""worst days"" as top prosecutor » . Gonzales  described public service as ""honorable and noble"" and thanked Bush for his friendship. ""Yesterday I met with President Bush and informed him of my decision to conclude my government services as attorney general of the United States effective September 17."" Neither Bush nor Gonzales took questions from reporters. Some senior administration officials floated Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff as a possible replacement, but others waved CNN away from Chertoff, saying that his nomination could run into problems because of his role during Hurricane Katrina. A congressional source familiar with deliberations about Gonzales' replacement told CNN that the successor will not be Chertoff and that senior administration officials are ""playing you guys,"" referring to the media. A source close to Chertoff said of a possible nomination, ""this would be a surprise to Mike."" New York Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also suggested that a Chertoff confirmation hearing would be contentious. ""I would say there are a lot of questions about Michael Chertoff that will have to be answered."" Schumer said. ""I wouldn't say yes; I wouldn't say no.  It's an open book.  It's possible, but its hardly a slam dunk.  There are some names who could be a slam dunk."" Schumer, one of Gonzales' chief critics, appealed to the administration ""to work with us to nominate someone whom Democrats can support and America can be proud of."" Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee who has criticized Gonzales' leadership of the Justice Department, called his resignation ""a major helpful turn of events."" Specter suggested current or former senators, or someone well-known to the committee would be a good nominee to replace Gonzales. ""There has to be somebody with very solid professional qualifications, somebody who's an experienced lawyer and has demonstrated the kind of judgment that the attorney general is called upon to display,"" Specter said. A senior administration official ""aware of discussions"" said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten is looking for a Washington establishment-type, in the model of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and White House counsel Fred Fielding. Another name that emerged is Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general who currently serves as vice president and general counsel for PepsiCo. But a spokeswoman for the company said, ""We are very fortunate and pleased, but he is very happy in his role here."" According to senior administration officials, when Thompson has been approached in the past to return to the government he has turned down offers, saying he is happy in the private sector. Aides at the highest level and other top officials received no warning about the Gonzales announcement, Justice Department sources told CNN. They were not informed until a meeting Monday morning, sources said, when Gonzales acknowledged he would be reading a statement later in the day. Although Bush had long stood by Gonzales, many members of Congress from both sides of the aisle had called on him to quit after the firing of several U.S. attorneys in 2006 -- terminations which were alleged to have been politically motivated. Senior Justice Department officials say Gonzales' resignation is not expected to affect the scope or pace of an ongoing internal investigation into the U.S. attorneys' dismissals and other issues. ""Alberto Gonzales was never the right man for this job,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday. ""He lacked independence, he lacked judgment and he lacked the spine to say no to Karl Rove."" Rove, another longtime Bush official and his top political adviser, also resigned this month. ""This resignation is not the end of the story,"" Reid warned. ""Congress must get to the bottom of this mess and follow the facts where they lead, into the White House."" Throughout Gonzales' time as attorney general, controversies surrounded his positions on issues such as U.S. interrogation techniques and the wiretapping of conversations between Americans and suspected terrorists overseas. In the probe into the U.S. attorney firings, the Senate Judiciary Committee looked into whether the administration may have fired some or all of the U.S. attorneys for political reasons. In his testimony before the committee on multiple occasions, Gonzales repeatedly seemed to contradict himself, other members of his department or Justice Department documents. Gonzales also was at the center of a dispute over the controversial no-warrant eavesdropping program authorized by Bush and his testimony that there was no dissent among administration officials over the program. Gonzales later sent a letter to Senate leaders acknowledging he ""may have created confusion"" in his testimony. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Those battling global warming by promoting biofuels may unintentionally be adding to skyrocketing world food prices, creating what one expert calls ""a silent tsunami"" in developing nations. The rising prices are ""threatening to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger,"" Josette Sheeran, executive director of the United Nations' World Food Program, said on the agency's Web site Tuesday. Sheeran is one of the experts attending a Food summit hosted Tuesday by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, aimed at determining ways to boost food supplies and identify deterrents. Also attending the meeting are scientists and representatives from the European Union and Africa. On the Web site, Sheeran said the increase in food prices is ""a silent tsunami that respects no borders."" ""The world's misery index is rising ... as soaring food and fuel prices roll through the lives of the most vulnerable,"" she said Friday. The crisis is forcing the organization to look for cuts in aid to some of its recipients, she said. Soaring food prices have triggered violence in some developing countries, and biofuels are bearing at least part of the blame. Producing fuel from plant crops is supposed to be greener than drilling for oil, and biofuels generally burn cleaner, too. But the global biofuels industry now stands accused of a list of side effects that are said to be damaging lives, especially of the world's poorest people. ""The drive for more biofuels means more investment is going into those crops, meaning less land and less investment going in for food crops, causing a massive conflict and resulting in rising prices, which is having a huge negative impact, especially on developing countries,"" said Clare Oxborrow, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth.  See why tortilla makers are blaming biofuel for increasing food prices » . Critics also say that in Africa, Asia and South America, people are being driven from their land and forests are being cleared to make room for the booming biofuel industry. The International Food Policy Research Institute says the use of cereals for industrial purposes like making biofuels has risen by a quarter since 2000. Brown said in an article posted on the 10 Downing Street Web site, ""We now know that biofuels intended to promote energy independence and combat climate change are frequently energy-inefficient. ""We need to look closely at the impact on food prices and the environment of different production methods and to ensure we are more selective in our support. If our UK review shows that we need to change our approach, we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets,"" he said. ""We must also do more to explore the links between climate change and food, and particularly their impact on the livelihoods and vulnerability of the very poorest, who are likely to be most affected by climate change."" The meeting he convened, Brown said, is a precursor to the G8 summit of industrial nations, to be held in July, and a special U.N. summit in September. He urged prompt action. ""With one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes, the time to act is now,"" Brown stressed. The World Health Organization views hunger as the No. 1 threat to public health around the world, responsible for a third of child deaths and 10 percent of all disease. Douglas Alexander, Britain's International Development secretary, announced Tuesday that Britain has set aside a 455 million-pound [$900 million] aid package to address the food crisis. His agency manages Britain's aid to poor countries with the goal of eliminating extreme poverty. E-mail to a friend .

"Buchanan, New York (CNN) -- Stepping into the containment dome of Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 is almost surreal. It's like entering a movie set, but instead of walking by wooden props, we're passing through an 11-foot-thick concrete-and-steel wall. This is the nuclear facility that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to shut down, the long-time target of both anti-nuclear and environmental activists, the nuclear power plant that sits only some 25 miles from New York City. Just a strip of yellow tape warning of radioactive danger separates me, my producer Sheila Steffen and cameramen Rod Griola and Ken Borland from white-uniformed technicians who are removing groups of nuclear fuel rods (204 rods are packaged together in each fuel assembly) and inserting new ones, a month-long process that takes place every two years. Armed guards stand behind us, even after we have cleared three levels of tight security and a radiation briefing. Getting into the White House is easier, far easier. Around my neck are two Indian Point security passes and two dosimeters that will measure the amount of radiation I receive: one will be sent for analysis to a laboratory, the other is an electronic-arming dosimeter, a real-time radiation detector set to beep if I were to receive a dose of 100 millirems per hour. (During our radiation briefing we are told a chest x-ray delivers 8 millirems.) A massive 100-ton steel plug hangs from cables. Below, workers surround the nuclear core, which is underwater. They control machinery that delicately moves the fuel assemblies through a water-filled canal connected to the spent fuel pool, where rods filled with uranium pellets cool down for years. There are nearly 50,000 uranium pellets in each fuel assembly collection of rods. Pumps keep water circulating into the pool so it remains at a temperature of 100-degrees Fahrenheit (compared to the 2,100 degrees that nuclear fuel can reach before it would meltdown). So, keeping the power on here is essential to averting disaster. Indian Point receives its power from the same electric grid to which it contributes. If the power goes out -- and it briefly did only three weeks ago due to a utility technician's error -- backup diesel generators kick in to keep the plant functioning. That's exactly what happened during the recent outage. Each of Indian Point's two reactors have three auxiliary diesel generators, and then there are separately located backups to those backups as well as diesel-driven fire pumps that can keep the spent fuel rod pools filled. It's all designed to avoid the kind of catastrophe that occurred at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plant managers spend lots of time thinking about potential emergencies and how to avert them. ""Our plant is designed to handle the worst natural disaster. Our people are trained. We have many layers of redundancy,"" said John Dinelli, director of operations at Indian Point. The plant is built to withstand at least a 6.0-magnitude earthquake, greater than the region has ever experienced, though researchers at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory warn a 7.0 is not out of the realm of possibility since they have determined the plants is built near the intersection of two active seismic zones. ""We believe that we can handle a (magnitude) 7 earthquake,"" said Joseph Pollock, vice president of operations for Entergy, the plant's owner. ""The theoretically highest predicted earthquake in this area would be of a magnitude where our plant design will be able to withstand that and we would be able to respond and shut the plant down in a safe manner."" In truth, Indian Point's operators say, a severe hurricane is a far more likely event, for which they also have extensive contingency plans. During the month-long refueling process at unit No. 3, the containment dome's hatch remains open. To be prepared for a natural hazard -- or even the possibility of an attack -- Indian Point keeps a giant plug sitting on a massive forklift nearby that plant workers can shove into place within 15 minutes to protect the reactor. Such precautions and procedures are part of Entergy's application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year operating license renewal. Unit No. 3's license expires in 2015, unit No. 2 in 2013. (Indian Point shut down its original reactor, No. 1, in 1974). Back inside the dome, after technicians vertically lift a 12-foot fuel assembly from the nuclear core, they turn it horizontally and move it along a water-filled canal to the adjacent building that houses the spent fuel pool where the assembly is positioned in an upright rack for cooling, which takes years. The pool about 40 feet deep, surrounded by 6 feet of concrete on all sides, and it has a greenish tint to it. Workers stand on metal ramps overhead, prepared to accept the next spent fuel assembly. My electronic arming dosimeter registers a .3 millirem, its first detection of radiation. In a locked, plexiglass-enclosed case not far from the pool sit brand new fuel assemblies fresh from Westinghouse, waiting their turn for a swim to the nuclear reactor core. As precise as the underwater operations are, they are not without flaw. In unit No. 2, Indian Point's other active plant, there has been a relatively small leak during refueling that officials say has let out as much as eight gallons of contaminated water a day into the containment dome area. ""We haven't found the exact location of the leak to be able to do the repair and stop it,"" said Pollock. ""We're working with a couple of firms. Right now there's a technique being used in Germany that we're trying to see if it would work here and we're going through that evaluation right now."" Pollock says the leak is neither cause for concern nor a safety hazard since it's within one of the reactor domes. As we leave the spent fuel pool, we hand in both our dosimeters for analysis before stepping into a device that detects if we've picked up any contaminants on our clothing or shoes. I step in, push my chest against the oversized metal detector style contraption, wait an uncomfortably long 30-seconds, then do the same with my back up against the device. My heartbeat slows as I step through the locked security gate and walk back towards the largest part of the nuclear plant: the power-generating room. This is where the steam that's created from the nuclear reactor flows through huge tubes to turn giant turbines that power the generator that produces the electricity Indian Point sends off to the grid. Each plant generates 1,000 megawatts of power, providing as much as 30% of the electricity for New York and Westchester County. Since unit No. 3 is undergoing refueling, workers are busy maintaining and upgrading the turbines and generator. Both Indian Point plants are pressurized water reactors, as opposed to the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan, which is a boiling water reactor. Pressurized reactors aren't necessarily safer than boiling water reactors, they just employ a different technique to harness the heat generated by nuclear fission to produce steam. As the nuclear crisis unfolds in Japan, Indian Point officials say they're hoping for details that might help operations here. ""Undoubtedly we will come back with lessons learned to continue to improve our safety margins and increase them even further,"" said Pollack. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is initiating a safety review of Indian Point and all other U.S. nuclear power facilities, as part of its response to the crisis in Japan.","CNN Correspondent Allan Chernoff and his crew go into a nuclear power facility .

"(CNN) -- A Rutgers University student who apparently committed suicide was the unknowing target of an internet broadcast showing him in a sexual encounter, New Jersey authorities said Wednesday. Two other Rutgers students have been charged with invasion of privacy after they allegedly placed a camera in 18-year-old Tyler Clementi's dorm room without his knowledge and then broadcast Clementi's sexual encounter, according to the Middlesex County prosecutor's office. ""If the charges are true, these actions gravely violate the university's standards of decency and humanity,"" Rutgers President Richard L. McCormick said in a statement Wednesday. Your say: Invasion of privacy or cyber bullying? Although Clementi's body has not been found, an attorney for the Ridgewood, New Jersey, family said Wednesday, ""On behalf of the family of Tyler Clementi, I can confirm that Tyler committed suicide last week by jumping from the George Washington Bridge."" ""The family and their representatives are cooperating fully with the ongoing criminal investigations of two Rutgers University students,"" attorney Paul Mainardi added. A law enforcement source confirmed with CNN that while a body has not yet been recovered, Clementi's wallet and cell phone were found on the bridge that spans the Hudson River between New Jersey and New York. Dharun Ravi, 18, of Plainsboro, New Jersey, and Molly Wei, 18, of Princeton, New Jersey, are each charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for the September 19 broadcast, according to the prosecutor's office. Two more counts of invasion of privacy were leveled against Ravi for an attempt to videotape another encounter involving Clementi on September 21, the prosecutor's office said. It is unclear exactly how Rutgers campus police learned that a camera had been placed in Clementi's room and used to broadcast his encounter. Both Wei and Ravi surrendered to campus police -- Wei surrendered on Monday and was released on her own recognizance; Ravi surrendered Tuesday and was released on $25,000 bail. Ravi's attorney did not return phone calls from CNN. According to the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, Wei apparently had not retained an attorney as of Wednesday. If convicted, both could face up to five years in prison. Police at the university, which has its main campus in New Brunswick, are investigating the case, university president McCormick said in his statement Wednesday. ""I deeply regret that today we learned from the family of one of our students that they believe their son has committed suicide. We are profoundly saddened by this report, and our hearts and prayers are with the parents, family, and friends of this young man, who had started at Rutgers this semester as a first-year student on the New Brunswick campus,"" McCormick said in the statement.

"Abuja, Ni(CNN) -- At least 18 people were killed in a bombing at a U.N. building in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, a police spokesman said Friday. Police commission Michael Zuokumo told reporters eight people had been injured. Rescue officials are at the scene helping to pull people from the rubble. Bomb squad officers and other security teams were sent to the scene, deputy police spokesman Yemi Ajayi said. A representative for the National Hospital said there was a shortage of blood to use in surgery. Hospital staff and relatives of the injured are currently going to the blood bank to donate. The hospital has called in all doctors and nurses who were not working Friday to deal with the emergency, the spokeswoman said, as ambulances brought people in. A witness outside the building at the time of the attack told CNN she had seen a white SUV drive through the main gate of the compound quickly. She then heard two explosions in quick succession, the second one much larger and followed by the shattering of glass, before running to safety. Alessandra Vellucci at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland confirmed that the ""U.N. premises in Abuja have been bombed"" but was unable to give more details. The building is home to the main U.N missions operating in Nigeria and may have had as many as 400 people inside. Eyewitnesses in the U.N. building told CNN there was an explosion, then an internal wall fell on some people, causing several casualties. Abdulkadir said it appeared that a car bomb had gone off at the front of the building, causing a wall to cave in. He said the area was not very busy because it was a diplomatic district, with the Liberian and U.S.embassies nearby, but that there were people working there. A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Abuja, Deborah MacLean, told CNN that there had been no damage to the embassy building, which is half a mile from the U.N building. Embassy personnel were initially told to be careful in case of further violence, she said. Zoran Jovanovic, head of mission for the International Red Cross in Abuja, said the explosion was heard at 10:15 a.m. local time. The U.N. building was in a large compound that had five gates, Jovanovic said, adding that the area was also home to western African embassies. It is not yet clear who was responsible for the attack. The Nigerian capital has seen a series of bombings recently. In June, a car blast killed at least five people at the police headquarters in the city. It detonated less than two minutes after the federal police chief entered the building, a security source said at the time. A month later, at least three people died in an explosion near a church outside the capital. The number of casualties could have been higher if services were still going on, according to a police spokesman. In October, at least 12 people died when car bombs exploded as the nation celebrated 50 years of independence. The attacks near the Justice Ministry injured about 50. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta claimed responsibility for the October attack. MEND, an umbrella organization of several rebel groups, is battling the government for fairer distribution of oil wealth. Recent attacks, including on the church and police station, may have been the work of a radical Muslim sect, Boko Haram, the nation's officials said this year. Boko Haram aims to enforce a strict version of Sharia law in the nation. Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north.

"(CNN) -- When Regis Philbin asked David Letterman about the difficult decision to return to the air less than a week after 9/11, the ""Late Show"" host said, ""I remember not wanting to go back, not feeling ready to go back, but knowing we had to go back. And you know -- my concerns were minimal compared to people who really suffered."" Philbin, sitting in for Piers Morgan, in his return to hosting after leaving ""Regis and Kelly"" gets Letterman to open up about fatherhood, politics, his career, his friendship with the late Johnny Carson and more. Letterman's ""Late Show"" guests on September 17, 2001, were Philbin and Dan Rather, and his completely joke-free monologue was solemnly delivered from behind his desk rather than the usual center stage. Letterman praised New York firefighters, police officers and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Of those who carried out the attacks, he said: ""We were told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervor, and if you live to be a thousand years old, will that make any sense to you?"" When Philbin asked Letterman to take him back to the beginning of his career, Letterman recalled falling behind in college until the semester he took a public speaking course at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. He referred to the class as a ""lifeline"" that made him realize he ""might be able to turn this into doing something."" Letterman graduated from Ball State in 1969 and six years later went to California to try to make it as a writer. He found success quickly, he told Philbin, ""not because of me. It was just in those days ... if you wanted to go to California and become a comic or get involved in comedy, writing, performing, whatever, the blueprint for that was laid out in front of you every night on 'The Tonight Show.' "" The show's host, Carson, often plugged comedians' appearances at the Comedy Store, and Letterman saw the famed Hollywood comedy club as ""an instant connection."" Three years later, in 1978, Letterman appeared on ""The Tonight Show."" On that appearance, Carson predicted great success for the young comedian, and Letterman, watching the old ""Tonight Show"" clip, told Philbin, ""That breaks my heart -- to see Johnny again."" Letterman recalled Carson's early influence on him. ""He was, I think, the biggest star in television. And I was just a kid who has followed ... the beacon of his light coming out of Burbank."" Letterman called Carson's friendship ""a tremendous blessing"" and said he made a point of telling him the way he felt. Letterman recalled the last time he saw Carson. ""The way life is,"" Letterman said, ""you don't know that that will be the last time, but it turned out to be the last time, and it couldn't have been a lovelier evening. And I cherish that because it was unusual. It was not going to happen under any other circumstances. And it was my wife, myself, Johnny and his wife on Johnny's yacht that he had anchored in the Hudson. ""And it was a Friday evening and we sailed off just before sunset and went up the Hudson, up under the George Washington Bridge, which is lovely, turned around, now the sun is setting. We go out to the Statue of Liberty and see that at night, as the sky is darkening. And then you turn around and we headed up the East River, and you see the lower tip of Manhattan , and it was a sight and an experience. ... You never get to see New York like that."" Carson passed away in 2005. Letterman has hosted ""Late Show With David Letterman"" on CBS for nearly 19 years. Before then, he hosted ""Late Night With David Letterman"" on NBC for 11 years. One staple of both shows -- the ""Top Ten"" list -- is still going strong. ""It was a cheap, easy way to refill a category and get some laughs most nights,"" Letterman said. When Philbin asked if coming up with the lists was ""a chore,"" the ""Late Show"" host joked, ""Not for me. ... I'm not even in the building. I'm an old man with a facial."" Letterman also said that his favorite guests -- besides Philbin, of course -- were ""people who really come and do a great job for us."" He counted Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Brian Williams, Tom Brokaw and Don Rickles among the ""handful of people who are really, really strong."" When Philbin brought up the fact that, in the past, talk-show hosts have avoided politics so as not to alienate their audiences, Letterman said, ""I have been guilty of appearing to be playing partisan politics. However, I'd just like to say that for the record, I am a registered independent."" Letterman insisted the material drives his jokes, and noted that ""no president that I am aware of got hammered harder than Bill -- President Bill Clinton -- over the Monica Lewinsky situation. We beat up on him. We still use him as a reference, and then we were desperate. We thought, 'Well, this was so easy' -- and then we got George Bush."" Letterman said that while he may appear to have a political agenda, it's simply a matter of who's easier to poke fun at. ""If a guy drops his dog or a guy straps his dog to the roof of a car or if a guy gets a shoe thrown at him, well, this is where the material is going to be,"" Letterman said. Philbin also asked Letterman about fatherhood. The comedian's son, Harry, is 8. ""Life is no longer solely about you,"" Letterman said. ""It's about him."" Philbin asked if Harry knew what his dad did for a living. ""No,"" the comedian joked, ""he thinks I have a job in a metal shop."" Letterman said he and his son took up skiing four years ago and very much enjoy the sport. Harry also loves animals, Letterman told Philbin, and likes to visit his father at work when ""Late Show"" does its ""Stupid Pet Tricks"" segment or has zookeeper Jack Hanna as a guest. When Philbin asked whether Harry was a ""mama's boy"" or a ""daddy's boy,"" Letterman answered, ""He's a mama's boy, for sure."" What's great about being the 65-year-old father of an 8-year-old? ""I'm old enough now where if I see trouble down the road, I'll probably be dead by then, and it will be his stepfather's problem."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN)  -- A controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday, said an independent research institute in Norway. Sen. Piedad Cordoba, right, of Colombia reportedly is one of three top contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize. Sen. Piedad Cordoba is the most likely recipient among three leading contenders, said the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute. The others the institute named are Jordanian Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a philosophy professor in Islamic faith at Jordan University, and Afghan physician and human rights activist Sima Samar. Though the institute considers Cordoba the front-runner, no single candidate has emerged as the clear-cut favorite, as sometimes happens, said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace institute. ""It really is quite open this year,"" Harpviken said. This year's peace prize nominees include 172 people and 33 organizations. The committee does not release the names of the nominees. The 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize. Harpviken said he believes the prize will go to an individual or organization engaged in the resolution of a protracted armed conflict. ""This is a [Nobel] committee that will perhaps be more proactive and will award somebody involved in a standing process rather than rewarding someone for past accomplishments,"" he said. Cordoba, 54, heads Colombians for Peace, a group trying to end to the 45-year-old war between the government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. Since 2007, she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the FARC and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more. Colombian officials have said the guerrillas are holding about 700 captives. A government critic and longtime peace activist, Cordoba was kidnapped by a right-wing paramilitary group in 1999. She was released after several weeks and then fled to Canada with her family, where she stayed for 14 months before returning home. There have been at least two assassinations attempts against her. ""While it is the hostage releases that have brought Cordoba and her organization the most attention, her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long-term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize,"" PRIO said in a release. Harpviken said he had received many complaints because of his prediction about Cordoba, whom critics accuse of being too close to the rebels. ""I do realize that this created some debate in Colombia,"" he said. ""That's not terribly surprising."" Cordoba was nominated by Argentinean human rights activist Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize. Harpviken said Muhammad, an Islamic scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths, also is a leading candidate. ""Certainly, the purpose ... he stands for makes him very strong,"" Harpviken said. A member of the Jordanian royal family and educated at Princeton and Cambridge universities, where he received a doctorate, Muhammad, 42, ""is playing an increasingly central role as an advocate of interfaith dialogue,"" PRIO said. In 2005, the prince brought together 170 Islamic scholars from 40 countries for the Amman Initiative to work out what they called a ""theological counter-attack against terrorism."" Two years later, Muhammad and other prominent Islamic scholars wrote a letter called ""A Common Word Between Us and You"" that urged mutual understanding and peace with Christians. The letter, PRIO said, was partly a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on Islam. Backing his words with his deeds, Muhammad gave what was considered a broadly accommodating welcoming speech when the pope visited Jordan this year. ""The importance of Prince Ghazi's initiatives to date lies first and foremost in the way he engages Islamic theology, institutions and leaders in a debate on the relationship between Islam and other faiths, thereby contributing a wider platform for interreligious dialogue for Muslims in general,"" PRIO said. ""A prize to Prince Ghazi would also be recognition of the long-standing efforts of the Jordanian royal family, including King Abdullah, who have been long-standing proponents of peace and reconciliation in the Middle East."" If Muhammad does not win, Harpviken said, it could be because his work is not done. ""He still has a way to go so that his ideas have an impact,"" Harpviken said. The third PRIO front-runner is Samar, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the U.N. special envoy to Darfur in Africa. A medical doctor, Samar also established the Shuhada Organization, which focuses on health care, particularly for Afghan women. After obtaining her medical degree in 1982, Samar and her son fled to Pakistan in 1984 when the communist regime then ruling Afghanistan arrested her husband. Samar, 52, remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration. ""She has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from Islamist radicals, and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women,"" PRIO said, adding that she ""does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process."" According to other published reports, another possible pick is monk Thich Quang Do, head of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam. He has been under house arrest since 2001 and has been in and out of jail since his first detention by communist authorities in 1977. Quang Do, 80, was awarded the annual human rights prize by the Rafto Foundation of Norway in 2006. Four recent Rafto winners have gone on to garner the Nobel Peace Prize: Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (also known as Burma), Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor, Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Shirin Ebadi of Iran. Azerbaijani journalist and human rights activist Malahat Nasibova was awarded the Rafto this year and also is considered a possible Nobel prize winner. Chinese dissidents Hu Jia, Gao Zhisheng and Wei Jingsheng also are contenders, other observers said. After months of house arrest, Hu, 36, was detained in December 2007 during a crackdown on dissidents and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in April 2008 for ""inciting subversion of state power."" Hu started his activism focusing on HIV/AIDS in 2001 and co-founded a grassroots organization dedicated to helping children from AIDS families. The international human rights group Amnesty International said Hu's focus broadened and he began reporting on a wider human rights violations in China, even giving interviews to international journalists. Amnesty said Hu has been repeatedly beaten and harassed by police for his outspokenness. Before being arrested, he had publicly expressed concerns over human rights abuses by police in Beijing. Gao, who was born in 1966, is a self-taught lawyer and People's Liberation Army veteran who was a Nobel Peace Prize candidate last year. He disappeared in February after being taken away by Chinese police. Fellow activists say he is believed to still be alive. In 2007, he wrote a letter to the U.S. Congress urging the United States to boycott the Olympic Games held in Beijing the following year. In it, he described a wide array of human rights violations by the Chinese government -- from lack of property and religious rights to environmental disasters to Tibet. ""I ask to you to seriously consider the true value of morality, justice, and humanity, as well as to what extent such values are undermined in China,"" he said. Wei, 59, was first arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years. He was released in 1993 but arrested again within six months and sentenced to 14 years. In 1997, Chinese authorities put him on a plane to the United States, where he has lived since. Perhaps the best known of the Chinese dissidents, Wei has been awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the National Endowment for Democracy Award and the Olof Palme Memorial Prize. He has been nominated seven times for the peace prize. Harpviken said he doubts the Nobel committee will choose any Chinese or Russian dissidents this year because they ""don't want to anger powerful governments."" ""Although the committee takes pride in being independent,"" he said, ""there are certain limitations on their being independent."" That does not mean he doesn't expect the committee to ""take daring decisions."" Harpviken said he believes that ""the most likely expression of the committee's courage this year will be to award the prize either to an unconventional kind of candidate or to somebody whose work is likely to be directly helped by a prize award."" The peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded. While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The Nobel recipient receives a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $1.4 million.

"(CNN)  -- Hurricane Paloma continued to intensify Friday night as the Category 3 storm pounded Grand Cayman island with strong winds and heavy rain. As of 10 p.m. ET Friday, Paloma was moving northeast through the Cayman Islands. The National Hurricane Center said additional strengthening of the storm could occur through Saturday night as Paloma turned northeast and headed toward Cuba. A hurricane warning was in effect Friday throughout the Cayman islands, with residents being told that ""preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the center said. A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected within 24 hours. Cuban officials also issued a hurricane warning for the provinces of Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey and Las Tunas, the Miami, Florida-based hurricane center said in an advisory. As of 10 p.m. ET, Paloma's winds were near 115 mph (185 kph) with higher gusts. Paloma is forecast to approach Cuba as a Category 2 storm after weakening late Saturday, according to the hurricane center.  Watch rainstorms beat the Cayman Islands » . Friday evening, the center of Paloma was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Grand Cayman Island and about 275 miles (443 kilometers) southwest of Camaguey, Cuba. It was moving northeast at about 7 mph and was expected to pass near Grand Cayman Friday night and approach the coast of central Cuba late Saturday, the hurricane center said. The storm's projected path would steer it away from the U.S. mainland and into the Atlantic.  See where the hurricane could be headed » . J.B. Webb, a manager at a radio station on Grand Cayman, said Friday evening that some residents had gone to shelters and others were shutting themselves in downtown businesses rebuilt to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. He said the local government had advised people to be off the roads by 11 a.m. The storm is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches over the Caymans and central and eastern Cuba, with isolated maximum totals of 15 inches possible. Flash floods and mudslides are possible, forecasters said. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 120 miles, the hurricane center said. iReport.com: Are you in Paloma's path? Forecasters predicted storm-surge flooding of 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels, accompanied by dangerous battering waves, near the center of Paloma in the Cayman Islands. Near where Paloma is expected to make landfall, along Cuba's southern coast, storm surge flooding of 8 to 12 feet is forecast, the hurricane center said. Cuban television was broadcasting advisories to viewers, telling them not to cross swollen rivers, to avoid fallen cables and to evacuate if told to do so by Civil Defense officials. In Las Tunas, students in boarding schools were sent home, because the schools will be used as shelters. Evacuations were under way in some coastal areas prone to flooding. Rice and cereal was being shipped to other parts of the country to keep it from spoiling, and no tourists were being allowed to enter many areas.

"(CNN) -- Screen-Free Week, the international, seven-day celebration of life beyond screen-based amusements, begins today. It's a great time to take a much-needed vacation from digital entertainment. Each year, often in conjunction with schools, organizations and whole communities, families exchange their usual screen-based leisure time activities for more time playing, creating, reading, dreaming, connecting with nature and enjoying family and friends. (Yes, we still have to use screens for work and homework.) If you can't celebrate this year, make it a point to join us in 2015. Taking a break gives us a chance to catch our breath, look at how much time we and our children spend with screens and perhaps even decide to make some important lifestyle changes. Many kids spend too much time with screens -- and it's not good for them. As a psychologist and director of an advocacy organization focused on children and families, I frequently speak to parents about the impact of media and technology on young children. What I hear repeatedly is that the recent explosion of screen devices raises increasingly complicated challenges. Digital media are so compelling, exciting and omnipresent that it's getting harder to figure out how, when and even whether to set limits. Adding to the confusion is the ubiquitous and persuasive marketing of screen products as educational for young children -- even for babies -- and that digital media are a often a surefire way for overstressed parents to keep their children occupied. Screens are a fact of 21st-century life, and kids find them entrancing. Why should we set limits or deprive young children of digital experiences? One compelling reason is that excessive screen time is linked to a host of childhood problems, including poor school performance, attention issues, sleep disturbance, obesity and more. That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends discouraging screen time for children younger than 2 and setting limits on time and content for older children. Because the explosion of smart phones and tablets is so new, most of the research on harmful effects is associated with television, but emerging studies are beginning to raise concerns about time with all kinds of digital media. At the same time, research suggests that monitoring time and content can mitigate some of screen media's negative effects. As kids get older, setting limits becomes more challenging, but it's still important. By adolescence, if not before, digital technologies are often completely integrated into homework assignments, connecting with friends and gathering information about the world. That's why many families make sure to preserve screen-free family meals or institute at least one night a week when, except for homework, they all ditch their devices and spend time engaged in other activities. Since it's much easier to increase children's time with screens rather than take it away, it's helpful to recognize the need to make thoughtful decisions about media use early on. What do our youngest children actually learn from digital media? One thing they may learn is to need screens for stimulation and soothing. For better or worse, the roots of lifelong habits and behaviors form in early childhood. The experiences we have in our first years of life -- and the experiences we don't have -- shape the very structure of our brains. Limited time with quality screen media and technology can be educational for preschoolers. But digital devices are by no means essential to their learning. As for babies and toddlers, the more time children younger than 2 spend with screens, the more time they spend as older children and the harder time they have turning them off. Despite unsubstantiated corporate marketing claims that apps can teach babies as young as 6 months numbers and letters, there's no evidence that infants and toddlers learn anything meaningful from any kind of screen time. There is plenty of evidence about what they need for healthy brain development -- hands-on play, active play and face-to-face engagement with the adults who love them. Babies thrive when they're talked to, played with and read to. Time with screens takes them away from those crucial activities. What's most important for babies, preschoolers and even kindergartners is to learn how to learn. They need the time, space and silence for hands-on creative play. They need to explore the world with all their senses, to nurture their creativity and constructive problem solving and to learn social skills to build the ability to work and play with other people. They need to acquire patience, develop stamina and be able to delay gratification. They need to learn to act, rather than merely react. They need to learn to generate their own amusements and to enjoy and value their own creations. Young children can't learn most of these skills and attributes effectively from a screen. In fact, most of what very young children encounter on a screen today inhibits rather than promotes the kind of creative problem solving so essential to learning. Makers of new digital media for young children distance their products from video and television by marketing so-called educational apps and games as ""interactive,"" but a 2012 Australian study found that only 2% of the apps marketed as education for young children promote the kind of open-ended exploration that fosters learning. For parents worried about the strain of limiting digital entertainment, Screen-Free Week is a good time to experiment and see what it's like to replace screen entertainment with other activities. After all, it's only seven days. You might enjoy it -- most people do. What are rules around screen time in your household or your children's school?

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber became an unprecedented sixth different winner in six races this season as he drove his Red Bull to victory at the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix Sunday. Webber made the most of starting from pole position to hold off Nico Rosberg in the Mercedes with Fernando Alonso taking third for Ferrari to take over at the top of the world title standings. Webber's Red Bull teammate and two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel finished a fine fourth after starting ninth on the grid. Both Alonso and Vettel moved ahead of a disappointed Lewis Hamilton during their pit stops, leaving the McLaren driver in fifth spot. Felipe Massa was sixth in the second Ferrari. Briton Paul di Resta drove a fine race to finish seventh, just ahead of his Force India teammate German Nico Hulkenberg. Finn Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus and Brazilian Bruno Senna in his Williams completed the points scoring. It was the third straight Monaco win for Red Bull, who extended their lead in the constructors' standings over McLaren. Webber, who also won in 2010, was claiming his eighth Formula One career victory and he moved level with Vettel into joint second in the standings, three points adrift of Alonso. ""I feel incredible,"" Webber told the official post-race press conference. ""It was a very interesting race, reasonably straightforward at the start, just managing the gap to Nico (Rosberg). ""I'm really glad to have won here again, a great victory for me."" It was another disappointing race day for seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who had been the fastest in qualifying. A five-place grid penalty left the Mercedes driver starting from sixth and an early tangle with Romain Grosjean (Lotus), who was forced to retire, saw him slip back to eighth. A technical problem later hit Schumacher to leave him pointless again. The race was held against the backdrop of the constant threat of a rain shower, which could have seen a complete change in the finishing order. The rain eventually came with a vengeance after the finish, leaving Webber to breath a sigh of relief. Alonso was also a big winner on the day, with Ferrari making great strides after being off the pace earlier in the season. ""For me, the target was to try to finish in front of Sebastian and Lewis (Hamilton) as they are with us in the championship. If you go race by race, you aim to finish ahead of different drivers. ""Now it is Mark (Webber). It will be interesting, as we are constantly developing the car and we are constantly surprised at every race.""

"(CNN) -- Brent Larson and his bride, Ona, look like an ad for their Antigua resort, glowing, in love and sun-kissed in paradise. The picture doesn't tell the whole story. Larson, a CNN iReporter, said the resort had no record of the couple's reservation for the honeymoon suite, leaving them half-asleep in the lobby until the middle of the night. The private beach? Not so private, with wandering drug dealers who didn't take kindly to the U.S. Naval Academy graduate and his wife declining their products. ""The Antigua pics being quite different than the story was an accident,"" said Larson of Charlotte, North Carolina. ""I wish I had pics of the (possibly human) bone fragment (I found on the beach), the cop giving me a hard time when I reported it, the massive storm that flooded St. John's and stranded me there for three hours while my wife thought I'd been kidnapped for ransom, and on and on."" It might have been the vacation from hell, but it seems that any trip can be turned into a great tale with amazing pictures. Inspired by the true stories behind picture-perfect photos, we asked CNN's iReporters to share their dream vacation photos and the real stories behind them. Almost everyone had amazing and sometimes horrifying stories that the camera didn't catch. 10 budget friendly all-inclusive resorts . They didn't let illness ruin their trip . Donna Henderson, another iReporter, had hoped for lovely times with her mother during a three-week vacation through Iceland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands and Italy. Her aunt joined them for part of the trip. It didn't go as planned. Less than a week after they arrived, her mother got a cough that turned into a viral chest infection. A few days later, her aunt had a heart attack. Henderson started to feel sick the next day and visited a hospital emergency room just to make sure she was OK. The special night out she planned for her mother's birthday, including a dinner cruise down the Seine River? They didn't make it. Despite their illnesses, Henderson doesn't dwell on the negative aspects of the trip when she looks through her pictures. ""One of the best things for me was to spend about a week and a half with my aunt and get to know her from the perspective of an adult,"" wrote Henderson, an Ottawa, Canada resident, in an e-mail. ""The trip to the Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon (in Iceland) was amazing and worth the entire 13.5 hours it took us, as we did it as a day trip,"" she wrote. ""My mum, who was born in Scotland, had always wanted to see Fingal's Cave and was finally able to do so. That was good for her to see it and for me to be the one to take her."" Five beautiful bike trips . Attack of the killer sand flies . Adam Parker, an iReporter from Decatur, Georgia, loves to take pictures and was immediately drawn toward Barbuda, ""a little jewel of an island where we could have some scenic solitude"" for his honeymoon. The happy couple knew that they wouldn't have air conditioning, which wouldn't have been a problem if sand fly season hadn't started earlier than usual. ""My wife would like me to clarify that we didn't just itch a little from bugs,"" he added. ""We actually spent most nights getting to sleep with her on the couch and me in the other room because we fell asleep whenever we became too exhausted to stay awake."" The highlight of the trip? Visiting the island's only hospital in search of relief from the itching. ""The hospital was an old, barely staffed facility in which half of the equipment used was outdated and/or rusted,"" he wrote. ""She chose to take antihistamine in pill form as opposed to getting a shot because we couldn't help but question the sterility of the environment."" He said, ""Now almost exactly a year later the memory of the biting pests has faded for me, not so much for my wife, and we are left with pictures that would make it hard to believe that we were treated to anything less than paradise during our first week of marriage."" Time doesn't blur the memories . While photos usually gloss over the back story, they're great for calling up those cherished, if not picture-perfect, family memories. Seattle iReporter Jim McClure and his wife recently scanned a collection of family camping trip photos from 20 years ago to create photo books for their grown children, now 24 and 28. Looking through pictures of the Canadian and Colorado Rockies, the Badlands, the Oregon and Washington coasts and the San Juan Islands sparked many memories not documented in the collection. McClure can clearly remember his daughter, ""at age 5 sitting, arms folded and crying because she was having difficulty setting up her tent, or the moose that wouldn't let me out of the campground shower building for several minutes."" ""My son and daughter set up and slept in their own tents, starting at a very young age. Everyone pitched in, from gathering fire wood to preparing meals to cleaning up. We were lucky to see and experience many wonderful things. We all remember our meals, some of the best food (ever) cooked over the fire."" The photo books were a hit with his kids during a recent family celebration. ""They were completely surprised,"" he wrote. ""The day's celebrations basically stopped while they slowly flipped through the books."" McClure said he's also grateful that his 90-year-old father is dedicated to reviewing and scanning his collection of photos that date back to McClure's great-grandparents' days. ""Every image tells a story, some short -- some longer,"" he wrote. ""It's not uncommon for an e-mail trail to go on for weeks, becoming pages long, containing the discussions these images conjure up from the recipients."" The pictures offer some perspective . iReporter Jim Heston was taking a day trip to Dala, across the Yangon River in Myanmar, when the skies decided to open up. As Heston ducked into a small shelter along the river to stay dry, children began to play in the rain, and an amazing photo opportunity presented itself. ""In the tropics, the people deal with the rain as a minor inconvenience, and don't let it hinder their mobility,"" he wrote. ""From the vantage point of the shelter, I was able to snap off pictures of people coming and going through the intersection."" He added, ""I made it to one more vantage point, an open restaurant near the ferry drop-off. This was a very vibrant spot as people arriving from the Yangon side, were on their way home. They weren't concerned about being drenched as they were getting close to home."" One man's washout is another's photo opp. And the rest of the world just goes about its business.

Everyone is in August. They should admit it,' Daily Caller . editor and Fox commentator Tucker Carlson said. 'I hope the new Ambassador has a really good reason for her absence. Secret trip for UN business? Good reasons I understand,' Fox host Greta Van Susteren wrote on her blog. While she would not have been able to fly back to the United States in time for the emergency meeting, a deputy attended in her place and she is reportedly staying briefed. Wednesday's attack in Syria is believed to have been caused by chemical weapons but it is not certain as United Nations weapons inspectors have not been allowed in the country. Death toll: Hundreds died in the alleged chemical attacks, including many women and children . The headcount from the attack- which appears to have included many women and children- is thought to be more than 100 people and all told more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the start of the country's civil war. It comes as little surprise that Ms Power is an advocate for global action as the majority of her work and expertise has centered around the study of genocide. She has written books and participated in documentaries about the genocides in Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Armenia and Darfur.

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Two young children have emerged as heroes after warning others of a gunman on a rampage at their Sikh house of worship in suburban Milwaukee. Abhay Singh, 11, and his sister, Amanat, 9, were sitting outside the gurdwara Sunday morning when the shooter, identified as Wade Michael Page, first opened fire on two people. ""We ran as fast as we could inside to warn everybody in the kitchen and everybody else there is a man outside with a gun,"" Abhay -- whose name means ""fearless"" -- told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday. ""We were a little bit scared."" The children said they hid with others in a pantry after sounding the alarm. Their mother, Kanwal Singh, and father had told them to stay inside while they went to a store to get supplies for a meal at the gurdwara. But the children said the inside was hot. The horrified parents could not immediately reach the children. Shooting victims put others first . ""We were worried and praying like hopefully we will see them again,"" KanwalSingh said. The FBI, meanwhile, said Wednesday that Page died from a self-inflicted wound to the head and not from a shot fired by a responding officer. Police previously said Page died after being shot by the officer. That shot in the stomach was potentially fatal, but Page died from the self-inflicted wound, said Teresa Carlson, special agent in charge for the FBI in Milwaukee. Carlson revealed few other details about the investigation of Sunday's shooting in Oak Creek. Six people were killed. She said that no clear motive has been established and that Misty Cook, Page's former girlfriend who was arrested Sunday on an unrelated weapons charge, is probably not linked to the shooting. ""We do not believe she had anything to do with it,"" Carlson said. After authorities went to Cook's home to interview her, she was charged with possessing a gun, which is illegal because she is a felon. Page, a 40-year-old Army veteran who neighbors say played in a so-called hate-rock band, was the lone gunman, Carlson said. Police have not found any notes or other clues as to why Page went on a killing spree at the Oak Creek temple, and his family members have not reported observing warning signs. ""This is a guy who moved around a lot,"" Carlson said. ""We are zeroing in on any possible motives, but right now, we don't have one."" Authorities have conducted more than 100 interviews nationwide with people including Page's family members, associates and neighbors, she said. They also are reviewing his e-mails and other electronic records. The investigation continued as a community reeled from the carnage. Explainer: Who are Sikhs? For a fourth consecutive night, mourners held vigils Wednesday to remember the dead and pray for the wounded. One gathering was held near the White House. Many of the estimated 200 or so people wore ribbons colored orange and blue to symbolize the identity of the Sikh community. Many wrote notes on a sign that had the names of the victims and read ""United Against Hate."" The sign will be sent to the Wisconsin temple. Authorities received tips that Page might have links to the white supremacist movement, but nothing has been confirmed, according to Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards and the FBI. Officials said that the 9 mm semiautomatic handgun with multiple ammunition magazines used by the attacker had been legally purchased. According to a man who described himself as Page's old Army buddy, the attacker talked about ""racial holy war"" when they served together in the 1990s. Christopher Robillard of Oregon, who said he lost contact with Page more than a decade ago, added that when Page would rant, ""it would be about mostly any non-white person."" Page, born on Veterans Day in 1971, joined the Army in 1992 and left the service in 1998, according to Army spokesman George Wright. The Sikh turban: At one personal and extremely personal . Page's service was marked by ""patterns of misconduct,"" and he received a general discharge because of ""discreditable incidents,"" according to a Pentagon official. Robillard said Page was pushed out for showing up to formation drunk. An Iowa-based trucking company, which employed Page from April 2006 to August 2010, said it fired him as a driver for violating company policy regarding impaired driving, which also applied to personal vehicles. Barr-Nunn Transportation, in a statement Monday, said Page was dismissed after he received an impaired-driving citation in North Carolina while driving a personal vehicle on his own time. ""Additional documentation indicates he refused to submit to a chemical analysis to determine alcohol concentration or presence of an impairing substance at the time of the citation,"" the company said. Page lived in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for several years. He owned a modest house on a country road, but he ran into financial trouble and the home was foreclosed on, according to Wells Fargo bank. John Tew, manager of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle store in Fayetteville, told CNN he fired Page from his parts coordinator job in 2004 because Page ""had a big problem with authority"" and with working with women. Tew said he found an application for the Ku Klux Klan on Page's desk the day he was dismissed. Two neighbors of Page identified him in photos that showed him playing in the far-right punk band ""End Apathy"" with Nazi flags hanging near him. The six victims of Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur.

"(CNN) -- FIFA has moved quickly to deny claims its president, Sepp Blatter, suggested Qatar is unfit to host the 2022 World Cup -- despite his admission that it was ""a mistake"" to schedule a summer tournament in the Gulf State. Blatter, who oversees the game's global governing body, appeared to cast doubt over Qatar's right to welcome the football world, following an interview with a Swiss television station Friday. When asked by RTS if it was an error to award Qatar the World Cup, Blatter said: ""Of course, it was a mistake. You know, one makes a lot of mistakes in life. ""The technical report indicated clearly that it was too hot in summer, but despite that the executive committee decided, with quite a big majority, that the tournament would be in Qatar."" In October 2013, Blatter set up an executive committee taskforce to examine whether the World Cup in Qatar should be switched to winter because of extreme summer temperatures. A decision is expected to be made following the conclusion of the upcoming World Cup in Brazil. Blatter's comments sparked a frenzy on social media and led to criticism of the 78-year-old and the organization's decision to award the tournament to Qatar. But speaking to CNN, a FIFA spokesman said: ""The comment by the FIFA President concerning the organization of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar to Swiss TV station RTS is in line with previous comments on this matter. "" As explained in his answer to the journalist, the president reiterated that the decision to organize the World Cup in summer was an 'error' based on the technical assessment report of the bid, which had highlighted the extremely hot temperatures in summer in Qatar. ""At no stage did he question Qatar as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup."" Harold Mayne-Nicholls led the FIFA inspection team which examined each of the bidding countries for the 2022 World Cup before delivering his report in October 2010. Mayne-Nicholls concluded that Qatar was a high-risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in December that year. ""In June and July you cannot play,"" Mayne-Nicholls told CNN last November when asked about the conditions in Qatar. ""It's not for the players. The players will be OK with the cooling system but what about the fans? ""You'll have 50,000 fans walking three, four, even six blocks or more like in South Africa where I walked 10 blocks. ""They will be walking in 40 degrees and it's too much. One or two crucial cases will damage the entire image of the World Cup and we must be careful."" If the World Cup was to be held between November and January, it would probably create a logistical headache for many major European leagues -- such as the English Premier League -- and for the prestigious Champions League, organized by the continent's UEFA confederation. American broadcaster Fox, which paid $425 million for the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, has expressed concern that a ""winter"" World Cup could clash with the National Football League's regular season and the Super Bowl. The decision to award Qatar football's showpiece event has drawn widespread condemnation and focused attention on workers' rights in the state. A report released by Amnesty International last November alleged that the abuse of migrant workers was rife within Qatar's construction sector, while British newspaper The Guardian likened the conditions for such workers to ""modern-day slavery."" The furor which surrounded ""stranded"" footballer Zahir Belounis also raised questions regarding Qatar's Kafala law. Blatter himself described the conditions for migrant workers in Qatar as ""unacceptable,"" but has so far refused to entertain the idea of moving the 2022 competition to another location. In response to Amnesty's allegations, the director of the Human Rights Department at Qatar's Foreign Ministry said laws are in place to protect workers from mistreatment.","FIFA denies Sepp Blatter said Qatar unfit to hold World Cup .

"Russia has said it is outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine and blamed a far-right paramilitary movement for 'conniving' with the new government in Kiev. In . its latest salvo in a propaganda war over Ukraine, in which the U.S. has issued a list of what it calls 10 false claims by President Vladimir . Putin, Russia accused the West of being silent over violence and . detentions taking place there against Russian compatriots. The foreign ministry said in a statement masked men from the Right Sector had opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the eastern city of Kharkiv on March 8, wounding some. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama arrive at the White House on Sunday following a trip to Florida. On Wednesday the President will hold discussions with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk about how to peacefully resolve Russia's military intervention in Crimea . Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk will travel to get support from the U.S. concerning his country's growing conflict . It . also said seven Russian journalists had been detained in the eastern . city of Dnipropetrovsk, suggesting the new leaders and their Western . allies were not committed to media freedoms. 'The . shamefaced silence of our Western partners, human rights organisations . and foreign media is surprising. It raises the question - where is the . notorious objectivity and commitment to democracy?' it said. Kharkiv . police are treating the Kharkiv incident as a minor one and say the . only link to Right Sector came from an anonymous phone caller.

Unmarked soldiers, believed to be Russian, stand guard near the Crimean city of Simferopol . Obama held two lengthy phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past week. Putin told Obama that ethnic Russians in Crimea needed protection from attacks by Ukrainian nationalists. The government in Kiev, he said, was illegal, and Russia¿s actions to defend them were completely legitimate . Crimea's pro-Russian prime minister will give people living there the choice of taking Russian or Ukrainian passports if the Ukrainian territory becomes part of Russia in a March 16 referendum, it was reported today . Sergei Aksyonov, who declared himself provincial leader almost two weeks ago after Russians seized the parliament building, told the Russian news agency that Crimea would also encourage the use of two languages - Russian and Crimean Tatar. Crimea's two million population, the focus of an increasingly bitter struggle for influence in Ukraine between East and West, has a narrow ethnic Russian majority but also includes more than 250,000 indigenous Tatars, who have returned since the 1980s after being deported by Stalin. They oppose Russian annexation. 'We will not insist on the necessity of returning Ukrainian passports,' Aksyonov said. 'Everyone will have the opportunity to develop their own language. We do not want to limit the Crimean Tatars.' She said . pro-Russian authorities who have seized power in Crimea were clamping . down on media that did not support them and were intimidating reporters. Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama began a new week of diplomatic consultations on the Ukraine crisis with a phone call to Chinese President Xi Jinping that focused on a peaceful solution to Russia's military intervention. Obama, who is to meet Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk at the White House on Wednesday, is seeking ways to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to loosen Russia's grip on the Crimea region of southern Ukraine. Mr Yatseniuk will address the United Nations Security Council about the situation in Crimea on Thursday. He was also quoted as saying he believed Russia, whose forces are in control of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, sought to 'undermine the foundations of global security and revise the outcome of World War Two.' Obama spoke to Xi on Sunday night. China is a key ally of Russia and has heightened tensions with Japan by declaring an air defense zone over remote islands claimed by both countries in the East China Sea. A White House statement released on Monday gave little detail as to what was discussed between Obama and Xi, saying the two leaders agreed on the 'importance of upholding principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, both in the context of Ukraine and also for the broader functioning of the international system.' 'The president noted his overriding objective of restoring Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensuring the Ukrainian people are able to determine their own future without foreign interference,' the White House said. Obama engaged in various diplomatic conversations over the weekend in the search for a solution to the crisis. Last week Crimea's pro-Moscow parliament voted to stage a March 16 referendum to determine whether the region should be annexed by Russia. The White House on Sunday said more international pressure on Russia would result if the Crimea vote proceeded. 'If there is an annexation of Crimea, a referendum that moves Crimea from Ukraine to Russia, we won't recognize it, nor will most of the world,' deputy White House national security adviser Tony Blinken told CNN. Supporters of Ukraine yell at pro- Russian protesters during a rally in Simferopol, capital of Crimea . As the standoff between the Russian military and Ukrainian forces continues in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, world leaders are pushing for a diplomatic solution to the escalating situation . Participants hold placards and shout slogans during an anti-war rally in the Crimean village of Eskisaray, outside Simferopol . Vice . President Joe Biden cut short his trip to Latin America, nixing a . planned stop in the Dominican Republic so he can attend Wednesday's . meeting, an aide to Biden said. Biden . had been the White House's prime point of contact with Ukraine's . president, Viktor Yanukovich, before he fled to Russia last month . following violent clashes in Kiev. Obama's . White House meeting with Yatsenyuk will focus on options to peacefully . resolve Russia's military intervention in the Ukrainian region of . Crimea, the White House said, adding that the resolution must respect . Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. By inviting Yatsenyuk, whose government . Russian President Vladimir Putin alleged took power by way of an . unconstitutional coup, the U.S. is also sending a clear signal to Moscow . that the U.S. considers Yatsenyuk to be Ukraine's legitimate leader — . at least for the time being. 'What . we've seen is the president mobilizing the international community in . support of Ukraine to isolate Russia for its actions in Ukraine, and to . reassure our allies and partners,' said Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy . national security adviser, as he announced the meeting Sunday on NBC's . Meet the Press. The . announcement came as the Kremlin was beefing up its military presence in . Crimea ahead of a planned March 16 referendum on whether Crimea should . break way from Ukraine and join Russia. Putin defended the separatist drive . as in keeping with international law, but Yatsenyuk vowed not to . relinquish 'a single centimeter' of his country's territory.

"Pope Francis extended an invitation Sunday to the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to travel to the Vatican for a ""peace initiative,"" after earlier calling for a two-state solution to the intractable conflict. The pontiff's remarks came at the end of an outdoor Mass in Bethlehem's Manger Square on the second day of his three-day trip to the Middle East. ""In this, the birthplace of the Prince of Peace, I wish to invite you, President Mahmoud Abbas, together with Israeli President Shimon Peres, to join me in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace,"" Francis said. ""I offer my home in the Vatican as a place for this encounter of prayer."" He added, ""Building peace is difficult, but living without peace is a constant torment. The men and women of these lands, and of the entire world, all of them, ask us to bring before God their fervent hopes for peace."" The Palestinian side has accepted the invitation and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will go to the Vatican, a Palestinian Legislative Council member, Hanan Ashrawi, told CNN. The Israeli President's office said that he welcomed the invitation. ""President Peres has always supported, and will continue to support, any attempts to progress the cause of peace,"" his office said. Pope Francis then traveled on to Tel Aviv, where in remarks on the airport tarmac to Peres and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he again issued an invitation to pray for peace at the Vatican. He also reiterated the Vatican's support for Israel's right to exist in peace and security. The next stop on his historic trip was Jerusalem. Two states . Earlier, speaking alongside Abbas in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Francis called for the recognition of a Palestinian state -- but he made the same demand on behalf of the state of Israel. He urged ""the acknowledgment by all of the right of two states to exist and to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders."" The Pope called on all sides to pursue a path to peace together and not take unilateral actions to disrupt it. ""I can only express my profound hope that all will refrain from initiatives and actions which contradict the stated desire to reach a true agreement, and that peace will be pursued with tireless determination and tenacity,"" he said. Middle East peace talks recently stalled despite high-profile efforts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to push them forward. The government of Israel has objected to unilateral initiatives by Palestinians to seek international recognition as a state, and Palestinians have objected to Israeli initiatives to expand settlements on the West Bank. Protecting Christians . In his remarks in Bethlehem, Francis called on Abbas to protect the religious rights of Palestinian Catholics. The Vatican has expressed concern over the emigration of Palestinian Christians. The pontiff also took a stand for the poor, suffering under tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. ""Even in the absence of violence, the climate of instability and a lack of mutual understanding have produced insecurity, the violation of rights, isolation and the flight of entire communities, conflicts, shortages and sufferings of every sort,"" he said. After meeting with Abbas, Francis cruised in the Popemobile through a crowd of hundreds of Catholic faithful and onlookers gathered in Manger Square as they awaited the papal Mass. Priests and the faithful swayed to religious music, while many waved red, green, black and white Palestinian flags and others yellow and white Vatican flags. The Pope hopped off the Popemobile to shake hands with people in the crowd. In a symbolically charged moment, he also stopped the vehicle to cross over to the separation barrier erected by Israel, its surface daubed with graffiti including the words ""Free Palestine!"" There, arm outstretched, he touched the concrete wall, his head apparently bowed in prayer. Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestine National Initiative, told CNN, ""The Pope did not only put his hand on a concrete wall. He put his hand on occupation. He put his hand on (an) apartheid system, on a system of separation, and discrimination, and oppression."" Refugee children make appeal . Francis also met with a group of Palestinian refugee children while in the West Bank. As they entered, the children held up signs about the occupation of Palestinian territories, typed in Arabic, Italian and English. ""Muslims and Christians live under the occupation,"" read one. Another said, ""I have never been to the sea!"" in an apparent reference to the restrictions on movement under which Palestinians live. After the children sang and presented him with gifts, the Pope responded in his native tongue, Spanish, to say he had heard their message. ""Never let the past determine your lives,"" he said. ""Violence is not overcome by violence. Violence is overcome by peace."" While in Jerusalem, Francis will meet with Bartholomew, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. His visit to the region commemorates the 50th anniversary of the landmark meeting between Pope Paul VI and the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians at the time, Patriarch Athenagoras, in Jerusalem. The pope will also meet the city's grand mufti and chief rabbis, visit the Western Wall and Yad Vashem, a memorial to the Holocaust, and lay a wreath on the grave of the founder of modern Zionism, Theodor Herzl. The Holy Land visit is the first for Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and just the fourth for any pontiff in the modern era. 'Urgent' solution needed to Syrian crisis . On the first day of his trip, Francis also gave a message of unity as he celebrated Mass at a stadium in Amman, Jordan -- a majority Muslim nation with a significant Christian community. In his homily, Francis spoke of the need for tolerance and diversity and urged everyone to put aside grievances and divisions. ""The mission of the Holy Spirit is to beget harmony ... and to create peace in different situations and between different people,"" he said. ""Let us ask the Spirit to prepare our hearts to encounter our brothers and sisters so that we may overcome our differences rooted in political thinking, language, culture and religion."" Christian refugees from Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian territories were among those present, and 1,400 children received their First Communion at the Mass. The Pope's trip to the Holy Land has been billed as a ""pilgrimage for prayer,"" with its roots in faith, not politics. But in a region where religion and politics are so closely intertwined, his every remark takes on an added significance. The pontiff is traveling with two friends -- a rabbi, Abraham Skorka, and a Muslim, Sheikh Omar Abboud, who leads Argentina's Muslim community. The Vatican has said their presence is symbolic of his call for unity. The Pope's first stop was at al-Husseini Royal Palace in Amman, where he met with Jordan's King Abdullah II. In televised remarks after that meeting, Francis paid tribute to Jordan's efforts to promote interfaith tolerance and to the welcome that the small nation has given to Palestinian refugees and, more recently, those fleeing war-torn Syria. Francis said it was ""necessary and urgent"" that a peaceful solution is found to the crisis in Syria. While in Jordan, Francis met some of the 600,000 Syrians who have fled since the start of the civil war in 2011, as well as refugees from Iraq. He also visited the River Jordan, where many Christians believe Jesus was baptized. Everything to know about Pope Francis .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The heads of state of Russia, China and four Central Asian partner nations signed a statement Thursday opposing outside intervention in Syria and Iran. ""We believe any attempts to resolve the Iranian issue by force are unacceptable,"" the statement from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization read. ""Such attempts could lead to unpredictably serious consequences, which would threaten stability and security in the region and the entire world."" The heads of state of the other member nations, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who attended the meeting hosted in Beijing, also signed the statement. On Syria, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization statement was less blunt, calling for ""dialogues that respect Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."" But on Wednesday, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao had stronger words about Syria, once more presenting a united front on the crisis that stands in opposition to tough measures discussed by Western powers. ""Both sides firmly oppose any attempt to resolve the Syrian crisis through foreign military intervention as well as promoting forced 'regime change' at the U.N. Security Council and other venues,"" the two presidents said. Instead, they reiterated support for the mediation efforts of U.N. special envoy Kofi Annan and called on all parties in the conflict to stop violence and engage in dialogue. As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia have veto powers and are important players in the Syrian conflict, having vetoed draft resolutions that called for sanctions against the Syrian regime. In February, they vetoed a draft resolution calling on President Bashar al-Assad to step down, claiming it lacked balance. And last Friday, they both vetoed a U.N. resolution condemning last month's massacre in Houla. The vetoes drew criticism from the Syrian opposition and Western powers. Pressure has been mounting on China and Russia to use their influence on Syria and join efforts led by the United States to impose more sanctions on the al-Assad government and force it to step down. Last Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton urged China and Russia to be ""part of the solution in Syria"" by backing a political transition from the al-Assad regime. Based on the tone of the joint statement, observers say it seems unlikely that China and Russia are going to change their positions on Syria anytime soon. This year, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization granted Afghanistan ""observer status"" in its organization. In its closing statement, it called for the country to become ""an independent, neutral, peaceful and prosperous nation.""","Russia and China display a united front on Syria and Iran .

"(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag smashed a career-best one-day innings of 175 as India opened the 2011 Cricket World Cup with a convincing 87-run victory over co-hosts Bangladesh in Dhaka on Saturday. Opening batsman Sehwag put on 203 for the third wicket with Virat Kohli, who was unbeaten on 100, as India compiled 370-4 in the allotted 50 overs -- the fifth-highest total in tournament history. Bangladesh made a game effort in reply but could manage only 283-9, crucially losing five wickets while scoring just 47 runs in the final 10 overs of the match. Sehwag, who hit 14 boundaries and five sixes in his 140-ball knock, matched the 175 not out by compatriot Kapil Dev in 1983 which is the fourth-highest score in World Cup matches. Bangladesh excited to host Cricket World Cup . ""It was a good start for the team, I have said this is a revenge game and we have won,"" the 32-year-old told reporters. ""I have said before Bangladesh are not good in Tests, but they can compete in ODIs -- but today they could not. Special thanks to my physio for helping me, I was carrying a couple of injuries and they got me ready for this game."" After Bangladesh won the toss and chose to field, Sehwag opened the Indian innings with veteran Sachin Tendulkar -- the sport's highest scorer in one-day and Test formats -- who scored 28 from 29 balls before being run out. Girls got game in cricket-crazy Bangladesh . Gautam Gambhir, who usually opens for India in five-day Tests, made a run-a-ball 39 before falling at 152-2 in the 24th over, bringing Koli to the crease. The 22-year-old reached three figures for the fourth time in one-day internationals, needing only 83 deliveries as he hit eight fours and two sixes. Bangladesh looked well-placed at 188-2 but then opener Tamil Iqbal fell for his team's top score of 70 as the second of Munaf Patel's four wickets. And when captain Shakib Al Hasan was caught in the deep by Harbhajan Singh for 55 off 50 balls in the 40th over, it signaled the end of the home team's resistance. Spinner Harbhajan picked up a wicket and a runout, while Patel finished with figures of 4-48 off his 10 overs to give India a winning start to their Group B campaign. The seven-team pool also includes cricket heavyweights South Africa, England and the West Indies. The Group A schedule begins on Sunday as New Zealand take on African minnows Kenya in Chennai, India, and the third of the tournament's hosts Sri Lanka play Canada.

"(CNN)  -- A pair of giant trimarans are battling for line honors in the Rolex Fastnet Race, one of yachting's classic offshore races. Loick Peyron's Maxi Banque Populaire was leading fellow French entry, the Seb Josse-skippered Gitana 11, by eight nautical miles as they rounded Fastnet Rock off south-west Ireland and headed for the finish in Plymouth in south-west England. Maxi Banque Populaire is considered the world's fastest offshore boat with massive 140-foot long hulls, much bigger than the 77-feet of Gitana 11, so the relatively small gap between the two was a surprise. At Fastnet rock, which was reached early on Monday morning, there is approximately 250 miles to the finish. The two leaders were being tracked by trimarans Veolia Environnement of France and Switzerland's Race for Water, which has round the world yachtswoman Dee Caffari as a key crew member. A record fleet of 314 starters set sail from Cowes on the Isle of Wight Sunday, battling it out for overall and handicap honors in their various classes. Rolex Fastnet Race official website . Peyron and his team reached The Needles within an hour, sailing at speeds of over 20 knots. It is the largest fleet since the 303 in the ill-fated 1979 race when the competitors were caught up in a vicious storm and 15 died. Restrictions on the size of the fleet were introduced in the wake of that tragedy. The Fastnet Race is the Royal Ocean Racing Club's flagship event and held every two years. The 608-mile course goes along the south coast of England, across the Celtic Sea to the Fastnet Rock before returning around the Scilly Isles to the finish in Plymouth.

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray became the first member of the so-called Big Four in men's tennis to flinch at the U.S. Open. He lost a set to Argentina's Leonardo Mayer on Friday. But the defending men's champion in New York had an easier time in sweltering conditions Sunday, dispatching German Florian Mayer 7-6 6-2 6-2 to move into the fourth round. Women's defending champion Serena Williams progressed, too, defeating Sloane Stephens 6-4 6-1 in a rematch of their thriller at the Australian Open. Even though Murray's serve wasn't fully firing, he didn't get broken and struck 42 winners -- double his unforced error count. It was especially impressive given Mayer's ability to throw off opponents with his change of pace and quirky forehand. Mayer, ranked as high as 18th and now the world No. 47, needed to claim the opening set to have a chance of upsetting the Scot. Once Murray took it in a tiebreak, and convincingly, Mayer's shoulders slumped and he proceeded to win four games the rest of the way. Murray was happy he didn't have to spend too long on court -- under two hours -- in the draining conditions. ""It cooled down a little bit towards the end but the first and second sets it was very hot,"" he said in an interview on court afterwards. ""It was very tough conditions and he's a very tricky opponent,"" Murray continued. ""He plays strange shots and he takes your time away. It's tough to get into a rhythm. ""I'm really glad to come through in three sets."" Murray's next foe is Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin, who topped steady Italian Andreas Seppi in five sets. Looking further ahead, Murray could meet the dangerous Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals and the Czech had an even easier time than Murray on Sunday. Berdych conceded a mere five games to Frenchman Julien Benneteau. The 31-year-old Williams, bidding to become the oldest U.S. Open women's winner in the Open era, captured eight of the last nine games to see off Stephens and book a spot in the quarterfinals. Stephens sent Williams packing in the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, although the latter was injured in the match, and some regard the 20-year-old as the future of American tennis. The pair were friends, fell out when Stephens criticized Williams but are now back on good terms. Williams next plays Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro, who upset Germany's Angelique Kerber in a third-set tiebreak.","Andy Murray beats Germany's Florian Mayer to reach the fourth round at the U.S. Open .

"Floods continued to devastate communities alongside the surging River Elbe in Germany's northeastern Saxony-Anhalt state Wednesday. Hundreds of people are being evacuated from their homes in the towns of Stendal and Aken, with the army using helicopters and amphibious vehicles to help move them to safety. ""One-hundred-and-fifty people refused to be evacuated, but were forced to leave their homes by authorities,"" a spokesman for Saxony-Anhalt's Interior Ministry in Magdeburg said. The evacuation process is still under way. In total, 45,000 people have been asked to leave their homes in Saxony-Anhalt, the state currently worst affected by the flooding. About 11,500 rescue workers are operating in the area. The village of Fischbeck, about six miles from Stendal, is completely flooded after a nearby dike was breached. Efforts to repair the dike have failed despite the deployment of two army helicopters to drop giant sand bags. Police who turned back a CNN team who tried to reach Fischbeck described the situation as critical and dangerous. Although the water level around Stendal is already falling, the water continues to flood villages downstream such as Klietz and Wust. Soldiers can't hold back the water . ""We expect the water to devastate further cities. Consequently we are trying to build new emergency dikes to stop the floods,"" said a spokesman for Saxony-Anhalt's interior ministry. Annette Friedebold, the owner of an animal park in Weissewarte, told CNN how she'd been forced to evacuate most of the 400 animals housed there, starting last Tuesday. ""We built small evacuation islands for the animals that had to stay. Fortunately, all of them survived the flooding. But it is going to take at least three months until everything will be rebuilt,"" she said. The flooding is the worst she has seen in more than 30 years working in Weissewarte. The village lies about 3.5 miles from the River Elbe, which is swollen from heavy rains at the start of the month. Record water levels along the Elbe as it makes its way to the North Sea have caused flooding in the Czech Republic, as well as eastern and northern Germany. Friedebold, who now has to travel through the park by boat to check on those animals who were left there, expects her park to be flooded for weeks to come. Like many other people in the affected regions, Friedebold hopes to receive donations. ""In 2002, when the last big flooding occurred, we thought we would have to file for bankruptcy. But we were lucky because a lot of people were there to help us,"" she said. ""A lot of our animals are still shocked and scared. But they have to be strong now."" Among the creatures still in the park are wild pigs and lynx. The latter sought refuge in the trees when the flood waters came. ""I still cannot believe what the water has done to me and my park,"" Friedebold said. The crest on the River Danube, which has also brought flooding to southern Germany, Austria and Slovakia, is expected to reach southern Hungary on Wednesday and the country's southwest a day later. Serbia is preparing for the Danube's waters to peak there in the next four days.","The army uses helicopter and amphibious vehicles to evacuate areas stranded by floods .

"(CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president tapped Al-Baji Qa'ed Al-Sebsi as the country's new prime minister Sunday, after the previous prime minister resigned amid protests, state-run media reported. Former Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi's resignation Sunday came a day after three people were killed during protests in the capital, Tunis. ""I am resigning today because I am not willing to be a person that takes decisions that could cause casualties,"" he told reporters Sunday. He also questioned ""why a lot of people considered their main target to keep attacking the government, although a lot of its members agreed to join in this critical time."" Three people were killed Saturday and nine others injured during mayhem in Tunis, according to an Interior Ministry statement cited by the state-run news agency, Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP). More than 100 people were arrested in the area around Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the city's center, and accused of ""acts of destruction and burning,"" the ministry said. Protesters had gathered in the area to demand that the interim government step down and the current parliament be disbanded. Demonstrators were also asking for suspension of the current constitution and the election of an assembly that can write a new one, as well as organize the transition to democracy. Protests in Tunisia erupted late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. By January 13, Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- turned executive power over to his prime minister and fled the country.","NEW: Interim president chooses new prime minister .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan secured their fourth straight victory in Italy's top flight Sunday with a 2-0 win over Catania to maintain their pursuit of unbeaten Serie A leaders Juventus. Boosted by their 1-0 defeat of AC Milan in the city derby last weekend, Inter were always on top in the San Siro after star man Antonio Cassano headed home in the 28th minute. Rodrigo Palacio added the clinching second with five minutes to go as Diego Milito set up his fellow Argentine to score his first goal for Inter. Inter coach Andrea Stramaccioni was delighted by their performance, particularly after the break. ""We're a team that's growing. The coach should only try to improve the team match by match,"" he told the official Inter website. ""Today was a step forward with a spectacular second half. Perhaps it was the first time we were fluid without giving anything away."" They stay in fourth place, four points adrift of Juventus, who maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 2-0 win over Napoli in a top of the table clash Saturday evening. Martin Caceres and 19-year-old Paul Pogba scored for Juve, who have opened up a three point lead over their opponents. Lazio's 3-2 win over struggling Milan has left them in third ahead of Inter on goal difference. The top four are well clear of fifth placed Fiorentina, who had to settle for a share of the points in the 1-1 draw at Chievo. French striker Cyril Thereau put the home side ahead in the first half but La Viola leveled only a minute later when Argentine defender Guillermo Rodriguez scored after a corner. In the English Premier League, fourth placed Everton had Steven Pienaar sent off in the second half at Loftus Road as they were held 1-1 by Queens Park Rangers. Midfielder Pienaar went for a second yellow card on the hour mark, but his side held on for a draw which leaves them a point ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. David Moyes' men went behind to a deflected Junior Hoilett strike before Sylvain Distin's header deflected in off QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar's back for an own goal to level. Sunday's other game in the EPL saw Sunderland and Newcastle draw 1-1 in the Tyne-Wear derby. Newcastle took the lead at the Stadium of Light through Yohan Cabaye's early strike, but had Cheick Tiote sent off for violent conduct in the 25th minute. The home side pressed hard for an equalizer and were rewarded when Demba Ba diverted a John O'Shea header past his own goalkeeper late on. In the German Bundesliga, Augsburg were held to a goalless draw at Nuremberg, while Hamburg went down to their first defeat since Rafael van der Vaart signed from Tottenham as they lost 1-0 to Stuttgart. Vedad Ibisevic scored the only goal on 30 minutes.","Inter Milan win fourth straight in Italy's Serie A .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- If you're a collection of animals trying to travel the many thousands of miles from the island of Madagascar to the island of Manhattan, it's fastest to fly -- but then you risk crashing on the continent of Africa, as happens in ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa.""

"Boston (CNN) -- Rebuffing his lawyers' request, a federal judge has set the trial date for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for November 3. The date was set during a status hearing in Boston federal court Wednesday. On Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers had filed a report requesting that the trial start no earlier than September 2015. Tsarnaev's lawyers said they had not had a chance to review the many pieces of physical evidence, ""including nearly 2,000 items that reportedly are still being analyzed by the FBI and items kept at additional locations."" They were unable to sway Judge George O'Toole. ""I think this is a realistic and fair date,"" he said Wednesday. Judy Clarke,Tsarnaev's lead attorney, said ""meeting the trial date will be impossible."" Prosecutors to seek death penalty . Prosecutors said they estimate the trial would last approximately 12 weeks. If Tsarnaev is found guilty, prosecutors expect the sentencing hearing would last approximately six weeks. Jurors will not only weigh whether he's guilty but also whether he deserves to die. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the April 15 attack, which left three people dead and more than 250 others injured. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother, Tamerlan, planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon, then killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later. The attacks triggered the massive manhunt that led to Tsarnaev's capture. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev during the manhunt.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- The Mumbai High Court rejected the appeal Monday of the only surviving gunman from the 2008 three-day terror attack on the Indian financial capital. A trial court handed down a death sentence last year for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, on charges of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. The city's High Court upheld his conviction and sentence, lawyer Ejaz Naqvi told reporters. The court, however, dismissed the prosecution's appeal against the acquittal of two Indian nationals that police had accused of conspiracy in connection with the November 2008 strikes on Mumbai, said Naqvi, who represented one of them. The high court upheld the acquittal Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed for a lack of ""corroborative"" evidence, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nika. He said authorities would petition the Supreme Court next. It was not immediately clear if Kasab too planned to file a fresh appeal to the country's highest court in New Delhi. Convicts on death-row in India reserve the right to challenge the sentencing in the nation's Supreme Court. They can also file a mercy petition with the country's president if the Supreme Court also turns down their plea. Kasab's lawyer, Farhana Shah, told reporters that her client would be briefed about options available to him. It will then be up to Kasab to make a decision about an appeal, she said. He would have 30 days to file his appeal, Shah said. During the raids, 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. More than 160 people died in the three-day coordinated attack. Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks. Indian forces killed nine suspects in the attack. Their bodies were embalmed and kept in a hospital morgue as some local Muslim groups refused them a burial in their graveyards, saying the attackers were not true followers of Islam. An Indian official in Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located, said a burial took place in January last year. He did not give the date or the exact location of what he described as a secret funeral. India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The group denied responsibility. The Mumbai attack derailed a fragile peace process between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan for about 15 months. This year, the two nuclear-capable nations announced resumption of their fully-fledged dialogue after a series of high-level meetings over the past one year.","Kasab was sentenced to death last year on murder and other charges .

"(CNN) -- The Arizona sheriff known nationwide for his tough stance on undocumented immigrants says he has a mission now that he's clinched another re-election victory: meeting with Latinos. ""I would hope to get together with the Latino community, if I could ever have them talk to me without screaming and threatening me,"" Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio told supporters as election results came in Tuesday night. ""So I hope to get together with the community and try to explain what we do, so that's going to be one of my missions coming up."" Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Justice Department have filed lawsuits accusing Arpaio of civil rights violations and racial discrimination against Latinos. Last December, the Justice Department said it had found cause to believe the sheriff's office ""has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the Constitution and federal law"" and, under the leadership of Arpaio, discriminated against Latinos through traffic stops, detentions and arrests and against Latino inmates with limited English proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services. Arpaio has denied any discrimination or civil rights violations, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a ""witch hunt."" Arpaio cleared of financial improprieties . On Tuesday night, the sheriff said he has no intention of changing his policies in his sixth term. ""I have a message for the president of the United States of America. He's gone after me from the White House, the Department of Justice, the FBI, I can go on and on. But I will continue to enforce all the laws, including illegal immigration,"" Arpaio told supporters. ""Nothing changes."" The 80-year-old sheriff, who has been in office for two decades, has fierce critics and staunch supporters. Latino voters mobilized in an attempt to defeat him at the polls this year. Meanwhile, Arpaio told supporters Tuesday night, financial support for his campaign poured in from across the country. Latinos a key part of new Democratic majority . Arpaio also gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents. Another controversial program: Arpaio's ""chain gangs,"" including the world's first-ever female and juvenile work gangs. Rather than shy away from controversy, he has embraced it, touting his nickname of ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation, costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece. He garnered 53% of votes cast in this year's election, and his chief opponent, Democrat Paul Penzone, conceded as results showed Arpaio ahead by 88,000 votes. ""Arpaio won, you have to accept it,"" said Alberto Gutier, a Republican analyst. ""He said it very clearly that he was going to be the sheriff that enforces laws, and not who makes laws."" Five things we learned on Election Night . But some Latino activists -- who had hoped Penzone would unseat Arpaio -- weren't ready to give in yet. ""The pledge to each person whose door we knocked on, the people that we registered in front of stores and apartment buildings, is that every one of their votes will be counted,"" said Petra Falcon, director of Promise Arizona, an immigrant advocacy organization. Falcon said many people voted on provisional ballots in the election, or cast absentee ballots that had yet to be counted by elections officials. Her group estimates that more than 400,000 votes may have yet to be counted. The Arizona Secretary of State Office said Wednesday that there were 344,000 uncounted early votes in Maricopa County and 115,000 provisional ballots yet to be verified there. Other activists said that problems for immigrants go far beyond Maricopa County. ""Many people are happy that (President Barack) Obama won again and others are upset that Arpaio won, but we know that they both work together to deport members of our community,"" said Carlos Garcia, director of the Puente human rights organization. While authorities count provisional ballots, other opponents of the controversial sheriff are hoping that a federal judge will rule in the civil rights cases against the Arizona sheriff and stop the sheriff from cracking down on undocumented immigrants. Profile: 'America's toughest sheriff' But Arpaio said Tuesday night that he had no intention of leaving public life any time soon. ""And by the way, for my critics out there, I'm going to say right now, in January I'm signing up for 2016. So I'm not a lame duck,"" he said. A crowd of supporters cheered. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Sheriff Joe Arpaio says he wants to talk with Latinos, but it's hard .

The agreement calls for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to Egypt's state news agency EGYNews. It was the November 14 assassination by Israeli forces of Ahmed al-Jaabari, the head of Hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting. It also calls for the Palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from Gaza against Israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border.

""They wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of Hamas. They claim they have done so, and they have not. They are bankrupt."" He cited Israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. ""This is their accomplishment,"" he said. ""They have nothing else to show. And our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute."" Besides a cease-fire, the agreement calls for the discussion of a number of issues, including freedom of movement in and out of Gaza and a commitment by Israel not to target Palestinian militants within Gaza. ...

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said the agreement calls for ""complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the Gaza Strip."" ""For us, that's victory. That's what we wanted,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Israel will hold Hamas responsible for any attacks from Gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, Regev said. He said the agreement reflects that understanding. Regev also said the deal calls for immediate talks on economic restrictions on Gaza. ""If the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming,"" he said.

CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour, in an interview in Cairo, asked Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal whether Hamas was responsible for Wednesday's bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv, Israel. ""Not Hamas, not others, not other people from, not Hamas. No one can announce except those who committed (it), not me,"" Meshaal said. ""The lesson is what matters. What led to this? Who created the circumstances that led to this (operation)? It is (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu with his crimes, in killing the kids of Gaza, and the continuity of aggression. He (creates) such ramifications everywhere. This could lead to any kind of reaction as retaliation for what happened in Gaza."" ... (9:25 a.m. ET, 4:25 p.m. local) Israeli President Shimon Peres on chances for a cease-fire . CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Peres if there would be a cease-fire. ""I hope so,"" Peres replied. ""It is not yet done. There are difficulties, in any negotiation there are difficulties, but this time their expectations are over the horizon. But we are waiting and trying. The situation is very strange; both sides won't like a ground operation, neither us or them. A cease-fire is preferred by both sides, but the conditions they start to put (out) are little bit exaggerated."" When asked what Hamas wanted of Israel, he added: ""They want Israel to do nothing. We shall not fly over, we shall not guard the border. Many others. The conditions of Israel (are) basically security conditions.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate was called to order for 11 seconds on Wednesday as the last political scuffle of the year between the White House and the Democratic-led Congress played out. Democratic senators will hold short ""pro forma"" sessions over the holiday break to prevent recess appointments. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday last week, but Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments -- a constitutional mechanism that allows the president, during congressional recesses, to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, opened and then immediately gaveled the Senate session to a close. He spent 57 seconds in the chamber. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of ""pro forma"" sessions through mid-January. Talks had just broken down with the White House on a deal that would have allowed the president to make dozens of those appointments if he agreed not to appoint one controversial official, Steven Bradbury, as the permanent head of the influential Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. Bush declined to accept the Democrats' offer, and Reid refused to approve Bradbury because of concerns about his involvement in crafting legal opinions for the administration on interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects. Similar sessions were conducted over the Thanksgiving recess. Webb also did the duty Friday, but he won't be the only senator tasked with presiding over the shortened sessions. Other Democrats -- including Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Chuck Schumer of New York -- will share the duty.

"(CNN) -- Let's see how far this goes without making a dead parrot reference. Wish me luck. Monty Python's Flying Circus cannot be stopped. And, apparently, not even contained. The five surviving members of the British-based renegade comedy troupe announced this week they were getting the band back together for live performances, their first together in more than a decade. In the funny business world, this is equivalent to the Beatles getting back together. And the Rolling Stones, too. (Oh, wait. They've never broken up exactly, have they? Rewind.) See what I just did? I broke the pattern, digressed from form -- and did so with unapologetic silliness. If you want to know why this Python get-together has aroused such good feeling from everyone, you have to begin by knowing that this is how Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin went about their business back when their BBC series began in 1969. The Pythons stretched, tugged and bent the TV variety-revue format into shapes unimagined in the medium except by such American pioneers of surreal TV as Ernie Kovacs. Imagine, for instance, having three clueless and crass Spanish Inquisitors burst into an English drawing room for a routine and using them as a running gag through other routines on the same episode up to and including the closing credits. Monty Python did that bit and many more, using unlikely elements, like bicycle repairmen, hapless superheroes, dotty old ladies, bookshops with naughty dentists, cheese shops with dancing men in derby hats and lots and lots of Spam. ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" made landfall -- or, rather, pratfall -- on American public television stations in the early 1970s, and its unapologetic anarchy and snide surrealism triumphed here. Oh, there were some who didn't get the jokes, believing the blithe zaniness of the Pythons' humor to be irrelevant to the Vietnam War and on behalf of women's rights, black empowerment, gay pride and other white-hot issues of that polarized time. What these solemn spoilsports didn't, or couldn't understand at the time is that sociopolitical conflicts come and go, but a dirty fork and a sissy lumberjack are things of lasting consequence and sublimity. Those who weren't there at the time -- and you know who you are -- can see for yourselves what all the giggling was about thanks in large part to YouTube's Monty Python Channel, which the troupe initiated in 2008 as a site for showcasing its vintage BBC sketches as well as scenes from such classic Python films as 1975's ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" 1979's ""Life of Brian"" and 1983's ""The Meaning of Life."" With Python-esque faux grouchiness, the channel urged its viewers to ""click on the links, buy our movies and TV shows, and soften our pain from being ripped off all these years."" They're kidding, of course. At least, they seem to be. But I'm speculating that one of the reasons the band is getting back together (without Chapman, who died in 1989) is partly to take advantage of this fresh wave of digital fans who've never seen them act silly in public, but have likely wasted time at work or home watching the ""Flying Lesson"" routine in which Jones walks into an office seeking a pilot's license and is instead goaded by Chapman, suspended in midair, to flap his arms and jump off a desk? Or to watch Palin walk into a formal office in search of an argument and find himself in a pointless series of contradictions with a stuffy Cleese? Or to watch those same two gentleman in riotous dispute over the sentience of a Norwegian blue parrot . ... (Almost made it! Dang!) The only question this week's news offers is whether these now-septuagenarian crazy men are still limber enough to bring fresh surprises to the table. I'm going to go with ... probably. Which is the best I can do until I see for myself whether Jones and Palin can still work their old-lady outfits.

"(CNN) -- She was only crowned Miss Universe Thailand on Saturday but Weluree ""Fai"" Ditsayabut has already become caught up in the political crisis engulfing her country, after comments were found on her Facebook page referring to pro-government demonstrators as ""dirty,"" ""evil activists"" that should ""all be executed."" According to news site Khaosod English, the 22-year-old has often published scathing comments about the ""red shirt"" movement on her Facebook page, which now appears to have been deleted. ""I am not neutral. I am on the side of His Majesty the King,"" Weluree said in a comment from November, Khaosod English reported. ""I'm so angry at these evil activists. They should all be executed."" Weluree reportedly said Thailand would be cleaner if the ""dirty"" red shirts left the country. Pro-government supporters have questioned Weluree's pageant victory on popular online forums and social media sites. A Facebook page in protest of her winning the competition had over 10,000 ""likes"" on Monday -- although some users criticized her appearance and claimed she won because of her connections, rather than raising concerns about her anti-red shirt comments. The deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, Phil Robertson, condemned Weluree's remarks on Twitter. ""Perhaps (a) better title is Miss Politically Divided #Thailand? Shameful when beauty queens are calling for executions,"" he wrote. Weluree -- an actress, talk show host, and English student -- apologized Monday for the remarks in an interview on Thailand's Channel 3. ""I was careless. I was young. I did it recklessly,"" she said. ""It won't happen again."" Weluree beat the pageant favorite Pimbongkod ""Ellie"" Chankaew who placed second in Saturday's competition. The pageant organizers have not responded to the controversy, nor have the leaders of the pro-government movement. Thailand's political turmoil began in November when the government attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill that would have cleared the way for the return of then-prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra's brother, Thaksin, to politics. The former prime minister and tycoon has been living in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction after being overthrown in a military coup in 2006. Since November, the People's Democratic Reform Committee has led anti-government protesters, who are mostly middle-class royalists, in calling for Yingluck's government to be replaced with an unelected ""people's council."" Competing rallies have been held by pro-government supporters, many of whom come from the country's rural north and northeast and view Shinawatra's ouster as a ""judicial coup."" Yingluck was found guilty of abuse of power and removed from office along with several cabinet ministers on May 7, and indicted by Thailand's anti-graft body. If the Senate votes to impeach her, she could be banned from politics for five years. Monday marks a particularly sensitive day for the red shirt movement as the anniversary of a military crackdown that left more than 90 people dead and thousands injured in 2010.

"A group of men who devoted their lives to hunting powerful storms died in the middle of the chase. Tim Samaras, his son Paul Samaras and Carl Young were killed Friday while following a tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma, relatives told CNN on Sunday. Their work tracking tornadoes was featured on the former Discovery Channel show ""Storm Chasers."" They were among 13 people killed in storms that struck Oklahoma on Friday night, according to Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant. At the intersection where authorities said the three storm chasers were killed, crews hauled away a mangled white truck Sunday that had been crushed like a tin can. The metal frame of their storm-chasing vehicle was twisted almost beyond recognition. The windows had been smashed to bits. Canadian County Undersheriff Chris West confirmed that three storm chasers had been killed but declined to provide additional details about the circumstances of their deaths. ""We also want to say that storm chasers and meteorologists and news stations, that's part of the vital link in getting the word out to people so that they don't become victims,"" he said. ""A lot of these individuals have dedicated many years of their lives to going out and assisting and tracking storms, and getting footage and putting themselves in harm's way so they can educate the public to the destructive power of these storms."" Friday's tornado took a sudden turn that surprised many observers, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""It was a wobbler. And it was big. ... I think the left-hand turn made a big difference on how this thing was chased as well and why people were killed and why people were injured in their vehicles,"" he said. ""A vehicle is not a place to be in any tornado, especially a big one like that, and those men doing their job, those field scientists out there doing their jobs, were killed in the process."" Tim Samaras founded TWISTEX, the Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in Tornadoes Experiment, to help learn more about tornadoes and increase lead time for warnings, according to the official website. In 2004, he told CNN that being near storms was part of the job. ""In order to get directly in the path, you have to be close,"" he said. ""Actually I'm pretty focused on our safety, certainly, and I'm focused on getting the data and getting the right spot,"" he said. ""You only have one chance to do it."" A dangerous job . ""They all unfortunately passed away but doing what they loved,"" Jim Samaras wrote in a statement posted on his brother's Facebook page. Myers, who also covered Friday's storm in Oklahoma, said Tim Samaras was known for his attention to safety. ""There's just no one safer than Tim. Tim, he would never put himself in danger,"" Myers said. ""He certainly wouldn't put his son in danger."" One of Samaras' goals, Myers said, was collecting more data to help government officials. ""We all know that this is difficult and dangerous and sometimes things go wrong. But I think to portray Tim as just a chaser out for a thrill is just the wrong thing,"" Myers said. ""I just want people to know that Tim was a scientist. He was out there to put probes out there. He was out there to learn and understand and to make science more understandable. ... We all go out there and we try to protect the public, but Tim was even one step higher."" Samaras had received 18 grants from the National Geographic Society for his research, said Terry Garcia, the organization's executive vice president of missions. In a written statement, he described Samaras' studies of lightning as ""pioneering."" ""Tim was a courageous and brilliant scientist who fearlessly pursued tornadoes and lightning in the field in an effort to better understand these phenomena,"" he said. ""Though we sometimes take it for granted, Tim's death is a stark reminder of the risks encountered regularly by the men and women who work for us,"" Garcia said. ""This is an enormous loss for his family, his wide circle of friends and colleagues and National Geographic."" Doug Kiesling, a videographer who chases storms and calls himself ""The Weather Paparazzi,"" said the three men were more than storm chasers. ""They're researchers,"" he said. ""This thing is really shaking up everyone in the chasing community,"" he said. ""We knew this day would happen someday, but nobody would imagine that it would happen to Tim. Tim was one of the safest people to go out there. ... He's had close calls, but he's always had an escape route."" El Reno Mayor Matt White didn't provide details about those killed after the tornado struck, but he stressed the importance of staying indoors when powerful storms hit. ""We had to deal with not only strong winds, but we had extreme hail, extreme softball-size hail. El Reno had a lot of damage to the roads,"" he told reporters on Sunday. ""In these situations, we can't stress enough to people to stay inside and do what the weather men and women tell us to do."" Close call: One storm chaser's story . Friday's storm was particularly unpredictable, according to Mike Bettes, an anchor and meteorologist for The Weather Channel who had a close call himself. The tornado swept up the tornado-hunt truck he and a crew were traveling in, tossed it 200 yards into a field and smashed it to the ground. ""I think this was just an erratic tornado. I think the size of it and the speed of it changed very, very quickly,"" he told CNN on Sunday morning. ""I think the direction of movement changed quickly. And I think there were a lot of people out there that, you know, ended up getting stuck in positions we didn't want to be in."" Bettes described the experience as the scariest moment of his life. ""I saw people in my life, I saw their faces flash right in front of me. And it just seemed for a moment, everything was in slow motion,  especially when we were floating,"" he said. ""I kind of felt like I was being lifted to heaven or something. I was conscious through the whole thing and remember the whole thing, but it's still a surreal moment."" Bettes and several others emerged with scratches and bruises. One crew member had broken bones, he said, but was in good spirits. The experience left him rattled and unsure whether he'll go out to chase storms again. But Bettes said he had no doubt about the value of storm chasing. ""We show weather, and we like to be out there and show people what these things can do, and help give advance warning. A lot of times the storm spotters out there serve a very valuable purpose. They give ground truth to what meteorologists from the National Weather Service are doing,"" he said. ""But seeing it in person, seeing it for real, and giving that real time information, I think really supplements the warning. It helps people take shelter ahead of time."" ""Storm Chasers"" aired for five years on the Discovery Channel. The last season ended in the fall of 2011. The network expressed condolences in a statement Sunday. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of Carl Young, Tim Samaras and his son. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families,"" the statement said. Photos from a professional storm chaser . Tornadoes rip through heartland again: How to help . Powerful storms leave trail of damage, death . The latest round of storms to hit the heartland left a fresh trail of damage and destruction in its wake as tornadoes struck and floodwaters surged. Tornadoes tore through the Oklahoma City and St. Louis areas Friday, ripping up homes and sending thousands scrambling for cover. On Saturday morning, a spokeswoman for the state's chief medical examiner's office said two children and seven adults were killed in the Oklahoma storms. On Sunday, Oklahoma City Fire Chief Keith Bryant said searchers had found the bodies of four additional victims that died in the storm -- two adults and two children who died while seeking shelter in a storm drain. Deputy Fire Chief Marc Woodard said the body of another child had been recovered Sunday afternoon, and the search for six other people unaccounted for will continue Monday. The flash flooding that accompanied Friday night's storm swept the bodies up to four to five miles downstream, Woodard said. The impact of the severe weather extended beyond Oklahoma. In Missouri, a tornado left a path of ""over 10 miles of significant damage ... that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up,"" Gov. Jay Nixon told CNN affiliate KSDK on Saturday. No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in the state, Nixon said. In Arkansas, flooding claimed the lives of at least four people -- a sheriff, a wildlife officer and two women they were trying to save from a home deluged by floodwaters, officials said. The house collapsed in the middle of the rescue attempt, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens said.","Oklahoma City fire chief says 16 people were killed statewide .

"(CNN)Has Russian President Vladimir Putin gone completely mad? This question is actually being debated in serious circles. In a telephone conversation with President Obama a few months ago, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have suggested her Russian counterpart is ""living in another world."" The Ukraine crisis: Everything you need to know . Just last week, a leaked report commissioned by the U.S. Defense Department in 2008 concluded that the Russian leader may have Asperger's Syndrome, a type of high-functioning autism. The report said it may account for his apparently high degree of control. A Pentagon spokesman said there was no guidance from the Department of Defense on the report and experts told CNN they were skeptical of the reliability of the Asperger's claim. For the record, the Kremlin has dismissed the allegation as utter nonsense. Putin, though, is an enigma. His unflinching support for rebel separatists in Eastern Ukraine, despite their alleged excesses, has plunged Russia's relations with the West into their worst crisis since the end of the Cold War. Even in the face of mounting international sanctions that have isolated Russia and helped hobble its fragile economy, Western officials say weapons and manpower continue to flow across the border, although the Kremlin insists it is supplying neither. Clearly, Putin is determined to get his way in Ukraine. We already know, essentially, what this means in terms of a peace deal -- a truce was signed last September, although it didn't hold. The Minsk Protocol agreed that, among other things, autonomy would be granted to Ukraine's southeastern regions. The Russian language would be given official status. A buffer zone would be established along the front lines and heavy weapons would be pulled back from civilian areas. But Putin may actually want much more. On an official visit to Egypt this week, the Russian president dropped a large hint -- and not for the first time. In an interview with the Al-Ahram newspaper he rejected Russian responsibility for the crisis in Ukraine. ""It emerged in response to the attempts of the U.S.A. and its Western allies, who considered themselves winners of the Cold War, to impose their will everywhere,"" Putin told the newspaper. ""Promises of non-expansion of the NATO to the east have turned out to be hollow statements,"" he said. A solution to the Ukraine crisis, then, may involve ruling the country out of any future NATO membership, however unpalatable that may be to some in the West. Russian diplomats call it guaranteeing Ukraine's ""neutral status"" -- which sounds much better than ""capitulation."" The bigger problem, though, is that this may not end with Ukraine. For Putin, this crisis is only the latest in a catalog of grievances, which includes the West trampling over Russia's interests from Kosovo to Iraq, to Libya and Syria. Putin's ultimate goal may be to tear up the post-Soviet assumptions about what Russia will tolerate, and permanently change Russia's relationship with the West. Obama says Putin has failed to modernize Russia .","A solution to the Ukraine crisis may involve ruling the country out of any future NATO membership, writes Matthew Chance .

"(CNN)  -- In a previous posting about voting issues, I mentioned J. Alex Halderman, an assistant professor of engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, whose ""resume"" includes hacking into voting machines in the name of exposing security flaws. Analysis: Our votes are counted accurately -- aren't they? At the time, his best-known exploit involved accessing a supposedly tamper-proof voting machine and getting it to play Pac-Man. It turns out that as I was writing that, Halderman and his students pulled off another coup, exposing vulnerabilities in an internet-based system for overseas and military voters that the District of Columbia planned to test in the November election. ""Within 36 hours of the system going live, our team had found and exploited a vulnerability that gave us almost total control of the server software, including the ability to change votes and reveal voters' secret ballots,"" Halderman wrote on his blog. This link is Halderman's how-we-did-it. Along the way, Halderman's team ""collected crucial secret data stored on the server,"" ""modified all the ballots that had already been cast to contain write-in votes for candidates we selected,"" ""installed a back door that let us view any ballots that voters cast after our attack,"" and -- best of all -- ""left a 'calling card' on the system's confirmation screen, which voters see after voting."" Official ballot: District of Columbia mock election (pdf) After 15 seconds, the page plays the University of Michigan fight song. Here's a demonstration. The ""Wolverines"" attack on D.C.'s experiment went undetected, Halderman said, until the fight song (""Hail to the Victors"") was discovered. To be fair, the people running the D.C. pilot program made a couple of weeks available for outsiders to have a crack at their system. While Halderman and his students did their best in the name of protecting the sanctity of the voting process, it appears that there were others with potentially less-friendly motives also taking advantage of the test period. Testifying before the D.C. Board of Ethics and Elections -- in a virtually empty room, according to news reports -- Halderman dropped this bomb: ""While we were in control of these systems we observed other attack attempts originating from computers in Iran and China. These attackers were attempting to guess the same master password that we did. And since it was only four letters long, they would likely have soon succeeded."" Halderman's team even changed the D.C. system's password (who uses a four-letter password?) to thwart the foreign intrusions. Granted, this was a test and only a test of a small pilot program. But the idea of attempts from outside of the United States to compromise the security of the most basic of American rights should worry anyone who cares about the political process. Flaws in the D.C. system wasn't the only issue making news: . • The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law spotlights three potential threats: voter registration problems (3 million people were unable to vote in 2008 because of such issues and registration efforts are notably fewer than the last election), ballot ""security"" operations (often allegations of voter suppression or intimidation) and voting machines. Another read on voter suppression concerns. • The controversy over the Justice Department's handling of the ""Black Panther"" voter intimidation case in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Election Day 2008 has not faded; if anything, it's grown as an issue for political conservatives. • The Sentencing Project reports that between 1997 and 2010 an estimated 800,000 people convicted of felonies regained their right to vote, as 23 states have, in varying fashions, changed their laws on the subject. • Concerns remain about U.S. military personnel stationed overseas getting ballots from their home states in time to vote and mail back before Election Day. Several states received waivers from a new requirement that ballots be mailed out by 45 days before the election, to ensure their return on time. • If you're interested in following current court cases involving voting issues, check out this website from the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University.","Professor, students expose vulnerabilities in internet-based voting system .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal ended the Paris Masters run of defending champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Friday to help fellow-Spaniard Fernando Verdasco book his spot at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. Tsonga needed to retain his title to deny Verdasco a place at the prestigious eight-man tournament later this month, but found Nadal far too consistent and fell to a 7-5 7-5 quarterfinal defeat. The world number two struggled in his first two matches, saving five match points against Nicolas Almagro before edging out Tommy Robredo, but his form was much improved on Friday. Tsonga dominated much of the first set with his blistering groundstrokes but could not take advantage of five break points and gradually Nadal took the sting out of his opponent before breaking in the 11th game. The second set took on a similar pattern, although the errors were more frequent from the home favorite and Nadal again broke at 5-5 thanks to a poor game from Tsonga. The 23-year-old confidently served out for victory and will now face third seed Novak Djokovic in a superb semifinal showdown on Saturday. Djokovic was a 6-4 1-6 6-3 winner against Robin Soderling, who would needed to reach the final in Bercy to have a chance of reaching the London finals. The Swede dominated the second set and created 14 break points on his opponent's serve during the match, but took only three of them. Serb Djokovic admitted he was not at his best and was relieved to reach the last four after a fifth successive victory over Soderling. He told Sky Sports: ""I'm very pleased to go through, it was a big struggle for me. Mostly I was fighting myself. In the second set I was not moving well and I was letting him control the match but in the end I managed to hold the nerves and focus."" Nadal and Djokovic have met 19 times, with the Spaniard holding a clear lead at 14-5. However, Djokovic won their last encounter in Cincinnati in August for the loss of only five games.","Rafael Nadal beats holder Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to reach Paris Masters semifinals .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners and supporters crowded hillsides near Srebrenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sunday, to mark the 15th anniversary of the massacre of nearly 8,000 men and boys. More than 50,000 people witnessed the burial of 775 newly identified genocide victims at the Centre Potocari -- the official Srebrenica Genocide Memorial where 5,000 genocide victims are buried -- a few miles outside the city, according to Bosnia-Herzegovina's official news agency, Fena. In 1995, Potocari served as a safe-haven for Bosnian Muslims. They were under the protection of a U.N.-Dutch-led mission. The massacre of men and boys occurred when ethnic Serb troops overran the United Nations safe area. The five-day slaughter was the worst European massacre since World War II and was described by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal as ""the triumph of evil."" Witnesses, human rights investigators and court testimonies documented the summary executions, as well the rape and murder of women. Sunday's burial was attended by top international officials, including a U.S. delegation whose members read a statement from President Barack Obama. In the statement, Obama called the Srebrenica massacre an ""unimaginable"" tragedy that has left an indelible ""stain on our collective conscience."" ""Fifteen years ago today, despite decades of pledges of 'never again,' 8,000 men and boys were murdered in these fields and hills,"" said in the statement. ""They were brothers, sons, husbands, and fathers, and they all became victims of genocide."" Obama also called on all governments to ""redouble their efforts"" to find and prosecute those responsible for the tragedy. ""This includes Ratko Mladic, who presided over the killings and remains at large,"" he said, referring to the former Bosnian Serb army commander. Mladic has been charged with genocide and remains a fugitive. Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic is now on trial at the tribunal in The Hague. Fena news agency reported that Boris Tadic, president of Serbia, also attended the burial memorial of the genocide victims and promised to find Serb war criminals. ""I, as the president of Serbia, will never give up finding them, and especially Ratko Mladic. When that ends, I will consider a part of my job completed,"" Tadic said. ""But before that, it is important that people reach out to one another and to continue living as people. A lot of time has passed, and I have done everything possible for Mladic to be arrested,"" he said.","Obama: Massacre leaves ""stain on our collective conscience""

"(CNN) -- Edgar Hernandez didn't expect to learn that he was pre-diabetic at age 16. When his mother burst into tears at the doctor's office, it hit him hard. He was 370 pounds and couldn't stand to look at himself. It was tough being a fat kid, but things became unbearable in high school. Edgar was seeing a therapist for depression symptoms. He was frequently bullied in gym class. Kids would point at his ""fat wobbling everywhere,"" especially as he struggled to keep up. ""I tried my best to ignore it. But there were times when I just gave in and started crying,"" said Edgar, who lives in a suburb of St. Louis and is now 18. Everyone in his family had a weight problem; his parents developed type 2 diabetes in their forties. But Edgar was the biggest. ""He would eat two really big burritos or sandwiches a day, packed with cheese, sour cream, a lot of bread, butter,"" his older brother Mario said. ""He would be watching TV, playing video games."" After receiving the sobering blood test result at the doctor's office, Edgar went home and cried. And then something new happened: He owned up to his weight problem. ""It was time to stop blaming others for my choices and make a choice to take responsibility,"" he said. He dried his tears, threw on his jacket and began jogging. He only got about half a mile before he stopped and threw up. That was a year and a half ago. Edgar, who is 5-foot-9, went on to drop nearly 200 pounds. He now weighs 185 pounds. He has traded his double-XL shirts and size 48 pants for medium T-shirts and 33-inch pants. It happened slowly at first. After that gut-impulse jog in November 2012, Edgar started walking before or after school. As he could, he added distance until he was walking about two miles a day. He started to incorporate running intervals until, months later, he could run a full mile. The weight began to come off, but the teen wasn't seeing as much progress as he had hoped. It was his older brother, Mario, who helped him kick the weight loss into high gear. Mario, who carried 235 pounds on his 5-foot-7 frame, was inspired by Edgar's will to change. He took Edgar to the grocery store and together they overhauled the family's pantry. Chicken breasts and fresh produce replaced the processed foods and sodas that were once the staple at home, Mario said. Edgar's typical breakfast became a peanut butter sandwich with honey and banana slices. Dinners usually featured a chicken breast with two cups of broccoli. He didn't have a specific diet or calorie count; it was all about portion sizes, the teen said. The brothers became each other's support. They started running together in January 2013, buying sweatpants and thermal gear to keep them warm in the Illinois weather. Mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, Edgar said. The brothers, who live at home with their parents, have seen their weight loss inspire some changes for the whole family, Mario said. The family has cut down on eating out -- once every couple of weeks, as opposed to four to five times a week. ""As a family, we go outside more, walk a little more. It shows because we have a lot more energy,"" Mario said. ""Even though other members haven't lost as much weight, maybe five pounds, you can see it in their faces."" These days, Edgar can't get enough of running. His favorite activities are heavy cardio and weightlifting. The teen even ran his first half-marathon in April, and he's planning another one soon. ""Running is what made me feel happy; I had gotten what they call 'runner's high' and now running has become a lifestyle,"" he said. Edgar has also found his calling in his new healthy lifestyle. He will start college at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville in the fall and plans to study exercise science. For Mario, watching his little brother shed the pounds at such a young age has been a source of pride. ""If you would have told me three years ago that he'd be running a half-marathon, I wouldn't believe you,"" Mario said. ""You see a completely different person that's a lot happier, has more energy and is more active."" Edgar couldn't agree more. ""I wouldn't even step out my door to get the mail before,"" he said. ""People don't see the dark, sad side of me anymore. They see a bright, happy kid."" For the people out there looking to lose weight, the teenager has the following advice: Don't put it off. If you say you're going to run, do it today, not tomorrow. ""Don't wait, because it will get worse,"" he said. ""You'll start putting it off until something serious happens and when something serious happens, it will change your life.""

"(CNN) -- Our experience in Iraq provides three essential lessons that should guide America's response to the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people. First, the president must present the American people and the international community with clear evidence that the al-Assad regime was responsible for the use of chemical weapons. The Bush administration took America to war in Iraq based on the false claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, including stockpiles of chemical weapons. Those false claims not only led us into a costly and unnecessary war, but did lasting damage to America's credibility. That erosion of credibility is haunting us now, as many in the international community question our claim that the al-Assad regime used chemical weapons. That makes it imperative that the Obama administration present clear and convincing evidence that the al-Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons use. Second, if the Obama administration presents such evidence, it is essential that the United States and the international community take strong action to punish the regime and deter the future use of chemical weapons in Syria or elsewhere in the world. Again, the Iraq example is instructive. Many would like to forget the fact that the United States and the international community willfully ignored Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war and against Iraq's Kurdish population in 1988 in the aftermath of that war. I remember those days well. Together with Peter Galbraith, my former colleague on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I traveled to the Iraq-Turkey border in September 1988 to investigate Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons offensive against the Kurds. We returned to Washington to urge the United States government to impose economic sanctions against Iraq for its use of chemical weapons. While the United States Senate did pass such legislation, it was opposed by the Reagan administration and never made it out of the House of Representatives. Recently released CIA documents demonstrate that the Reagan administration deliberately ignored Iraq's use of chemical weapons because it favored Iraq in its war against Iran. But the failure of that sanctions legislation represented a failure of the United States to help enforce the international convention against the use of chemical weapons. A strong case can be made that the refusal of the United States and the international community to confront Saddam Hussein for his flagrant violations of the international ban on chemical weapons emboldened him to take additional reckless actions. In 1990, he miscalculated the international response to his invasion of Kuwait. Years later, even after he had destroyed his chemical weapons stockpile, he underestimated the depth of international concern that he was still hiding them. That is perhaps not surprising, considering that the international community did nothing when Saddam Hussein actually used chemical weapons in the 1980s. The United States and the international community must not again stand idly by if the al-Assad regime, or another party, has used chemical weapons. It must take action to uphold international norms and send a clear signal that breaches of the international ban on chemical weapons use will not be tolerated. Failure to act upon strong evidence will only encourage Bashar al-Assad and other international actors to use chemical weapons in the future. The third lesson from Iraq is equally important as the first two. Our mission must be clearly defined and achievable at an acceptable cost. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush established a well defined goal -- using force to oust Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. He deliberately chose not to send American troops to Baghdad to topple Saddam Hussein, because he rightfully determined that the United States would not be able to contain the violent fallout without a huge commitment of American lives and treasure. President George W. Bush later made the mistake that his father avoided. The Iraq war clearly established that even massive U.S. troop intervention on the ground for over eight years cannot change many of the basic cultural and sectarian forces at play in the region. Today, despite the huge sacrifice in American and Iraqi lives, Iraq is rocked by almost daily eruptions of sectarian violence. The American-backed, Shiite-dominated government of Iraq now allows Iranian planes to use its airspace to supply weapons to al-Assad and the minority Shiite Alawite sect that controls Syria. Meanwhile, al Qaeda and Sunni extremists in Iraq are fighting to defeat the government in Baghdad as al Qaeda and Sunni extremist forces in Syria are fighting in tandem with American-supported rebels to defeat the al-Assad regime. The toxic mix of forces suggests that even a large U.S. troop presence in Syria would be unlikely to change these deep-running currents. These lessons are important as President Obama defines the purpose of American military action in Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons. The president should make clear that the goal of our military action is to punish Syria for its blatantly illegal use of chemical weapons and to deter the future use of such weapons by the Syrian regime or others that might contemplate their use in future conflicts. Our action should be coupled with a clear statement that any future use of chemical weapons will be met with increasing force. This goal can be reasonably accomplished by using cruise missile strikes that inflict significant pain and damage on al-Assad's forces without putting American lives in the line of fire. Some have argued that it is pointless for the United States to engage in punitive military strikes against Syria unless our actions are designed to decisively tip the military balance toward the rebels. That claim downplays the more limited, but nevertheless important, objective of deterring the future use of chemical weapons. Moreover, defining the success of our response as decisively changing the military balance is unrealistic, unachievable without putting American lives at risk, and will ultimately drag the United States toward full-scale intervention in a Syrian civil war. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated that measures like the establishment of a no-fly zone would put American pilots at risk and may not change the situation on the ground. Measuring success of these actions in terms of changing the tide of the war will lead inexorably to further assertions that American credibility is at stake and suck America into a costly civil war that could, with the current configuration of forces, result in the extremist al Qaeda elements among the rebels gaining the upper hand. That is why it is so important to define this particular mission in a way that can be achieved at an acceptable cost. Let's heed three important lessons from Iraq: Protect our credibility by presenting clear evidence of the use of chemical weapons by the al-Assad regime; take strong action to punish the illegal use of chemical weapons and deter their future use; and define the mission in achievable terms at a cost we are willing to pay. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Van Hollen.","Rep. Chris van Hollen: Three lessons from Iraq can guide intervention in Syria .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- New York Gov. David Paterson met with Senate hopeful Caroline Kennedy Saturday afternoon, but the governor's spokesman said details of the meeting will be kept private. Caroline Kennedy hopes to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior senator. Erin Duggan, Paterson's spokesman, said the two met at the governor's Manhattan office about 2 p.m. ET. She would not disclose what the pair talked about, nor say how long the meeting lasted. Kennedy is one of the candidates hoping to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior senator if the Senate confirms Clinton as secretary of state. Paterson, who has the sole responsibility to replace Clinton, has been the target of intense lobbying efforts by would-be senators in recent weeks. Clinton has said she is staying out of the process of picking her successor and letting Paterson decide. Whoever the governor picks would serve for two years before running in a special election in 2010. If the candidate won that contest, that person would have to run again in 2012, when Clinton's current term ends. Paterson is a Democrat, so the seat is likely to remain in the party's hands. Kennedy, daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy and niece of longtime Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, has received the most media attention. However, critics are questioning whether she's ready to follow the political path taken by family members.  Watch Kennedy discuss political aspirations » . Kennedy, 51, has been involved in education reform and women's issues, but she has never held public office and has mostly stayed out of the public spotlight.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The prosecutor sounded like the narrator of a hard-boiled police drama as he carefully laid out pieces of the puzzle that led detectives to arrest one of their own in a 23-year-old cold case. ""A bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart, that's the evidence that will prove to you that defendant Stephanie Lazarus murdered Sherri Rasmussen,"" Deputy District Attorney Shannon Presby told jurors as an unusual criminal trial began this week in Los Angeles Superior Court. The trial promises to tell the story of a decorated female officer who rose through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department while allegedly hiding a dark secret: She was getting away with murder. Lazarus, now 51 and retired from the force, is accused of killing her college crush's new bride in 1986, staging the crime scene to make it look like a burglary. Yes, she was a police officer, but she did not kill in the line of duty, or to protect the public, Presby alleged. ""This killing was personal."" Rasmussen was a tall, athletic 29-year-old hospital nursing supervisor with a pretty smile. She met a brutal end, beaten, bitten and shot to death in her townhouse in the suburban San Fernando Valley on February 24, 1986. She'd also been tied up and hit over the head with a vase. To police, it looked like a burglary gone bad. Stereo components were stacked by the door and Rasmussen's new BMW, an engagement gift, was missing. The case intrigues because it blends soap opera suds with ""CSI""-style forensics -- including broken fingernails and a bite mark. It also promises to hold up a mirror to one of the nation's most storied law enforcement agencies. ""Metaphorically speaking, this case is about the new LAPD investigating the old LAPD,"" said Andrew Blankstein, who has covered the department for the Los Angeles Times since the 1990s. ""This trial really traces the evolution of the LAPD and its approach to investigations, coupled with the revolutionary advances in technology."" He added, ""There's the old adage that the LAPD would never go after one of its own, but this case flies in the face of that."" According to prosecutor Presby, the crime was all about a guy. Witnesses who knew them in college at UCLA will testify that Lazarus was smitten with John Ruetten, but he just wasn't that into her. To underscore his portrayal of Lazarus as a woman obsessed, Presby displayed an old photograph found during a 2009 police search of the journals she'd stashed in a footlocker at home. Taken at their college dorm 30 years earlier, it shows Ruetten sleeping with his back to the camera. He was wearing only white cotton briefs. Ruetten did care for Lazarus, Presby continued, but in his view they were just good friends -- with occasional ""benefits."" Defense attorney Mark Overland told jurors there was much more to the relationship. The couple dated after college, went on trips and slept together ""many, many times."" Lazarus thought it was serious and also got to know and love Ruetten's mother and brother. She thought they had a future, the lawyer said. When she learned Ruetten was marrying someone else, Lazarus decided to lay her cards on the table. She told him how she felt. They slept together one last time, and then he told her he was going ahead with his marriage to Rasmussen, Overland said. ""She was tearful,"" he added. ""She wasn't hysterical."" A key part of the case involves a confrontation between Lazarus and Rasmussen at the hospital where Rasmussen worked, but Overland insisted his client was no stalker. By some accounts, Lazarus allegedly told her rival: ""If I can't have him, nobody can."" While Overland acknowledged there was a meeting between the two women, he described it as more of a heads-up. The message from Lazarus, according to her attorney: ""Hey, if he's dating you, you'd better tell him to stop bothering me. He keeps calling me. Tell him to knock it off."" At the time of the slaying, Lazarus was in her second year with the Los Angeles Police Department. The killing occurred on a Monday. Lazarus had taken the day off; Rasmussen had called in sick that morning. Authorities estimate she died before lunchtime. Ruetten found the body when he came home from work after 6 that night. Wearing a red robe, pink T-shirt and black panties, Rasmussen was sprawled on her back on the living room floor. By all accounts, the grim find left Ruetten dazed and despondent. Lazarus was a newbie patrol officer when Ruetten broke up with her for good. She was hurt by his rejection, sure, but she moved on and prospered, Overland said. She made detective and met her husband, a fellow Los Angeles police detective, in 1993, and they have a daughter. She was headed for the department's internal affairs and its prestigious art theft detail. According to prosecutors, the key to unlocking Lazarus' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner's office. A sealed evidence envelope contained a vial. Inside that vial was a cotton swab. On that swab, prosecutors say, was DNA taken from saliva from the bite wound on Rasmussen's left forearm. Testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman. But still some detectives clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers. From the beginning, the victim's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of Ruetten's who was a cop, and as the DNA testing advanced, undercover police followed Lazarus to a Costco store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can. Saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark DNA, and she officially became a suspect. Lazarus was confronted, and another sample was taken from her shortly before her arrest. Tests revealed the DNA found in the bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm belonged to Lazarus. How sure were they? Presby said the chances of the killer being anyone else is ""one in 1.7 sextillion."" That's a 17 followed by 20 zeroes. Overland says the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and can't be trusted. The envelope has been torn. Photos show the top of the vial poking through. And while the top of the envelope may have been sealed with red crime lab tape, the bottom was wide open. Overland quoted the crime lab's supervisor, who observed: ""We've got a problem."" Hairs, fibers and fingerprints found at the crime scene can't be tied to Lazarus at all and haven't been matched to anyone else, Overland told the jury. The jurors listened intently Monday but didn't take many notes. As prosecutors set the scene with their first witnesses, the images projected on a large screen were jarring: A beaming bride in white appeared one minute, followed by an image of a bloodied corpse in a red robe, arms and legs stiffened with rigor mortis. Both photos were of Rasmussen, and they were taken less than four months apart. Her father, Nels Rasmussen, occasionally choked back sobs, and one of the victim's sisters teared up at the sight of the bloodied face with one eye blackened and swollen shut. Sherri Rasmussen ""wore the white dress that the defendant felt was hers,"" Presby said. ""Four months after that marriage, Sherri Rasmussen was dead, her beauty disfigured, obliterated, blotted from existence."" Lazarus, dressed in black for court, appeared pale and waxy as she jotted notes and whispered with her attorneys. During breaks, she waved at her husband, mother and brother, who were seated behind her. Presby reminded jurors what life was like in 1986. Ronald Reagan was president. Bill Cosby had the top-rated television show. People played Pong and Asteroids and hardly anybody had a home computer. And few, except for scientists, had heard of DNA. The genetic testing that is now the ""gold standard of evidence,"" was yet to come, Presby reminded the jury. ""A tiny Stephanie Lazarus was hiding in the bite on Sherri Rasmussen's arm,"" he said. The O.J. Simpson trial in 1994 and 1995 helped cement DNA as a household word. Ten years later, the Los Angeles Police Department launched its cold case squad, reopening hundreds of files to see, as Presby said, ""if there were more killers hiding on evidence shelves in coroners' freezers."" It will be up to eight women and four men to decide if Lazarus is one of them.","Trial of former Los Angeles police detective Stephanie Lazarus is under way .

"(CNN) -- After a setback from the natural and nuclear disasters of 2011, tourism has rebounded in Tokyo. The Japan National Tourism Office reports a 21% increase in visitor arrival numbers between January and August 2013 compared with the same period last year. The renewed surge of visitors is being partly attributed to Tokyo's successful bid for the 2020 Olympics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to bulk up the economy. Fall is the classic time to visit the city. The oppressive humidity of summer has cleared, autumn colors bring life to Tokyo's many parks, hearty, seasonal foods are the order of the day and the fresh fashion the country is known for is celebrated on the streets. More: Guide to Tokyo's best parks . From sedate, centuries-old gardens to boisterous robot cabarets, here's the vital knowledge you'll need before hitting Japan's sprawling capital. 1. Tip No. 1: Don't tip . Attentive service is the norm in Japan, part of a cultural dedication to hospitality called omotenashi. Tipping isn't expected in taxis, at hair salons, for doormen or bartenders. Not only are gratuities not expected, they won't be accepted. Some restaurant checks will include a service charge. If you leave money behind, no matter how much or little, don't be surprised if your server chases you down the street to return it. More: 50 reasons Tokyo is the world's greatest city . 2. Walk right -- on the left . With 35 million people, greater Tokyo is one of the most densely populated urban centers in the world. Yet crowds are orderly. Everyone waits until the light changes to cross the street. Pedestrians on wide sidewalks follow the unspoken rule of staying to the left almost as strictly as cars (also on the left) do. Exception: On Tokyo escalators, stand on the left and walk on the right. (Around Osaka, escalator etiquette is reversed.) 3. Drink outside, smoke inside . The more enclosed a space is, the more likely you'll be allowed to smoke there. The smaller and homier a bar or restaurant, the more likely it is to be smoker-friendly. Many bullet trains still have smoking cars. On the other hand, smoking is prohibited on many sidewalks (look for signs stenciled on the sidewalk), except around public ashtrays. Street patrols stop people who engage in aruki-tabako, or ""walking-smoking."" Cracking open a beer or can of fruity, boozy chu-hai on the walk or train home, however, is a cherished tradition. More: 5 Tokyo bars for train nerds (yes, they exist) 4. One card is good for all trains and buses . The Tokyo train system is actually a network of three train companies. Originally, each system required its own tickets. Now rechargeable Suica and Pasmo cards let riders seamlessly touch their way in and out of all lines. As of March 2013, paying fares got even easier -- a single card became usable for trains and buses throughout the country. You can get one as soon as you arrive in Tokyo from almost any ticket machine. The ¥500 deposit (a little over $5) for the card is refundable. The time you save not calculating ticket costs makes it worthwhile even if you keep the card as a souvenir. 5. There are pockets of quiet everywhere . From temples hidden between office buildings (Hanazono Shrine in Shinjuku is a favorite of these) to the tree-lined canal that runs the length of Nakameguro, you're never far from an oasis of calm in the frantic city. Winding residential streets lined with walled gardens are often just a block away from busy main roads. If you take a detour down a little unmarked road (most Japanese streets are unnamed) chances are you'll discover a tiny cafe, quirky neighborhood art project or a jumble of ultramodern condos and rickety ancient architecture. More: Insider Guide: What to do in Tokyo . 6. Japanese bathhouses . Public bathhouses, or sento, are a soothing holdover from a time when most homes didn't have bathtubs. Whether it's a bright, modern place in Omotesando with fizzy water and fancy soap or a creaky neighborhood bath with a coin-operated hairdryer that's been bolted to the floor since the 1960s, all public baths cost ¥450. The Tokyo Sento Association is redoubling efforts to make them foreigner friendly ahead of the Olympics by posting etiquette and instruction cards in four languages. 7. That word you keep hearing is 'welcome' After a few days in Tokyo, you might find yourself asking, ""What's that thing they always say when I walk in?"" Whether it's sweaty, aproned guys shouting in unison as you walk into an izakaya (lively restaurants that serve alcohol with lots of small dishes) or one perfectly coiffed woman murmuring as you enter the hush of a small boutique, they're saying the same thing: ""Irasshaimase."" It's a polite way of saying ""welcome."" Although your instinct may be to reply -- ""Thank you?"" ""Hello?"" -- locals insist no response is required. A friendly little bow in response doesn't hurt, though. 8. The sushi really is that good . The famous tuna auction at Tsukiji market starts just after 5 a.m., but the day's 120 free tickets are often all snapped up as early as 4. Whether you get to the auction or not, the market and surrounding shops will be springing to life around that time -- it's the best place to enjoy an early morning plate of the freshest sushi you've ever tasted. You need not be there that early, but many of the hundreds of shops start to close by 1 p.m. Visit and you, too, will be one of those insufferable diners who can't eat sushi back home without saying, ""It's good, but it's nothing like the maguro I had in Japan."" But hurry -- the legendary market is set to close at the end of 2013. A new facility will open a few kilometers away in 2014. More: Iconic fish market to close . 9. Free WiFi is rare . While the number of places that have free and simple WiFi in Japan is increasing, access isn't something you can count on. Signs everywhere announce free WiFi -- if you already have a contract with the provider. Even places like Starbucks that have relatively accessible free WiFi require you to create an account in advance. Instead of renting a SIM card, many travelers find that renting a pocket WiFi at the airport to use with their own smartphones is the best way to get online. 10. Bacon turns up everywhere . Japan has a long tradition of Buddhist vegetarian cuisine called shojin ryori. It is painstakingly prepared and served on fine lacquerware and ceramics. It's worth experiencing (Michelin-starred Itosho is outstanding) and guaranteed to be vegetarian, but it's expensive and a time-consuming affair. For a quick veggie meal, you usually have to be vigilant. A ""vegetable sandwich"" may have a sneaky slice of ham in it, and pasta with ""no meat"" could be studded with chunks of bacon. ""Meat"" tends to mean ""beef."" Running down a list of every animal product that you'd like to avoid is the only way to be sure. And your potato salad might still come with bacon. 11. Clear umbrellas are the best umbrellas . Into every vacation a little rain must fall. If you're in Japan when it does, lucky you -- it's a perfect opportunity to pick up a clear umbrella. It's such a simple innovation, you wonder why they haven't caught on elsewhere. Once the first drops of rain hit the street, you'll find them everywhere. Convenience stores will put their stock by the door. One costs between ¥300 and ¥500. The clerk will offer to unwrap it for you if you're using it right away. Hold on tightly, but let go lightly; umbrellas are the one item that's frequently stolen in Tokyo. If yours disappears, consider it a rite of passage.

"This time it was the United States that gave up the dramatic goal. Portugal's Silvestre Varela scored on a strong headed goal deep, deep in stoppage time to give Portugal a desperate 2-2 draw with the United States in a key Group G World Cup match at Manaus, Brazil. The goal, in the 95th minute, came off a cross from Cristiano Ronaldo, who showed no signs of a knee injury that was the subject of much media attention in the buildup to the contest. Second-half strikes by U.S. midfielder Jermaine Jones and striker Clint Dempsey had given the United States a 2-1 lead until Portugal rescued its World Cup chances. ""You're disappointed not to get three points, but at the same time you have to take the positives from the game,"" Dempsey said. ""We're happy with four points, and there's everything to play for in the last game."" The United States plays co-group leader Germany on Thursday while Ghana and Portugal square off. The Americans will win the group with a victory, but could also advance to the Round of 16 with a draw and a tie in the other match, which will be played at the same time. But if Ghana or Portugal wins and the other match also has a winner, tiebreakers --  the first being goal differential -- will determine the second-place team in the group. ""We gave our maximum,"" Ronaldo said, according to a CNN translation. ""We're obviously frustrated and sad with what happened."" The Portugal star wasn't counting on getting the arduous results his team needs Thursday to advance. ""There aren't miracles in football. We knew it was a difficult group. Either we could qualify or we'd get knocked out,"" he said. ""Honestly, I never thought we were going to be the world champion. Anything can happen, now we have to be humble."" Time to rally . The American goals made up for an early U.S. miscue that allowed Portugal to take a 1-0 lead when Nani scored after a U.S clearance attempt went awry. U.S. defender Geoff Cameron tried to knock away a cross, but the ball went to a wide-open Nani, who waited for U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard to go down, then slammed home a shot from 6 yards in the fifth minute. ""You never want to get scored on, but it was good for us,"" said U.S. midfielder Kyle Beckerman, who thought the Americans picked up their play immediately after the goal. Jones scored a sweet goal after Portugal cleared a U.S. corner. The German-born player took a couple of touches that unleashed a wicked bending shot that left Portugal goalkeeper Beto standing helplessly still in the 64th minute. Dempsey scored in the 81st minute when midfielder Graham Zusi sent a ball toward goal that the U.S. star redirected into the net. Portugal, the fourth-ranked team in the world and one of the pre-tournament favorites in Group G, outshot the Americans 20 to 15. But Howard had four saves, including one that kept the U.S. from going down two goals. After a Nani shot ricocheted off the post, Howard swept away a rebound from Eder while reaching over his left shoulder. ""I don't think Portugal broke us down. I think we in a way let ourselves down,"" said Howard, who was named man of the match. ""So that's kind of a good sign because had we gotten torn apart, it would have been a lot tougher."" Lineup changes . The Portuguese team was missing defender Pepe through a red card suspension and striker Hugo Almeida and defender Fabio Coentrao, who were injured. Dempsey was playing with a broken nose that he said made it hard to breathe in the Americans' 2-1 dramatic win over Ghana on a late goal by substitute John Brooks. After the match, he said he made it through Sunday's contest without problems. The United States was missing striker Jozy Altidore, who has a strained left hamstring. Dempsey, normally a midfielder, moved to the top of the U.S. formation in Altidore's place while Zusi slid into the starting lineup. The game was played in the heat and humidity of the Amazon rainforest. The heat index was 93 degrees at kickoff, and the weather seemed to have an effect on the pace of the game as the match moved into the second 45 minutes. The referee even allowed a short water break in the first half, a first in a World Cup match. The second half was played at a much more measured pace until after the U.S. goals, when Portugal attacked with more intensity, searching for the score that would keep it from being eliminated from the tournament. The Americans, 13th in the FIFA rankings, were cheered on by about 20,000 red, white and blue fans at Arena Amazonia. The United States and Portugal are the final two of the 32 teams to play their second match. Monday features four matches, two in Group A and two in Group B, as several teams battle for spots and seedings in the next round while others that have been eliminated let some reserves get in a World Cup match.","U.S. was seconds from winning before Portugal's Silvestre Varela scored off Ronaldo cross .

"(CNN) -- The Italian and French governments were both trying to defuse an escalating diplomatic row Monday after France refused entry to a train carrying North African migrants from Italy. Italy complained to France on Sunday after authorities blocked a train with Tunisian migrants from the border city of Ventimiglia entering Menton on the Cote d'Azur. The Tunisians had been issued resident permits by Italy, allowing them to travel freely in many European countries. French Interior Minister Claude Gueant said Monday in Bucharest that France did not want any continuing tensions with Rome regarding the train incident. Gueant said Rome's decision to give temporary resident permits to more than  25,000 Tunisian migrants arriving in Italy since January had been ""heavily contested by many countries in the European Union."" Some 300 French and Italian protestors from a group named ""Train for dignity,"" were also aboard the train in a show of support for the 60 Tunisians who were hoping to enter France. Gueant said that although France accepted this decision, there were conditions - namely that the migrants had to prove they could support themselves financially. Since the mass political unrest started in North Africa and other Arab states in January, a large number people have fled Tunisia and Libya to Europe, where governments have been trying to prevent a refugee crisis. Italy's coast guard said at least 1,623 migrants landed on the island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period in mid-March alone. Italy's foreign minister has estimated that as many as 300,000 Libyans could try to leave and could potentially end up in his country. Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata in Libya and on Monday the UK Department for International Development (DFID) said that it would help 5,000 migrants trapped by fighting in western Libya. The DFID said £1.5 million ($2.43 million) would be made available to charter ships to get people out of the rebel-held town of Misrata and transfer them to Benghazi. Andrew Mitchell, the UK International Development Secretary, said his department would help fund their evacuation in ships chartered by the International Organization for Migration, which says the majority of unauthorized immigrants arriving in Lampedusa are Tunisian. Italy for its part has issued temporary resident permits to thousands of Tunisian migrants and the country on Sunday said it was angered after trains were stopped at the border for around six hours until traffic resumed later that evening. However, at a briefing with journalists Monday, a spokesman for the Italian Foreign Minister Maurizio Massari, tried to play down the issue: ""The situation was clarified and the incident resolved yesterday (Sunday). On the immigration issue, there is a continuous dialogue taking place between the Interior Ministers of the two countries to deal with the problem. We are working together. There is no tension. We are working together to find steps to take to solve the immigration problem.' According to a spokesman for the French Interior Ministry the border was never closed but circulation was ""temporarily halted in order to avoid any risk of an accident,"" because of an unauthorized protest in support of the Tunisian migrants.

"(CNN) -- American Airlines announced Tuesday it will resume commercial flights into Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Friday, making it the first airline to do so. Commercial flights ended on January 12, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and damaged many of the country's buildings, including some at Toussaint Louverture International Airport, in the capital. The first flight will depart Miami International Airport in Florida at 6:40 a.m., arriving at 8:35 a.m. in Port-au-Prince, American Airlines said in a news release. ""This is that crack in the dam that we so badly needed and our passengers so badly wanted, to start moving regularly scheduled traffic into and out of Haiti,"" spokesman Tim Smith told CNN Radio. ""We'll start out with three main flights a day from south Florida, two from Miami and one from Fort Lauderdale. Then we'll also fly a JFK New York flight into Haiti four days a week."" Smith said that, despite damage to the airport, the airline was prepared to deal with passengers. ""One of the things we did very soon after the earthquake is that, as we were going in carrying relief supplies, we also sent in some American employees and folks from a construction firm that we worked with on the mainland to actually begin working to repair our facilities there at the Port-au-Prince terminal."" Haitian customs officials will work out of a cargo facility because of damage at the main terminal, Smith said. ""These flights serve as major milestones toward helping the country rebuild,"" Peter Dolara, American's senior vice president for Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America, said in the news release. ""With commercial air service restored, we can better connect loved ones and provide consistent transportation to and from Haiti."" Also beginning March 12, American Eagle will commence new service into Port-au-Prince from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and daily flights from the Dominican Republic cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago. ""We have begun our journey to recover from the catastrophic earthquake, but with support from companies like American Airlines, we hope it won't be nearly as long,"" said Ralph Latortue, consul general of Haiti in Florida. American has served Haiti since 1971 and employs more than 100 people in Port-au-Prince, according to the airline. Since the day after the earthquake, American Airlines and American Eagle have continued flying into and out of Haiti -- carrying relief workers, medical personnel, humanitarian aid and evacuating hundreds of people. A spokeswoman for Spirit Airlines, which had a daily flight from Fort Lauderdale to Port-au-Prince, said the company was working to gain approval to resume its flights beginning Friday. ""We're awaiting the response from the airport,"" said spokeswoman Misty Pinson. A spokesman for Delta Air Lines said it was working with Haitian authorities to reinstate service ""as quickly as possible."" The work on the American Airlines terminal was carried out by Odebrecht, a Sao Paulo, Brazil-based construction company that built American's terminal at Miami International Airport, said spokeswoman Renata Pinheiro. A cargo building that was undamaged by the earthquake was transformed into a terminal, and immigration and customs services were located there, she said. A terminal that suffered only minor damaged was fixed. ""It wasn't a reconstruction of the airport itself, it was really making it operational,"" she said about the effort. The company's workforce of 75 included 30 Haitian baggage handlers who ""became construction helpers,"" she said. ""Odebrecht's people trained them to do welding and painting. The really cool thing that we're super happy about is the fact that the whole thing came about in just three weeks."" Among the toughest challenges was finding construction supplies, the company said in a news release. Odebrecht solved that by obtaining materials in Puerto Rico and sending them by barge to the Dominican Republic, then moving them by truck to the Haitian capital. ""This has been a genuine labor of love, but also one of absolute commitment,"" said Antonio Pinto, Odebrecht's project executive in Haiti. ""In the most basic human terms, it is essential to reopen this airport and to reconnect the people of Haiti with their families and friends abroad."" The company's other projects include rebuilding and fortifying levees in New Orleans, Louisiana, under contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.","American will resume service Friday morning .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ""knows our position loud and clear"" on the punishment of the victim of a gang rape. President Bush said he would be angry with a state that did not support a rape victim. However, Bush said he did not recall having raised the issue during a recent telephone conversation with the king. The woman was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by being alone with an unrelated man before the rape. The president said during a White House news conference that upon learning of the case, ""My first thoughts were these: What happens if this happened to my daughter? How would I react? And I would have been ... I would have been very emotional, of course. ""I'd have been angry at those who committed the crime. And I would be angry at a state that didn't support the victim. ""And our opinions were expressed by [White House press secretary] Dana Perino from the podium."" Asked whether he personally had pressed King Abdullah about the matter, Bush responded, ""I talked to King Abdullah about the Middle Eastern peace. I don't remember if that subject came up. ... He knows our position loud and clear."" Last month, the Saudi Ministry of Justice said the woman had had an ""illegitimate relationship"" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped by seven men after she and the man she was with were discovered in a ""compromising situation, her clothes on the ground."" The woman, now 19, was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for meeting with the man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was simply retrieving a photograph. When she appealed her sentence, a Saudi court more than doubled it. The rapists initially received sentences ranging from 10 months to five years in prison. After the woman's appeal, the Qatif General Court also increased the sentence for the rapists, to two to nine years in prison. The Justice Ministry had previously said the woman's sentence was increased after evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. The attacks took place in the eastern city of Qatif in March 2006, when the woman was 18 and engaged to be married. Her husband has told CNN that ""from the onset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime. She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes."" Under Saudi Arabia's Islamic law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or undergo surgery. The rape victim's husband, who has not been identified publicly in order to protect the identity of his wife, said he considered his wife's decision to meet with the man ""a bad choice on her part,"" but denied that she had admitted meeting with the man illicitly.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday admitted he made a mistake in handling the nomination of Tom Daschle as his health and human services secretary, saying Daschle's tax problems sent a message that the politically powerful are treated differently from average people. President Barack Obama is interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. Daschle, the former Democratic leader in the U.S. Senate, withdrew earlier Tuesday as news that he failed to pay some taxes in the past continued to stir opposition on Capitol Hill. ""I think I screwed up,"" Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And I take responsibility for it and we're going to make sure we fix it so it doesn't happen again."" Daschle had apologized Monday for what he said were honest mistakes, calling them an embarrassment. The series of errors included improperly reporting $15,000 in charitable donations, failing to list $80,000 in lobbying income due to what Daschle said was a paperwork error, and not reporting as income a car and driver loaned to him by a friend and business associate.  Watch Obama admit mistake » . Daschle recently filed amended tax returns and paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest for 2005 to 2007. Those tax issues, as well as questions over whether work he did after his stint in the Senate amounted to lobbying, gave critics ammunition to question Obama's call for a change of culture in Washington. ""Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics,"" Obama said. ""And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes.""  Watch the full interview with Anderson Cooper » . Obama defended Daschle's original appointment, saying ""nobody was better-equipped to deal both with the substance and policy of health care."" ""He understands it as well as anybody, but also the politics, which is going to be required to actually get it done,"" Obama said. Earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted Daschle's decision to withdraw was made on his own, not as a result of any prodding from the administration. In a written statement, Daschle acknowledged the political problem he had created for the administration. Still, Obama insisted the mistake was his.  Read how CNN analysts assess the situation » . Obama also said he's going to crack down on businesses using taxpayer money to excessively pay executives. He plans a Wednesday announcement of mechanisms to keep that from happening. ""I'm going to be talking about executive compensation and changes we're going to be making there,"" he said. ""We've now learned that people are still getting huge bonuses despite the fact that they're getting taxpayer money, which I think infuriates the public.""  Watch Obama discuss getting tough on executives » . The president also spoke about the struggling economy, the use of the label ""war on terror,"" and lighter topics, including the family dog and his efforts to stop smoking. Thinking about the nation's faltering economy keeps him up at night, Obama said. He also addressed criticism that there is too much spending in the current stimulus package bill written by House Democrats. iReport.com: Was Daschle properly vetted? ""Look, the only measure of my success as president when people look back five years from now or nine years from now is going to be, did I get this economy fixed. I have no interest in promoting a package that doesn't work,"" Obama said. Cooper also asked Obama about reports that he is not using former President Bush's phrase, ""war on terror,"" to refer to the wars in Iraq in Afghanistan. ""Words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds,"" Obama said. ""I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations, but that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community.""  Watch Obama talk about the phrase ""war on terror"" » . Moving on to lighter topics, the president said the first family hasn't decided what type of dog to get, but will wait until spring. Obama, an intermittent smoker, also said he has not smoked on the White House grounds. ""Sometimes it's hard. But, you know, I'm sticking to it,"" Obama said. iReport.com: 'People should give him some slack' Asked about the greatest lesson he'd learned about the presidency from studying about Abraham Lincoln, Obama said: . ""You know, when I think about Abraham Lincoln, what I'm struck by is the fact that he constantly learned on the job. He got better. You know, he wasn't defensive. He wasn't arrogant about his tasks.

"BUCHAREST, Romania (CNN) -- France has agreed to send a battalion of troops to eastern Afghanistan, a NATO spokesman has said. Canadian NATO-led soldiers walk patrol near Kandahar, Afghanistan. James Appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help NATO meet Canada's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar, where Canadian troops are based. Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar. There is a ""clear unity in the alliance"" that the mission in Afghanistan must succeed, Appathurai said. Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces, the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch troops. Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but, he said, the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not ""whether, but when."" Further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume Thursday, he said. U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance. However, Russia -- which is not a NATO member -- has expressed concerns about the former Soviet republics joining NATO, which has already made members of other former Soviet countries Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia's bid, because of Greece's objections. Greece has threatened to veto Macedonia's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name. Athens has long argued that the name Macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace, also, of Greece's most revered ancient warrior, Alexander the Great. The name issue must be resolved by the two countries, Appathurai said. E-mail to a friend .","French move will help NATO meet Canada's Kandahar commitment .

"(CNN) -- Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held in Iran for more than a year, will be released Saturday, Iranian officials said Thursday. An official at Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said earlier Thursday that one of the three would be freed this weekend, after the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, without specifying which one. But Bak Sahraei, a representative for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, told CNN that Shourd was designated for release ""very soon."" The Culture Ministry official said one of Iran's vice presidents will be present when the hiker is released at 9 a.m. Saturday. Shourd, along with Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. Masoud Shafii, the Iranian lawyer who represents the hikers, said he has put in a formal request for the trio's release within the past two weeks. Shafii said he told prosecutors that a year had passed since their arrests and the government had not shown any just cause for their imprisonment, and that Shourd has a medical condition that requires proper care. After the news first broke Thursday, the mothers of all three said they had seen the reports and were ""urgently seeking further information."" ""We hope and pray that the reports are true and that this signals the end of all three of our children's long and difficult detention,"" Cindy Hickey, Nora Shourd and Laura Fattal said in a joint statement. ""Shane, Sarah and Josh are all innocent and we continue to call for their immediate release, so that they can return home together and be reunited with our families."" Upon release, Shourd would be leaving her fiance behind in prison. The families  announced in spring that Shourd and Bauer got engaged in prison and plan to be married when they're both released. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters, ""We don't know, frankly, what Iran is contemplating at this point."" He said the United States was making inquiries through the Swiss government, which represents U.S. interests in Tehran. ""Obviously, if this turns out to be true, this is terrific news,"" Toner said.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Even in the midst of Japan's deepest economic recession since World War II, the country's love hotel industry is thriving. The Style A hotel in Tokyo offers amenities. ""I'd hate to use the term ""recession-proof,"" but it's certainly proven very resilient over the last six to nine months,"" said Steve Mansfield, CEO of New Perspectives, which operates six love, or ""leisure,"" hotels in Japan. One of them, the Bonita Hotel in Isawa, boasts a 257 percent occupancy rate. Rooms can be rented for three to 24 hours. Mansfield's company estimates the industry in Japan pulls in $40 billion a year in revenue. ""It's a natural human desire. Even these days, on the weekend, every love hotel is full of people -- it's hard to get in. You can never stop sexual desire,"" said a woman with her boyfriend in Tokyo, who laughed in embarrassment when asked for her name. Love hotels fill a need for privacy in a country where high population density often means couples have little time alone. Rooms offer a broad assortment of features, including karaoke machines, PlayStation game consoles, DVD players, a variety of cosmetics, customized condoms and indoor-outdoor Jacuzzis.  Watch Morgan Neill's report from inside a love hotel » . Though required by law to have a front desk, most can be rented and entered without talking to a clerk. The days of Japanese being ashamed to enter love hotels are coming to an end, though, Mansfield said. ""Seventy-five percent of our guests are members of our points program,"" he said. ""They carry our points cards, they collect points and they receive gifts. That's something people are very comfortable with, and I think that reflects the customers that we attract."" Takashi Yamamoto, who designs love hotels in Tokyo, agreed. ""The bad image that love hotels had has faded over time. Also, customers started to raise their voices and became more selective about choosing hotels. In response, management has improved."" The flashiest love hotels are found in Osaka, including a Hello Kitty-themed hotel and one with a room featuring a merry-go-round. Tokyo hotels tend to be tamer, focused on winning customers with amenities. The Style A Hotel, for example, offers a suite for $190 that includes a full-size Jacuzzi and a private sauna. Though young couples make up the majority of customers, they are not the only ones. One man, who declined to be named, said: ""I go to love hotels when I'm drunk and don't feel like going home."" Whatever the reasons, the hotels have been doing well enough that Mansfield recently went to London, seeking investors to expand. ""The industry has 25,000 hotels, and through our research we've worked out that 90 percent of owners have five or fewer hotels,"" he said. That fragmentation is a structural inefficiency in the market, he said, one he would like to help correct.","Industry has 25,000 hotels, says Steve Mansfield, CEO of a love hotel operator .

"(CNN) -- It took years to get through -- an increase in the fee airline passengers pay for airport screening and other government-run aspects of aviation security. It takes effect this summer but now already President Barack Obama wants those who travel by air to pick up even more of the security tab. For more than a decade, the so-called 9/11 fee has been $2.50 for a one-way ticket -- or $5 with one or more connections. On a typical round-trip flight with connections, the maximum was $10. Under a bipartisan budget deal signed into law by Obama in January, passengers will pay $5.60 one-way, regardless of connections, beginning July 1. That brings a round-trip fee to $11.20. Now Obama is proposing to raise the fee to $6 for a one-way trip, or $12 for the typical round trip. The increase, the administration says, will make the fees ""more closely reflect the costs of passenger screening and other aviation security services."" The security fee currently brings in about $1.7 billion a year in revenue. By law, the first $250 million is set aside for a fund that provides airport facility modifications and certain security equipment, according to the House Budget Committee. The remaining amount goes to the Transportation Security Administration, but covers only about 30 percent of the agency's aviation-related security costs. Under the current budget plan, the higher fee will raise that number to about 43 percent of the total cost. It is unclear what percentage of the total cost will be covered if the $6 fee becomes standard. But it's also unclear what parts of Obama's budget proposals will be adopted, if any. The Bush and Obama administrations sought for years to raise the fee without success, making the request a staple of annual budget proposals. They were resisted by key lawmakers and the airlines, who consider aviation security a national security priority that government should cover. But Republicans slowly warmed to the idea of a fee increase as a way to cut government spending in an era of fiscal austerity.","First increase in aviation security fee in years takes effect in July .

"Washington (CNN) -- Firebombed. Cyberattacked. Attacked by a shouting mob. That's what happened to Lars Vilks in the week ending May 16. And if you think: ""Well thank goodness my week was a lot quieter,"" think again. The attacks on Vilks were an attack on you too. Lars Vilks is a Swedish cartoonist. In the summer of 2007, he was invited to submit three drawings to an exhibition sponsored by the town of Tallerud. The exhibition's theme: ""the dog in art."" Vilks produced three pencil sketches of street dogs with human faces, the face (Vilks said) of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Even if you don't know the rest of the story, you can easily imagine. In March, police in Ireland arrested seven people on charges of conspiring to murder Vilks. The same day, U.S. law enforcement announced the indictment of an American woman who had attempted to recruit assassins to kill Vilks. Yet Vilks has refused to be intimidated. On Tuesday of this week, Vilks appeared at the University of Uppsalla to lecture on his art and ideas. Two-hundred-fifty people passed through metal detectors to hear him speak. They never got the chance. Vilks opened his talk with a provocative short video that included an image of two nearly naked Iranian gay men wearing masks of Muhammad. At that cue, about 20 rowdies in the crowd shouted, ""Stop the film! Stop the film!"" The rowdies rushed toward the stage. One of them apparently struck Vilks. Police sought to restrain them. After eight or so minutes of chanting, yelling and fist-pumping by the rowdies, the university suspended the performance. You can watch the incident here in a 10-minute YouTube clip. The blogger who writes under the pseudonym Allahpundit directs attention toward two aspects of the confrontation that might be overlooked in the excitement: the ineffectiveness of the police and the passivity of a crowd of spectators who outnumber the protesters by at least 10 to 1. Daily life in Sweden and other European countries is increasingly governed by an unwritten set of rules very different from the country's formal law. The formal law forbids assault and upholds free speech rights. The actual rules of the game, however, concede that certain assaults and certain violations of free speech rights may proceed with impunity. Police arrested two men for disrupting the Vilks event; both were released without charge. Impunity invites further attack. In the aftermath of the Uppsalla University incident, Vilks' website was hacked and firebombs were planted in his house. (Two men have been arrested in connection with the firebombing.) The authorities look the other way in hope of obtaining social peace. This policy does not work, and for two reasons: . First, the policy of impunity emboldens aggressive minorities. Instead of accepting that they must live and let live, these groups get the message they can dominate others by the threat of force. But second, the policy of impunity backfires. While the authorities want quiet, ornery individuals like Lars Vilks are delighted to bust taboos and foment the very confrontations the authorities wish to avoid. Vilks is just one of a multiplying band of deliberate provocateurs who have appeared across Europe over the past five years. Their work may not have much artistic merit, but the issue here is not art but courage. And there will always be enough courageous people to complicate badly the lives of uncourageous authorities. The irony is that these uncourageous authorities would gain much more quiet if they upheld their formal rules. When the rules are clear and enforced, almost everybody will conform to them. Expel one student for disrupting a campus event, and you are unlikely to have to expel a second. But when the authorities declare a ""moral holiday"" (to update an old phrase from the U.S. urban riots of the 1960s), otherwise law-abiding people seize the opportunity. They commit acts of intimidation and violence they would never have dared if law-breaking had been met by immediate sanction and certain punishment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says university attack on cartoonist Lars Vilks should worry everyone .

"(CNN) -- A Frenchwoman kidnapped from her holiday home in northern Kenya and taken to Somalia has died, the French Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. A gang of 10 armed men seized Marie Dedieu this month from her home on Manda Island, prompting a sea battle between Kenyan forces and her abductors. Kenyan officials sent mediators into Somalia a day later to negotiate her release. Dedieu lived in a luxury home on the scenic Lamu archipelago for about six months out of the year. Kenyan officials and an acquaintance said the woman, in her 60s, used a wheelchair and was not in good health. ""The contacts through which the French government was trying to release Marie Dedieu ... have announced her death,"" the ministry said in a statement, adding the date and circumstances of the death cannot be specified. The ministry said Dedieu's death ""is almost sure"" even if it does not have her body. ""She was an ill and disabled woman,"" Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said. ""This is therefore a deeply barbaric and violent act. France condemns firmly this act."" ""Marie Dedieu's health, the uncertainty about the conditions of her detention, the fact that the abductors had probably refused to give her the medication we had sent her, make us think that this tragic end is unfortunately the most plausible one,"" the ministry statement said. Dedieu's friends and relatives have been notified, it said. ""The French government wants to say that it is deeply moved, saddened and that it supports Marie Dedieu's relatives,"" the statement said. ""The government also wants to express its indignation following the complete lack of humanity and cruelty from the abductors of our compatriot. We want them to be identified and brought to justice."" The statement said the government is requesting ""the repatriation of our compatriot's body."" The Kenyan government sent its condolences to Dedieu's ""family, friends and colleagues"" in a statement Wednesday. ""The kidnapping and detention of Marie Dedieu was a terror act not only against her, but also against Kenya, her home country France and the entire world,"" the statement said. ""... The Kenyan government thanks the French government and the people of France for their continued support even during this moment of loss."" Dedieu's abduction was the second in the area in a month, a major blow to Kenya, which relies on tourism dollars. Gunmen seized British tourist Judith Tebbutt and killed her husband near Lamu last month. Security analysts have said Tebbutt is being held by pirates in a remote corner of Somalia. British government officials have asked journalists not to reveal her exact location to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs. France and Britain warned travelers to avoid the Kenyan coastline near Somalia in the wake of the abductions. Kenyan officials have said they believe the kidnappings are carried out by the Al-Shabaab Somali militant group. A third incident involved the kidnapping of two Spanish aid workers at the Dadaab refugee camp last week. Kenyan forces crossed into Somalia this week to pursue the militant fighters after the kidnappings heightened tensions in East Africa. In the statement Wednesday, the Kenyan government said operations against Al-Shabaab were continuing.","NEW: The Kenyan government sends condolences over Marie Dedieu's death .

"(CNN) -- A person who is brain dead may appear alive -- there may be a heartbeat, they may look like they're breathing, their skin may still be warm to the touch. But doctors say there is no life when brain activity ceases. Doctors in Oakland, California, declared 13-year-old Jahi McMath to be brain dead on December 12, three days after she underwent a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. The McMath family fought in court to keep the teen on a ventilator, and announced Monday that they had moved the girl to another care facility. While family attorney Christopher Dolan told reporters that for her safety, Jahi's destination won't be announced, a New York facility said Sunday it was ready to accept her. ""We are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care,"" said Allyson Scerri, founder of New Beginnings Community Center in Medford, New York. ""Her brain needs time to heal."" ""This child has been defined as a deceased person yet she has all the functional attributes of a living person despite her brain injury,"" the center said on its website. When routine surgeries go wrong . However, barring a misdiagnosis, medical experts say the teen will not recover if she is truly ""brain dead."" While laymen tend to use the words ""coma"" and ""brain dead"" interchangeably, in medicine they mean very different things. ""Coma"" is the broader term used to describe a prolonged state of unconsciousness, according to the Mayo Clinic. Outwardly, it resembles sleep. Doctors may sometimes purposefully put a patient into a coma to give the brain time to heal. Comas rarely last longer than a couple of weeks, according to the clinic; patients can fully regain consciousness or may transition from a coma into a persistent vegetative state. Someone in a persistent vegetative state has lost most higher cognitive function, but his or her brain shows some activity. The patient may open their eyes or exhibit small movements, but cannot speak or respond to commands, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some patients can recover from this state, according to the NIH. Both these situations are different from brain death: According to the Uniform Determination of Death Act, an individual is dead when he or she ""has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem."" What that essentially means is that the brain, an extremely complex organ, no longer helps the patient function. The human brain is divided into what doctors call the Lower Brain and the Upper Brain. The Lower Brain -- where the top of the spinal cord goes up through our necks and into our brains -- regulates body functions such as spontaneous breath, reflexes, our heartbeat, body temperature and sleep/wake cycles. The Upper Brain is behind all the ""higher"" functions in a person's nervous system. This gives us the ability to use our senses -- to see, taste, smell, hear and feel. ""Brain death"" means both the upper and lower part of the brain are not functioning. That command center of the body that regulates the central nervous system is unable to perform. However, some function, such as a heartbeat, may linger. ""It's a little difficult for a layperson to understand how a person is dead if the heart is still beating,"" said Dr. Panayiotis Varelas, director of the neurosciences intensive care service at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital. But without brain function, the body eventually shuts down, unless there is medical intervention. Someone on a ventilator may appear to be breathing, but cannot breathe on their own. While the heart usually stops within 72 hours, it could continue beating for ""a week or so,"" Varelas said. Jahi's mother, Nailah Winkfield, has said, ""I would probably need for my child's heart to stop to show me that she was dead. Her heart is still beating, so there's still life there."" The term ""brain dead"" can be misleading, said Cynda Hylton Rushton, professor of clinical ethics at Johns Hopkins University, because it sounds like a person really isn't dead. If someone dies of a heart attack, doctors don't say they're ""cardiovascular dead,"" for example. Doctors should be more transparent about the finality of brain death, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center. Terms such as ""mechanical support"" or ""artificial machine support"" should be used to refer to sustaining the functioning of a brain dead person, he said. ""No one wants to take away 'life support.'"" ""Dead is dead,"" agreed neurologist Dr. Richard Senelick in The Atlantic. ""Brain death isn't a different type of death, and patients who meet the criteria of brain death are legally dead."" The American Academy of Neurology updated its brain death guidelines for adults in 2010, asking doctors to follow a step-by-step checklist of some 25 tests. All criteria in the guidelines must be met before a person can be considered brain dead; however, the legal definition of brain death can vary from state to state. The American Academy of Pediatrics added to those guidelines for children. These childrens' guidelines advise there should be two attending physicians involved in the care of the child, and they should make separate examinations separated by an observation period. Both must determine the child is brain dead. In making that ruling, the doctors use the currently established criteria; there must not be a conflict of interest. ""No one who has met the criteria for brain death has ever survived,"" Senelick said. ""No one.""

"Once known as the ""Hollywood Madam,"" Heidi Fleiss in recent years has become known as a fan of exotic birds. That interest, parlayed into a 2011 Animal Planet reality show, ""Heidi Fleiss: Prostitutes to Parrots,"" apparently helped spare Fleiss from handcuffs after authorities said they found nearly 400 marijuana plants growing at her residence in Pahrump, Nevada. A deputy did not arrest Fleiss because she had exotic birds valued at more than $200,000, Nye County Sheriff Anthony De Meo told CNN on Tuesday. ""We don't have facilities for exotic birds, and they are pretty rare and very expensive,"" the sheriff said. Authorities said they sent their report to the district attorney for charges to be filed. A deputy went to the home on August 7 to look for another woman wanted on an arrest warrant. The officer, finding the front door open and no one responding, went to the rear of the main residence and spied some of the plants, the sheriff's department said in a statement. Officers encountered Fleiss, who allegedly gave them consent to search another area. She told detectives she was growing the plants to sell to a cooperative in Las Vegas, about 55 miles to the east, authorities said. ""Ms. Fleiss could not produce the necessary documentation to support this. Later she admitted, in a roundabout way, that she was going to get a license because she did not have one,"" the statement said. Another factor in not arresting Fleiss was her consent to a search without a warrant and the fact that she was cooperative, the department said. A total of 392 suspected marijuana plants were counted, authorities said. Fleiss grabbed headlines in the 1990s after she was arrested in connection with a high-priced prostitution ring serving Tinseltown's rich and famous. CNN was unable Tuesday to find a phone listing for the residence. There was no answer at what is believed to be Fleiss' mobile number. CNN also left a message with a publicist known to represent her in 2011. Pals of suburban mom help her make $500,000 bail in pot case .","Authorities search Nevada home of Heidi Fleiss .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel agreed to release a notorious killer Sunday in order to bring closure to the families of three missing military men, a government spokesman said. An Israeli woman stands in front of posters of captured soldiers Sunday in Jerusalem. ""It's not an easy decision,"" Mark Regev told CNN. ""One of the people being released is a brutal murderer, a man that with his own hands killed infants -- a terrible crime, but this is a nasty business."" He was referring to Samir Kuntar, the longest-serving Lebanese prisoner in Israel, who is hailed as a hero by Hezbollah. Kuntar was convicted for a 1979 attack in which he shot and killed an Israeli man in front of his 4-year-old daughter before smashing her head against a rock  and tossing her into the sea. The victim's 2-year-old daughter was accidentally smothered by her mother, who tried to keep her quiet as they hid from the attackers. Kuntar was convicted for murdering both children in the attack, which the Palestine Liberation Front orchestrated to protest the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty at Camp David the previous year. Kuntar is one of five Lebanese prisoners who Israel will release in exchange for two Israeli soldiers, Ehud ""Udi"" Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. The Lebanon-based Shiite militant group kindapped the two in a July 2006 raid into northern Israel that left three other Israeli soldiers dead. Hezbollah never gave Israel any indication whether they survived the attack, which sparked a 34-day war, leaving the families in limbo. Before the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his Cabinet that the two soldiers are not alive, ""as far as we know."" ""We'll have a final answer when they are returned,"" Regev said. Goldwasser and Regev are at the center of the landmark agreement, which has been years in the making, with both sides using the prisoners and intelligence as bartering chips. Under the deal, which the Cabinet approved 22-3 on Sunday, Hezbollah will also release information about Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who has been missing since he was forced to eject from his plane over Lebanon in October 1986. ""We have an obligation, a moral obligation to their families to bring finality,"" Regev said. ""That if they are in fact no longer living, that their families can have a funeral, that they can have a grave, that they can know that this is over."" Israel has repeatedly attempted to get information about Arad and other missing airmen by using Lebanese detainees as leverage. Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised the Arad family that Kuntar will not be released unless Hezbollah provides information on Arad. In addition to Kuntar and other Lebanese prisoners, Israel will also release Palestinian prisoners and return the remains of dozens of border infiltrators and eight Hezbollah members to Lebanon, according to a statement from the government. Israel will also provide information to the United Nations about four Iranian diplomats who disappeared in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion, the statement said. Earlier this month, Israel deported a Lebanese-born man who served six years in jail on charges of spying for Hezbollah. In exchange, Hezbollah handed over a brown coffin containing the remains of Israeli soldiers killed during the 2006 war. The move was seen as a prelude to a possible prisoner swap between Israel and Hezbollah.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- No matter what daily newspaper you picked up in Pakistan on Thursday, the headline was on the fallout from the WikiLeaks cables. ""WikiLeaks throws tons of dirt, shame on Pak players,"" read the front page of the English daily The News. The headline on Dawn news said: ""WikiLeaks bombs rock Islamabad."" Pakistani newspapers devoted much of their coverage to the leaked cables that revealed intense mistrust between Washington and Islamabad and deep rifts among Pakistan's most powerful figures, whose statements behind closed doors didn't always match what they said in public. ""These intimate details reveal that relations between Pakistan and the US on the one hand and between top politicians of the country on the other hand are based on total hypocrisy and shamelessness and no one is sincere to any one, neither can anyone be trusted, whether speaking publicly or privately,"" read a column in The News. A column in Dawn news said this: ""That the former top American diplomat in Pakistan thinks the US policy towards this country risks destabilizing` the Pakistani state is, quite frankly, extraordinary. It goes to the heart of the tensions between the two countries, where Pakistan has, sometimes legitimately, though often unfairly, been labeled as a duplicitous and unreliable partner."" ""With such leadership, both political and military, Pakistan's future is really bleak. Whom should we trust? Who is free from the US influence? Can we become a sovereign nation? Can we take our own decisions? Why do we have more faith in Washington than in God?"" read another column in The News. If Pakistanis ran out of columns to read about the leaked cables, there was plenty of television to watch. Coverage of the WikiLeaks dumps dominated Pakistan's dozens of news channels where anchors unleashed sneers and jeers. ""What kind of a democratic government is this where all the decisions are made by either the US or the military?"" asked anchor Meher Bukhari on her show on Urdu language Samaa TV. On his show on GEO TV, Pakistan's most well known TV anchor Hamid Mir said: ""Look at our military chief General Kayani. He seems to be the top politician in the country."" Azhar Abbas, the managing director of Karachi based GEO News, told CNN the leaked cables didn't reveal anything Pakistanis didn't know. It was the backroom details that made it good TV, he said.

"New Orleans (CNN) -- A titanic courtroom showdown with billions of dollars in the balance opened in New Orleans on Monday, with oil giant BP arguing it shouldn't face the government's steepest penalties for the 2010 Gulf oil spill. BP already pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a record-setting $4 billion fine for the spill. But it could face more than $20 billion in additional environmental penalties if found to have committed gross negligence in the disaster. In a packed federal courtroom Monday afternoon, BP attorney Mike Brock said blame for the disaster wasn't the oil company's alone. A string of bad decisions by Transocean, the company that owned the doomed drill rig Deepwater Horizon; well cement contractor Halliburton; and BP all led to the blowout, he said. ""We do not believe that men and women of BP behaved in willful misconduct,"" Brock said. ""It was a multiparty event."" But Halliburton attorney Don Godwin said BP ignored the contractor's recommendations about the cement job and that Transocean didn't move fast enough to contain the blowout. Transocean settled with the government last week for $1 billion in Clean Water Act penalties but could face additional additional liability in the case that started Monday. Transocean lawyer Brad Brian said that last week's settlement was not an admission of gross negligence and that last-minute changes to the well design by BP had the rig's crew ""at wits' end"" before the disaster. All three companies have been pointing fingers at each other since the April 20, 2010, blowout that sank the Deepwater Horizon, killed 11 men aboard and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed for nearly three months. The spill's effects on the environment are still being cataloged. The plaintiffs in the civil case that opened Monday include five Gulf states, individuals, businesses and the federal government. ""Evidence will show BP placed huge financial pressure to cut costs, cut corners, and rush the job,"" attorney James P. Roy, who represents the coalition of plaintiffs, said during opening arguments on Monday. And Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said the oil giant ""was blinded by their bottom line."" ""The spill was tragically inevitable due to BP's corporate culture,"" Strange said. ""The evidence will show that, at BP, money mattered most."" If it is found to have been ""grossly negligent"" under the Clean Water Act, it could be fined as much as $4,300 per barrel of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. If it's found ""negligent,"" the company could be fined about $1,100 per barrel. Attorneys will also likely square off over how much oil gushed into the gulf, another key figure that will be used to calculate how much money BP might owe. Officials have said 4.9 million barrels -- about 205 million gallons -- of oil spilled, while BP says that number is overblown and that authorities should use a maximum figure of 3.1 million barrels of oil when calculating the fine. The trial will also determine what fines the company faces under National Resource Damage Assessment, which aims to restore environmental damage caused by the spill. Environmental groups want to see those fines -- which will put a specific price tag on damage to plants and wildlife -- total around $25 billion. With so much money at stake, each side has brought an army of lawyers to the fight. With almost 60 lawyers filling the courtroom, the judge created a seating chart for all the attorneys. Lawyers representing the federal government and other plaintiffs sat on one side, while the BP lawyers and other companies' lawyers sat across the room. Three overflow courtrooms were also packed on Monday. BP says it has already paid billions in spill-related cleanup and compensation costs and has been barred from new federal contracts. Though Halliburton and Transocean could also face penalties, much of the criticism from environmentalists before the high-profile trial has focused on BP, the undersea well's owner. ""The damage done here is real, both to the environment and to the people,"" said Brian Moore, of the National Audubon Society. ""And BP should not have the chance to get off cheaply on this."" In his statement before the trial began, BP General Counsel Rupert Bondy said the company would push for the court to consider lower penalties, arguing that BP made efforts to do the right thing and ""immediately stepped up"" and acknowledged its role in the spill. ""To date we've spent more than $23 billion in response, cleanup, and payments on claims by individuals, businesses and governments,"" he said. ""No company has done more, faster, to meet its commitment to economic and environmental restoration efforts in the wake of an industrial accident."" CNN's Vivian Kuo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: The Gulf oil spill was ""a multiparty event,"" BP lawyer argues .

"Christopher Columbus and his discovery of the Americas in 1492 is one of the great stories of modern history. But five centuries after his momentous achievement, a British explorer wants to prove that Columbus was actually beaten to it by another seafaring nation 1,000 years earlier. Philip Beale believes the ancient Phoenicians - a Semitic civilization that prospered between 1500BC and 300BC on the Mediterranean coast - sailed to the Americas first. Explorer Philip Beale, left, wants to prove that the ancient civilisation the Phoenicians discovered America before Christopher Columbus in 1492, right . Mr Beale built The Phoenician in 2008 exactly as it would have been 2,600 years ago . And the former City fund manager from . Lulworth, Dorset, wants to prove it by sailing a replica boat he built . exactly as it would have been 2,600 years ago across the Atlantic. 'It . is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done . it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians,' Beale told CNN. 'Of . all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- . Lebanon had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats, they were the . first to use iron nails, and they had knowledge of astrology and . currents.' The Phoenician covered more than 20,000 miles when Mr Beale sailed it around Africa in 2008 . The theory that . an Israelite race discovered the Americas before Columbus was popular in . the 18th and 19th centuries after several ancient inscriptions were . found in North America which were said to be Hebrew. But many historians still doubt that the Phoenicians were capable of such a treacherous journey. Mr . Beale has already been on an epic voyage in his 50 tonne wooden vessel - . aptly named The Phoenician - after he sailed it around Africa in 2010. Traveller: Steve Coogan (centre) as Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days with Cecile de France and Jackie Chan . Phileas Fogg is a fictional character who is the star of the 1873 Jules Verne novel 'Around the World in Eighty Days.' In the book, which has been made into several films - including one starring Steve Coogan (above) - Fogg attempts to circumnavigate the world in eighty days, or less, for a wager of £20,000 with members of his London club. He vows to return to the club by 8.45pm on Saturday 21 December 1872. He is followed by a detective named Fix during his journey who suspects him of robbing the Bank of England. While in India Fogg meets Aouda, a widowed princess, and saves her from being burned to death during her husband's funeral. She then travels with Fogg for the rest of his journey. She and Fogg eventually fall in love and marry. Fogg arrives home thinking he has lost his bet - but he eventually finds out that he won. He . hired archaeologists and traditional shipwrights to construct the boat . based on the design of an ancient galley found wrecked in the western . Mediterranean. It is almost 65ft in length, with a single sail and emergency oar holes for when the wind dropped. Then, like a modern-day Phileas Fogg, . he set sail in it to prove that the fabled voyage was possible using . only the power of the wind and the tide. He . wanted to demonstrate that the Phoenicians - referred to in the Bible . as 'rulers of the sea' - had the capability to circumnavigate the . continent 2,000 years before the first recorded European which was . Bartolomeu Dias in 1488. Setting sail from Syria in 2008, he covered 20,000 miles over two years, battling everything from six-metre waves off the Cape of Good Hope to Somali pirates. And now he is willing to do it all again, provided he can raise the £100,000 he needs for the trip. The odyssey is expected to take two to three months, setting sail from Tunisia and arriving in America via the Atlantic Ocean. He has also been invited by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art to be . part of the museum's landmark exhibition on the Phoenician civilisation, . opening in September 2014. 'The conventional wisdom . is that Christopher Columbus discovered America. But anyone who looks a . little closer will see the Vikings were there around 900AD. They've . found Viking settlements in Newfoundland, it's undisputed,' Beale told CNN. 'So Columbus was . definitely second -- at best. I put forward the theory that the . Phoenicians could have been first and I hope to prove that was the . case.'","Former City fund manager Philip Beale built replica Phoenician vessel .

"Washington (CNN)Chris Christie's decision to accept a plane ride and a box seat at Sunday's Dallas Cowboys game has Democrats considering an investigation and even some Republicans questioning the New Jersey governor's judgment. On Wednesday, the co-chairman of the New Jersey legislative panel investigating the Bridgegate scandal told CNN that he is considering an inquiry into whether it was appropriate for the governor to accept free tickets from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones after a company the team has a stake in was awarded a contract supported by Christie. ""It smacks of improper behavior. It smacks of hypocrisy,"" Assemblyman John Wisniewski said. ""It smacks of inside deals that the average guy in Jersey can't ever dream of having the opportunity to do. It's wrong."" Christie, a lifelong Cowboys fan, said through a spokesman that Jones paid for the ticket and transportation to the game. The spokesman said Monday that the governor's code of conduct allows Christie to accept gifts ""from relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds."" But the revelation Tuesday that the Cowboys own part of a company that won a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey contract, which was endorsed by Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, raised questions about a possible quid-pro-quo. Last March, Legends Hospitality, which is owned by the Cowboys, New York Yankees and the Checketts Partners Investment Fund, won the Port Authority contract to operate the observation deck of One World Trade Center. Related: Christie's cowboy's love gets national spotlight . Why would a big state governor with White House ambitions accept lavish gifts from a wealthy patron? That's a question Virginia's former Gov. Bob McDonnell will probably be asking himself as he heads to prison Feb. 9 after being handed a two-year sentence for public corruption conviction on Tuesday. McDonnell accepted cash and gifts from a wealthy businessman with interests in his state. Related: Former Virginia governor gets two years in prison . In the case of Christie and his Cowboys, there's no evidence of any wrongdoing. But Democrats like Brad Woodhouse of the progressive American Democracy Legal Fund are quick to draw the comparison. Woodhouse filed a complaint with the New Jersey State Ethics Commission and the governor's Advisory Ethics Panel this week, arguing that ""Christie's acceptance of gifts from Mr. Jones ... appears to violate at least two separate provisions of New Jersey's Conflicts of Interest Law, the New Jersey Uniform Ethics Code, and the Governor's Code of Conduct."" Christie spokeswoman Maria Comella said that it's not surprising that a partisan organization is ""using the governor's support of a football team for a political hit."" ""The governor does not involve himself in Port Authority bidding processes,"" she said. ""He's only there because he's a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. And Jerry Jones wants him there because he's good luck."" Related: Cowboys, books tours and same-sex marriage . Indeed, Jones told a Dallas radio station Tuesday that, ""He's part of our mojo and I want him there all the way. I'll tell you, if he's got enough mojo to pull this thing out, he ought to be looked at as president of the United States."" But even some Republicans are questioning Christie's decision to watch the game from the owner's box. Former Republican state Sen. Bill Schluter, who served on the State Ethics Commission, said Christie was offered the tickets because of his position as governor, which ""just doesn't pass the smell test."" ""I just wonder if the governor hasn't given up his idea of being president. For him to do this, to go out to Dallas to see this game, doesn't show good judgment,"" he said. It's a point Woodhouse, a former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, echoed. ""It really defies the imagination that someone who sees himself as running for president would act this way,"" he said. ""It doesn't look like someone who's on a national stage ready for primetime.""","New Jersey Gov.

"Islamic State militants are planning to murder 150 Christian hostages they kidnapped after sweeping through villages in Syria if the U.S. does not stop air strikes, it has been reported. The abductions of the Christians took place yesterday after ISIS seized two Assyrian communities from Kurdish forces in the northeast province of Hassakeh. The dawn raids are said to have spread 'panic' in the villages, inhabited by the ancient Christian minority along the banks of the Khabur River near the town of Tel Hmar with most coming from the village of Tal Shamiram. Coptic Christians being held by ISIS fighters in Libya. Now the terror group is reportedly planning to threaten to kill another 150 Christian hostages that were seized in Syria . Most of the captives are said to have came from the village of Tal Shamiram, located 50 miles miles southwest of the Hassakeh provincial capital of Qamishli, with others taken from Tal Hermuz . It is thought that the militants are holding the seized women and children in houses in the ISIS-held town of al-Shadadi and using them as human shields from air strikes. Now CNN has reported that the terror group are now planning to release a video as early as today, where they will threaten to kill the hostages if air strikes don't stop. Osama Edward, founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network told the station that the video will be directed to US President Barack Obama and other members of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. The video is expected to say that the hostages will be killed unless the strikes stop. Meanwhile, it has also been reported that at least 500 families escaped the attack and fled to a nearby church in Hasakah city, where they found refuge. Mr Edward told the IBTimesUK: 'We're involved, many of them are friends and relatives. I'm trying not to get involved and be as objctive and accurate as possible without surrender to personal feelings.' The kidnappings come as ISIS released a video showing militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya earlier this month. The United States has condemned the attack on the Assyrian Christians and demanded their immediate release. It is thought that ISIS militants, pictured,  are holding the seized women and children in houses in the ISIS-held town of al-Shadadi and using them as human shields from air strikes . US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: 'ISIS latest targeting of a religious minority is only further testament to its brutal and inhumane treatment of all those who disagree with its divisive goals and toxic beliefs. 'ISIS continues to exact its evil upon innocents of all faiths, and the majority of its victims have been Muslims. 'To bring an end to these daily horrors, we remain committed to leading the international coalition to degrade and defeat ISIS and to working towards a negotiated political solution that stops the bloodshed and secures a future of freedom, justice, and dignity for all Syrians.' After ISIS attacked the two villages as well as the nearby town of Tal Tamr, which remains under Kurdish control, the jihadists set fire to a church there and then installed fighters in the remains of the building, an activist network reported.

Control of Hassakeh province is largely divided between Kurdish forces, who in some places patrol with regime troops, and ISIS fighters. Since recapturing the strategic border town of Kobane in Aleppo from IS fighters on January 26, Kurdish forces have taken dozens of nearby villages. They have also seized 19 villages from IS in Raqa, where the jihadist group has its de facto capital, and another 30 villages and hamlets in Hassakeh. The Kurdish advances have been aided by the US-led air strikes, including a series in Hassakeh on Monday that killed at least 14 IS fighters, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.","ISIS are reportedly planning to release a video showing Christian hostages .

"It is a scene seared forever into the memory of an eyewitness: . Masked men drag the bloodied body of a man across a public square, and tie it to a make-shift cross on a metal pole. Green string holds the body's arms outstretched across a wood plank as blood oozes from the gunshot wound to his head. Militiamen wrap the body's black ""WhatsApp"" shirt with a sign in red letters that reads in Arabic: ""This man fought Muslims and detonated an IED here."" The eyewitness -- a man we will call Abu Ibrahim -- does more than watch. He steps closer and snaps a picture with his cell phone; the children around him gawk at the horrific spectacle with quiet curiosity. Abu Ibrahim asked that his identity be kept secret for fear of reprisals. His photographs document the story of a body staged to look like a crucifixion -- and to send a message -- in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. An al Qaeda splinter group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), says the brutal display serves as a lesson to anyone who dares challenge its rule. Three days on, the ""crucified"" body of the man and another victim were reportedly still hanging in Raqqa. ""What they are conveying is those who oppose ISIS rule oppose God's rule, and those who are enemies of ISIS are enemies of God and deserve the highest form of punishment possible,"" says Abbas Barzegar, assistant professor of Islamic studies at Georgia State University. The jihadist group carried out a total of seven public executions in Raqqa on Tuesday, but only two bodies were displayed afterward, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. Abu Ibrahim, a member of a recently formed anti-ISIS activist group in Raqqa, says the remaining five victims were children under the age of 18, one of them a seventh-grade student. The crucifixion displays began in March, when ISIS accused a shepherd of murder and theft, then shot him in the head and tied his lifeless body to a wooden cross. Video on social media showed the body leaning up against a small building painted to bear the group's flag and name. ""These violent acts are part of a fundamentalist revival campaign, but these forms of ancient punishment were rarely if ever seen in the Muslim world in recent centuries,"" Barzegar says. ""It has become a standard feature of fringe Islamist groups to revive these outdated practices in an effort to bring back what they believe is authentic."" There's been no evidence of actual crucifixion, a painful form of execution in which victims were bound or nailed through the hands and feet to a heavy wooden cross and left to suffer until death. All three men in Raqqa were shot in the head prior to being affixed to crosses. The displays of their bodies appear to be largely symbolic acts by ISIS followers against members of their own Sunni Muslim sect for perceived acts of treason. ""ISIS needs to attach meaning to their killing. Simply murdering in a state of constant warfare is void of value, so they must attach a message or propaganda to what they are doing,"" Barzegar says. As Syria's civil war creates a power vacuum, groups like ISIS have stepped in with their own form of radical Sharia law to rule over an exhausted and terrorized civilian population. Edicts often appear overnight on inconspicuous flyers, with dire warnings: . ""All shop owners must close their stores immediately upon the announcement of prayer and go to the mosque,"" a decree posted this week reportedly reads. ""Any violators after the issuance of this announcement will face consequences."" According to a set of rules issued to Raqqa's Christian minority, members of the faith must pay a special tax to the militants and may not expose crosses, repair churches, or recite prayers in the presence of Muslims, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in February. But while crucifixion holds specific biblical resonance, the bold and brutal displays in Raqqa hold no direct correlation to Christian symbolism, Barzegar says. The ISIS victims whose bodies were strung up on crosses were all Muslim. U.N. chief to Syria: Please don't hold presidential elections . After nearly a year under the repression of ISIS, Abu Ibrahim and about 20 other activists formed a campaign in April that they called ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently"" to push the vigilante group out of their hometown. ""After we reached the solid conviction, without the shadow of a doubt, that (Raqqa) served as the stage of a horrific spectacle that deformed the real core of the Syrian revolution,"" the campaigns founding document reads, ""we decided it was about time we stood against those forces of evil."" ISIS reacted almost immediately to the campaign, sentencing the activists to death for ""non-belief in Islam and their advocacy of secularism,"" and offering a large cash prize for any information on their whereabouts, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""It is our obligation to confront them (ISIS) and if we remain scared of them then they will rule us forever. It is true this is dangerous and we have received more than one death threat, but we are relying on the popularity of our Facebook page as protection,"" Abu Ibrahim told CNN via a choppy Skype connection. On their Facebook page with nearly 12,000 followers, activists post updates on alleged crimes committed against the people of Raqqa and issue calls to action such as proposing a strike by store owners on Saturday to protest an ISIS tax hike. ""Life here is very hard. People are tired and they hate everything. If you don't close your shop during prayer time you get lashes, if you smoke you get lashed, if you say one wrong thing you can be executed. Just like that. It's that easy for ISIS,"" Abu Ibrahim says. The United Nations, the Syrian opposition and human rights groups have corroborated the scenes of horror in Raqqa. Earlier this year, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said reported mass executions in Raqqa may amount to war crimes, and in a separate report issued last month, her office documented torture and mistreatment, including repeated beatings, of prisoners at schools and hospitals controlled by ISIS. ""So many families have had people disappear and they have no idea where they are or what happened to them. The worst part is people are too afraid to ask about their husbands or sons,"" Abu Ibrahim says. After nearly every Friday prayer, a few of these prisoners appear in a public roundabout where dozens of onlookers stand by as charges are hurriedly read and the sentences against the accused carried out, ranging from lashes to executions. Images of the harrowing scenes often circulate on social-media sites, sometimes posted by accounts claiming to be linked to the extremist group. ""It is like a waterfall of blood. There are more and more executions and now the children watch like they are used to it. It is a strange and exciting scene and they are not afraid to look,"" Abu Ibrahim says. ISIS's military offensive against even its former allies and its savage form of justice led the central al Qaeda command to disown its affiliate earlier this year, but the group's leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, vowed to remain in Syria and fight all who oppose him, even fellow jihadists. The founders of the peaceful campaign ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently"" say they will succeed where others have failed. ""The word is often more powerful than the bullet, and the will of the people is the most powerful of all,"" Abu Ibrahim says. 25 children killed in elementary school bombing, Syrian activists say .","An eyewitness and his pictures document a Syrian scene meant to send a message .

"(CNN) -- ""Kazakhstan's political elites appear to enjoy typical hobbies -- such as travel, horseback riding and skiing. Not surprisingly, however, they are able to indulge their hobbies on a grand scale."" So begins a cable from a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan, written in 2008. What follows is an eye-opening tale of lavish living, including Elton John's performance at a birthday party for a seven-figure sum, a palace in the Emirates and prodigious drinking. Coming on the day U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrives in Kazakhstan for a conference, the timing of the leak could not have been more poignant. The cable begins with a visit by U.S. diplomats to President Nursultan Nazarbaev's horse farm, which has ""a large stable, indoor and outdoor riding arenas and a clubhouse"" as well as about 40 horses from various parts of the world. ""Nazarbaev is also fond of traveling to warmer climes,"" the cable continues, mentioning that he had traded local property for a ""palace"" in the United Arab Emirates. Quoting Turkish officials, the cable adds that the Kazakh president also had a mansion in Turkey. Other Kazakh officials also come under the spotlight, with a detailed account of Prime Minister Karim Masimov's visit to a nightclub called Chocolat in the capital, Astana. Apparently, the prime minister was quite the dancer: ""His companions quickly tired but Masimov remained, dancing alone and animatedly for another 15-20 minutes."" Later, the cable describes a dinner held for a visiting U.S. delegation by one of Kazakhstan's wealthiest men, Aleksandr Maskevich. ""It is not clear what Maskevich is spending his billions on,"" the cable continues, ""but it is certainly not culinary talent."" The menu featured boiled meat and noodles, and ""the wait staff appeared to be graduates of a Soviet cafeteria trading academy."" In a section entitled ""Private Concerts With The Stars,"" the cable describes the 2007 birthday celebrations of the president's son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev. Not only were Russia's biggest pop stars on hand, ""The headliner was Elton John, to whom he reportedly paid 1 million pounds ($1.55 million) for this one-time appearance."" CNN has reached out to John's representatives for comment. In the same year, singer Nelly Furtado was reportedly flown in to perform for Nazarbaev's daughter. It seems that being posted to Kazakhstan was rarely dull, as far as characters are concerned. The leaked cable ends with a florid description of then Defense Minister Daniyal Akhmetov, who ""appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true 'homo-sovieticus' style -- i.e. drinking oneself into a stupor."" It recounts a meeting between the minister and a senior U.S. Defense Department official in June 2007. ""Slouching in his chair and slurring all kinds of Russian participles, Akhmetov explained to this very senior guest that he had just been at a cadet graduation reception, 'toasting Kazakhstan's newly-commissioned officers.' "" Spotting the opportunity for a zinger, the cable's author observes: ""Who was toasted more -- the Defense Minister or the cadets -- is a matter of pure speculation.""","Dispatch from U.S. Embassy tells of free-flowing liquor, visits from stars .

"Washington (CNN) -- A group that protects the welfare of animals has released an undercover video it claims shows animal abuse at a Texas farm operated by the largest egg producer in the United States. The Humane Society of the United States says one of its investigators worked at the Cal-Maine farm in Waelder, Texas, for almost a month this fall and documented multiple abuses and food-safety violations. The video shows dead birds, birds stuck in their cages, overcrowding and what appears to be hens covered in feces. At one point the video shows a dead bird as eggs roll by just inches away on a conveyor belt. The short, edited video was shown at a news conference on Wednesday by the Humane Society's president and CEO, Wayne Pacelle. ""Our latest farm animal investigation documents inhumane treatment of laying hens and conditions that threaten food safety,"" Pacelle said from the group's headquarters in Washington. Pacell told reporters that Cal-Maine, based in Jackson, Mississippi, was unaware of the investigation and that the video was being made public for the first time. Pacell said he didn't know if the giant egg company had seen the video. Cal-Maine responded to the allegations with a statement on its website. ""Cal-Maine Foods has been a leader in accepting and implementing animal welfare measures. All of the Company's facilities are operated in full compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permits. Each employee involved in the care and handling of our hens is required to review, sign and comply with our Company code of conduct regarding the ethical treatment of hens which requires employees to report any possible violations,"" the statement said. The egg industry has taken a beating of late. Just this summer over half a billion eggs were recalled after a salmonella outbreak was traced to an Iowa farm. Cal-Maine is no stranger to recalls. It recalled 288,000 eggs earlier this month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration informed the company that eggs from one of its Ohio plants tested positive for Salmonella enteritidis. Salmonella, which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry, meat, eggs, or water, affects the intestinal tract. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces. Alternatively, bacteria in the hen's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it, FSIS said. Cal-Maine says it sold over 778 million eggs in 2009, which represents 18 percent of the United States market. According to the companies website,  ""Cal-Maine has an industry-leading record in food safety with all of its 35 processing plants independently verified as reaching the highest level of safety by the Safe Quality Food Institute."" Over 70 billion eggs are produced a year in the United States, and the Humane Society would like to see the large egg farms change their ways . ""Time and again, we've found that these massive facilities caging hundreds of thousands of animals do not properly care for the birds ... It's time for the egg industry to embrace cage-free housing systems and move away from battery cage confinement methods,"" Pacelle said. Battery cage systems allow many birds to be housed in one facility but critics claim it's dangerous and cruel to the animals. The Humane Society would like to see cage-free housing but so far only 5 percent of eggs produced in the U.S. use this method, according to Pacelle. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration implemented new rules in July for large egg producers. These mandates include cleaning poultry houses that test positive for salmonella, rodent control, refrigeration of eggs during storage and transportation and buying chicks and young hens only from suppliers who monitor for Salmonella bacteria. The USDA says that as many as 79,000 illnesses and 30 deaths due to consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella enteritidis may be avoided each year with these new measures in place.","The Humane Society releases a video it says shows animal abuse at an egg farm .

"London (CNN) -- Former London mayor Ken Livingstone paid tribute to his ""friend and comrade"" Hugo Chavez, calling him the first Venezuelan president to ""put his people before the interests of American oil companies."" Chavez, who died Tuesday, used some of Venezuela's vast oil wealth to bankroll huge social programs for the poor during his 14-year presidency. Critics, on the other hand, say much of the country's oil riches were squandered by a corrupt administration more focused on consolidating political power than lifting people out of poverty. Livingstone, nicknamed ""Red Ken"" for his socialist leanings, struck a controversial deal in 2007 with Chavez to fuel London's buses with discounted Venezuelan fuel, in exchange for advice on how to develop Venezuela's urban infrastructure. While Livingstone used the £14 million ($21m) fuel discount to subsidize buses for the poor in London, his critics say the deal exploited and further impoverished the poor people of Venezuela. His successor, Boris Johnson, promptly cancelled the deal upon taking office in 2008. Livingstone dismissed criticism of the deal, saying the advice he and his associates gave Venezuela would have cost ""hundreds of millions of pounds"" from the private sector, and insisting Chavez only ever had the interests of Venezuelans in mind. ""It's very few world leaders who remain unchanged,"" Livingstone told CNN. ""And it's hard to think of anyone who has been in power that long who's carried on looking after the ordinary population rather than enriching themselves."" The former mayor first met Chavez during the Venezuelan leader's 2006 visit to London and said Chavez's offer of discounted oil for advice was characteristic of a man who saw himself as more than just the president of Venezuela. He said: ""Chavez saw clearly that his job was to look out for the people of Venezuela, but he also saw that it was a global struggle between the great corporations and the vast mass of the people who get screwed by them."" Livingstone, who would end up travelling to Caracas in 2008 to deliver the advice he promised as part of the oil deal, was taken aback by the ""proper welfare state"" Chavez had created through his initiatives. ""I found it amazing the number of 40-year-olds wandering around with braces on their teeth, because there hadn't been a dentist when they were a kid,"" he said. ""There were little old ladies carrying around copies of the constitution which they could read, because [under Chavez] everyone got access to literacy programs."" Calling him a ""pleasure to be with,"" Livingstone said Chavez told him he never planned on being a politician - and that Chavez only became more radical following the failed 2002 coup attempt, which he blamed on the U.S. The coup fell apart within 48 hours and ""El Comandante,"" as he is affectionately known in Venezuela, was restored to office. Livingstone, who called Chavez a man with great tales, says the South American leader's ""best story"" was his version of events during the coup. Livingstone said Chavez told him that the generals who sprung the coup didn't want to kill the president themselves, so Chavez claimed three Americans whom he did not identify were flown in to kill him instead. ""Chavez told me that the three Americans were ushered into the room where a sergeant with a machine gun was guarding him. And the sergeant, who wasn't stupid, realized that after they killed Chavez they'd kill him as a witness. And so he turned his gun on the three men and said 'you leave the room or I'll kill you',"" Livingstone told CNN. A State Department official categorically denied Chavez's ""ridiculous"" claim and told CNN the U.S. had in fact alerted Chavez to a ""credible assassination plot"" on his life in the days before the coup. Souring U.S.-Venezuela relations reached their nadir when Chavez called George W. Bush ""the devil"" in a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly. WATCH: Chavez calls Bush ""the devil"" at U.N. ""Coming so close to death [in 2002] really pushed Chavez to the left,"" Livingstone said. ""If you think George W. Bush has authorized your assassination, you're not going to be very friendly about the U.S. after that.""","Livingstone calls Chavez's death a ""sad loss,"" calls him a ""friend and comrade""

"(CNN) -- Fast growing Abu Dhabi carrier Etihad is spreading its wings again by agreeing to a 49% stake in Italian loss-making airline Alitalia. The two parties put out a brief, joint statement which said they agreed to ""principal terms,"" although the financial details were not disclosed. When the Alitalia board gave a green light to the offer on June 15, Italy's Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi said that Etihad would make an upfront investment of $760 million and would commit to another $700 million by 2018. There are reports this could be even higher. This represents the biggest foreign stake of a European carrier, taking it to the 49% limit set by European Commission. Etihad becomes the biggest shareholder. Etihad is expected to cut up to 2,200 jobs as part of the agreement. The company also want to ensure Etihad will not carry an unfair burden of Alitalia's $1.3 billion in debt. Alitalia's unionized staff have resisted deep cuts over the past decade even though losses continued to mount for the flag carrier. The Italian government along with two major banks, Intesa Saopaolo and UniCredit, stepped in with a $680 million recapitalization in 2013. This reduced the stake of Air France-KLM, which had no desire to pump more money into the operation, to 7%. Italian officials have indicated that Alitalia is losing about $1.6 million a day, well over a half billion dollars a year. In April, Italy's Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan told me it was important for the government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to consummate this transaction as a signal the country is open for business. This deal represents the latest move by the Abu Dhabi carrier and its CEO James Hogan to build its network to more than 400 destinations. It has taken positions in seven carriers including Air Berlin, Air Serbia and Aer Lingus in Europe. It has also looked East, with stakes in stakes in Jet Airways of India and Virgin Australia. Etihad would not comment beyond its joint-statement, but Hogan spelled out his strategy during our interview at the Dubai Air Show last November. ""Having that network offering is key. But why do we all have to duplicate our overhead?"" Hogan said. He pointed to the need for ""centers of excellence"" with the ""lowest unit cost, whether it's reservations, whether it's part of training. Cost reduction is as important as exceeding customer expectation."" The challenge for Hogan is proving his team can turn around loss-makers like Air Berlin and Alitalia, while also picking up passengers for Etihad.

"(CNN) -- Incredible architecture and art are splendid and interesting enough but when I go to Italy, I want to eat. Which is why, after a dozen trips to the country, I decided to settle into the city of Bologna for a few weeks and consume as much as I possibly could. Now, every Italian will tell you that their region makes the best food. But for many, the best Italian food comes from the region of Emilia-Romagna, of which Bologna is the capital. Meat ragu, tortellini, lasagna, parmigiano cheese, mortadella, coppa and balsamic vinegar -- all have roots here and the resulting regional dishes are truly sublime. Through dozens of meals at dozens of restaurants, I compiled this one-day dining guide to the culinary and sensory overload that is Emilia-Romagna. The only two requirements? Bring extra cash and arrive hungry. Really hungry. Eat Like a Local: Share your favorite spots for superb regional eats . A light, social start . The Italian breakfast or colazione, is much lighter than the American version. It involves a simple coffee and a pastry, often filled with custard, cream or chocolate. My Italian friends, Odette and Mauro Messori, took me to their favorite breakfast stop one morning. For four years, every single day, the Messoris have walked 15 minutes downtown to the Fashion CafÃ© (Via Massimo D'azeglio 34). This modern and unusual version of the typical Italian coffee shop is situated inside a bookstore. Mauro peruses books and orders his daily macchiato while Odette prefers a frothy and creamy cappuccino estivo. ""Le gente,"" or the people, however, are what Mauro loves most about his breakfast stop. In Italy, breakfast is more a social event than anything else, where you catch up with friends and start the day with hugs, handshakes and small talk. Pastry and coffee is more of an afterthought, but a really tasty one. I also stumbled upon a wonderful coffee bar during my stay, called Le Petit CafÃ© (Strada Maggiore 25), just a few minutes walk east of downtown. The coffee is excellent and prepared with great care, made better with a slice of fresh bread topped with a dollop of locally made marmellata. Delizioso. The real eating begins . Lunch in Italy was once regarded as the most important meal of the day. Now, as the cities and towns modernize and more of the younger people are working in offices rather than the fields, lunchtime has become less complex and time consuming. Unless of course, you're a tourist like myself and want to eat till your belly extends and your breath shortens. If that's the case, many restaurants still oblige. One such restaurant is All'Osteria Bottega (Via Santa Caterina 54), about a 20-minute walk from downtown on a quiet unassuming street. Plan to take your time here and arrive ravenous. My friend Vanessa and I ordered a regional white wine and enthusiastically awaited our antipasti: homemade pickled vegetables in olive oil which were perfectly balanced and not too acidic. Next arrived the famous Culatello di Zibello or regional Parma ham aged for one year along the Po River -- an area whose winter fogs and humid summers make the air unlike any other in the world, plus the local Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, aged 30 months. To taste the finest parmigiano cheese is not understood until tried, savored. Vanessa's stuffed zucchini with meatballs evoked memories of how her own Italian grandmother used to cook, while my freshly made rigatoni with a white ragout of small sausage meatballs, cannellini beans and rosemary was by far the most memorable pasta experience I had in Emilia-Romagna. You just can't believe food can taste this good. (Delicious local dishes tortellini in brodo and tagliatelli al ragu are also on the menu here.) Satiated, we passed on a second course in exchange for the hot chocolate cake with red currants. One fork piercing elicited a liquid chocolate so good I couldn't speak. I just about licked my plate clean, like any good Italian. An irresistible snack . Get up slowly. With a satisfied lethargy, walk along the pretty porticoes that are the backbone to this cosmopolitan city. After 30 minutes or so, I like to think you've walked long enough to deserve a gelato. Dating back to the 16th century in Italy, gelato is made primarily with milk rather than cream, giving it a lower milk-fat content than ice cream. It's denser than American ice cream with less air whipped into it, which intensifies the flavors. Stefino Bio is an innovative gelato shop, situated on Via Petroni close to the University, that uses all organic ingredients. Their specialties include chocolate and pistachio-based flavors. Try the wasabi gelato or chocolate with ginger. To eat more at this point seems almost inconceivable, but it's amazing what a late day leisurely stroll and an espresso can do. You sit down to rest in a pretty piazza, the stomach growls slightly and your next thought appears with an anxious, slow smile, ""Time for dinner!"" One more delicious meal . ""To give is to receive,"" is the mantra followed by the owner of Ristorante da Fabio, a cozy family-run restaurant that's located in the Castiglione area. Gluttons find true bliss here as dishes are brought out in succession, delivered in big, family style bowls. If any meal felt like an Italian feast, it was this dinner. Mozzarella di bufala, ricotta cheese, crusted bread, liver pate, baked tomatoes with cheesy breadcrumbs, celery salad, grilled eggplant, braised endive, roasted zucchini, mortadella, prosciutto ... Yes, we ate all of that, and that was just the antipasti. Great Italian food forces you to stop and take your time. We savored every bite, paused for audible and elongated 'mmmms,' and pressed on with mushroom risotto and fettuccine with pumpkin and pancetta. Both dishes reminded me that if you take deep breaths, you might make room for a little more. We drank, ate, drank, ate and finished our plates. Breathe ... In Bologna, you can get around quite well with English. But it is wise to learn a few words and phrases, like ""Basta"" (stop) ""Sono piena"" (I am full) or ""No ce la faccio piu"" (I can't take anymore). Feast in all these restaurants in just one day and you'll be repeating every one of these phrases. But the peculiar thing is, you'll head home, have a good slumber, wake up and want to do it all over again. Pasticcini anyone? Follow CNN Travel on Twitter @CNNTravel .

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder says the Justice Department plans to expand a review of police tactics to update training, technology and other standards around the nation. The aim, in part, is to produce broad national recommendations to enhance officers' safety, help them deal with new threats and also boost the use of technology such as police car and body cameras. In the wake of complaints about police handling of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, critics likely will also push for new standards to address police crowd control tactics and the use of force. The protests followed the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer in August. Associations representing police officers and executives have supported the idea of a commission to review standards. Holder, who speaks to a gathering of police officers in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Wednesday, plans to announce his support for such a commission to do the most expansive review of police tactics in 50 years. Holder on Supreme Court's Ohio early voting decision: A 'step backward' Holder, in prepared remarks, said the goal of the ongoing review is to ""swiftly confront emerging threats, better address persistent challenges, and thoroughly examine the latest tools and technologies to enhance the safety, and the effectiveness, of law enforcement."" An ongoing review is already doing some of the work. But Holder says expanding it would ""consider the profession in a comprehensive way and to provide strong, national direction on a scale not seen since President Lyndon Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement nearly half a century ago."" Excerpts of his speech were provided by the Justice Department before delivery. Holder's speech is also intended to mark the 20th anniversary of a landmark crime law that created the federal COPS grants program, which funds community policing in cities around the country.","Goal is to produce recommendations to help police deal with new threats .

He's talking about a unit of the military made up entirely of the foreign-born -- including illegal immigrants -- where the compensation would include U.S. citizenship. About 70,000 foreign-born men and women serve in the U.S. armed forces, or about 5 percent of the total active-duty force, according to the Pentagon. Of those, nearly 30,000 -- or about 43 percent -- are not U.S. citizens. Roping illegal immigrants into military service could accomplish two goals at once: helping alleviate the military's recruitment worries while giving the undocumented a chance to prove that their commitment to this country extends beyond a paycheck. We're already talking about requiring illegal immigrants to learn English, pay fines, and return to their home countries to earn legal status. Why not, some say, raise the stakes and require men and women between 18 and 42 to serve a couple of years in the military to earn something even more precious: U.S. citizenship for themselves and their children? The idea appealed to a reader in upstate New York who called me to gauge my reaction. I told him that I hadn't made up my mind, but that the concept did fit with my view that any conferring of legal status be laden with onerous conditions so that it really is earned. To earn it, illegal immigrants should have to do everything but walk across broken glass. Still, I told him, I'm not sure how those who oppose comprehensive reform but support turning illegal immigrants into cannon fodder go about squaring that circle. Restrictionists and racists have argued that illegal immigrants are invading this country, and that they're a dangerous menace to society that is prone to all sorts of violent and criminal behavior. Of course, many native-born U.S. citizens are just as menacing. But for those who believe that illegal immigrants are inherently violent, do they really want to give these folks military training and a M-16, to help them graduate from menacing to lethal? After all, assuming they survive their stint in the military, they eventually have to return stateside. Then they're our problem. Consider the ghastly events in Newark, New Jersey, where three African-American students were killed execution-style and a fourth was shot in the head but survived. The accused ringleader is Jose Carranza, an illegal immigrant from Peru, who was previously charged with raping a 5-year-old girl and threatening her parents. Twice indicted by grand juries, Carranza slipped through the cracks and was released on bail. Authorities say that the 28-year-old construction worker led at least four other individuals in attacking the youths with a gun and a machete. If convicted, Carranza could get the death penalty. Glad to hear it. If half the things they say about this creep are true, Carranza belongs on death row. But guess what? He sure doesn't belong on an Army recruitment poster, or handling heavy artillery.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- During the current economic crisis, high-flying women have been overlooked for promotion, according to a study out Tuesday. At the upper level of management, business is still dominated by men. The study, by U.S. nonprofit research group Catalyst, surveyed 873 MBA alumni who graduated between 1996 and 2007, asking how their careers had fared between November 2007 and June 2009. The results showed that overall, male and female MBAs have proved resilient to the recession and have fared equally well in the U.S., Canada and Asia, with 31 percent of surveyed women reporting that they had been promoted during that time period, compared to 36 percent of men. However in Europe, just 26 per cent of women were promoted, compared with 44 percent of men, according to the study published in the Harvard Business Review. According to the Harvard Business Review, of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies only two per cent of the CEOs are women, and only 15 per cent of the seats on their boards of directors are held by women. Professor Susan Vinnicombe is the director of the Center for International Women Business Leaders at Cranfield University School of Management in England. She told CNN that while it isn't clear why the figures for Europe in particular show such a gender discrepancy, it reflects discrimination faced by women business leaders in general. Read more business related features . ""There is a whole stream of research of male and female MBAs that systematically shows the more senior they get the bigger the disparities in salaries and promotion,"" she said. ""Immediately after the MBA -- at the mid level -- women do quite well, but as they progress upwards the disparities emerge and get wider. That's not just for MBAs, it's the function of men and women in the workforce in general."" When it comes to the top tier, women worldwide were much more likely than men to lose their jobs, with 19 percent of female senior executives losing their jobs, compared with six per cent of men. Eleanor Tabi Haller-Jorden, General Manager of Catalyst Europe told CNN that the discrepancy is probably not the result of the current economic malaise. ""These figures reflect what has been a challenge in Europe for a number years,"" she said. ""The talent pipeline in Europe is clearly not as robust for women. This study indicates that by and large this is not directly related to the economic crisis, but it may have magnified the discrepancy."" Haller-Jorden cites European corporate culture, perpetuation of gender-based stereotypes, exclusion of women from informal networks and a lack of role models as reasons behind the discrepancy. Cranfield University produces what it calls the ""Female FTSE Index,"" showing the percentage of female directors in Britain's top 100 companies. Vinnicombe says that in the last 10 years the number of female directors has hardly improved, increasing from seven per cent to just 11 percent. Vinnicombe adds that she has found anecdotal evidence that a number of senior women in the British banking sector have chosen to leave their jobs, rather than work in a ""high pressure, highly controlling"" work environment brought about by the economic crisis. The Catalyst study also shows that many MBAs aren't letting the economic crisis get in the way of career advancement. Overall, 34 percent of respondents had received a promotion and 35 percent made a lateral move. ""The data almost indicates business as usual, in highly unusual times for business,"" Haller-Jorden told CNN. The common perception might be that given the current economic uncertainty, employees would choose to play it safe rather than chance their luck in a volatile job market, but the study found that MBAs have been willing to risk career moves, with 20 percent of respondents changing jobs, 14 percent relocating and four percent starting their own business. Haller-Jorden said that MBAs represent ""high-potential employees"" who tend to be entrepreneurial and show a high level of initiative. She added that these individuals tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their careers, seeking out new developmental opportunities, exploring lateral moves, looking at options around relocating, and choosing other employment opportunities to make sure they aren't negatively impacted by recession. ""The results are sobering for a corporate sector which may have assumed that people would be grateful to have a job and wouldn't necessarily be exploring other options,"" she said. ""For companies to rest on their laurels and assume they don't need to worry about retention is a mistake.""","Study: High-flying women are missing out on promotion .

"Washington (CNN) -- With less than a month until Election Day, Sen. Mary Landrieu is changing her reelection campaign's leadership. The Louisiana Democrat shook up her campaign staff, bringing in a new campaign manager and calling up former and current Senate staffers to help her beat back challenges from two Republicans in the state's jungle primary-style election, the New Orleans Times-Picayune first reported Wednesday. The changes come as Landrieu faces slimming odds that she will win 50% of votes to avoid a runoff election. Ryan Berni, who ran her brother New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's reelection campaign earlier this year, is now leading the reelection bid, and Landrieu also rang her former chief of staff Norma Jane Sabiston to advise the campaign. Current campaign manager Adam Sullivan will stay on as a senior adviser to the campaign. Landrieu campaign spokesman Fabien Levy would not say why specifically Sullivan was replaced. ""As Senator Landrieu has done in all of her races, she is bringing on some of her long-time and trusted advisers to assist during the last month of the race to lead us to victory on November 4.,"" Landrieu campaign spokesman Fabien Levy told CNN in an email. Senator reimburses federal government more than $30,000 in travel . Two Landrieu Senate staffers, her state director and Washington communications director, are also taking leaves of absence to bolster their boss's campaign. Landrieu has faced an uphill climb in her reelection bid this year and the challenge for her new staff will be to help Landrieu crack the 50% threshold needed to avoid a December runoff. That seems unlikely according to the latest CNN/ORC poll, that showed her support stood at 43%, with Rep. Bill Cassidy coming in a close second with 40%. A runoff election between the two could favor Cassidy, who would be able to regain votes lost to the third candidate, tea party Republican Rob Maness. That election would be close though, with the CNN/ORC poll giving Cassidy just a 3-point lead in an eventual runoff with the incumbent Senator.

"(CNN) -- â€ªIndia: you either love it or hate it. Or one day you wake up and realize where you fit into India and where India fits into you. The country of 1.2 billion draws more than 7 million tourists a year, but there's far more to gain than spiritual enlightenment and an expanded waistline. Home to 28 states and 7 union territories, India contains more than 800 dialects and can lay claim to some of the most varied sites in the world. From Kerala's backwaters to Tamil Nadu's temples, and Rajasthan's deserts to Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world, there are endless superlatives to go around. Here are 10. More: 10 things Italy does better than anywhere else . 1. Barbers . In India, a simple hair cut is anything but. Barbers will take their scissors to wayward eyebrows, tufts of ear hair and nostrils. That's just the beginning. Once the customer is shorn, wet-wiped and toweled off, barbers begin a firm head, neck and shoulder massage, which can descend into facial slapping and skull-pounding known as ""champi,"" which is where the word ""shampoo"" comes from. Be warned: their signature move is a swift neck crack, which can come as a shock to first-timers. More: Insider Guide: Best of Mumbai . 2. Enterprising street vendors . India's street vendors sell the usual wares, from fake DVDs to earrings to bags of masala popcorn and roasted peanuts. But there's also ear-cleaning, street dentistry and pavement astrology.

This year marks 160 years since the birth of Indian Railways, which carries more than 20 million passengers a day along 65,000 kilometers of track. Thundering through cities, inching past villages, snaking along coastlines and climbing mountains, the network of toy trains, luxury trains, Shatabdi speed trains and commuter trains is lovingly known as ""the lifeline of a nation."" In terms of safety, however, there's still far to go, owing to the trains' decrepit state, unmanned crossings and lack of government attention.

Hollywood stars have nothing on Bollywood stars when it comes to entourages, paparazzi and fanatic followings. They might endorse skin-lightening creams, produce terrible films and become embroiled in one scandal after another, but almost nothing can't dim their stardom. Current fave Sunny Leone -- a former pediatric nurse trainee in Orange Country turned porn star and now mainstream actress -- is the most searched celebrity on the Internet, racking up 35 million searches in India this year. 5. Accessorizing . From Hyderabad pearls to Jaipuri gems, intricate Indian jewelry is coveted the world over, and local women are usually dripping in it. In the markets in Rajasthan, maids sweep temples and Rabari tribeswomen in Gujarat effortlessly carry buckets, mop floors and balance heavy loads -- all while wearing five-inch diameter nose rings, toe-rings, glass bangles to the elbow and gold necklaces swinging by their bellies.

From Mumbai's Mohammed Ali Road for kebabs to Amritsar's Lawrence Road for Makhan Fish, India's addictive food leaves no room for worries over waistlines. Steaming chicken kathi rolls, crunchy sweet and sour bhel puri or creamy lassi from even the starkest of roadside shacks are bewilderingly tasty and satisfying. 7. Gesticulating . India has more than 800 dialects, but it's the head-shaking and wrist-flicking gestures that are the most dramatic means of communication and an inherent part of an Indian's genetic makeup. In South India, pointing a thumb toward the mouth can mean anything from ""what do you want?"" to ""have you eaten?"" To make matters more confusing, Indians will often shake their heads from right to left to signify that they are, in fact, following what you're saying and agreeing, rather than disagreeing. 8. Obsessing over cricket . When the British left India, they left two real legacies: the railways and cricket. Not just the preserve of the upper classes wearing club ties, drinking Pimms and eating cucumber sandwiches, cricket in India is a way of life, enjoyed by every class, age and sex, while cricketers are revered as gods. Watching a live Indian Premier League match is a nighttime floodlit spectacle featuring semi-clad cheerleaders, fog horns, fireworks in the crowds, drummers and, of course, with a brand value of just less than $3 billion, a lot of extravagantly rich cricket players. More: 9 of the world's most heated rivalries (including India vs. Pakistan cricket) 9. Festivals . With so many religions and cultures existing side by side in India, it's rare for a week to go by without some sort of celebration. Indians will normally extend invitations to anyone and everyone from next door neighbors to stray travelers who they may have met that morning on a train. It's wise to bring along a change of clothes when invited to share mutton biryani during Eid or set off Lakshmi banger fireworks in the street at Diwali or be doused in colored water during Holi, the festival of spring.

Less well known than other hill stations, Matheran is one of many we love. Hidden between the jungle-topped Sahyadri hills 80 kilometers east of Mumbai, it was originally used by the British to escape the Bombay heat, and is free from fume-spewing vehicles while being accessible on horseback, on foot or by the narrow-gauge toy train that trundles along tiny tracks.

"(CNN) -- People arrested amid unrest in Syria are being subjected to systematic torture, including electric shocks, beatings and sexual violence, a report by rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday. Based on interviews in Jordan with dozens of Syrians who have fled the country, the report details ""31 methods of torture or other ill treatment"" at the hands of the security forces, army and pro-government armed gangs. This Thursday marks a year since unrest first broke out, prompting a bloody crackdown and massive wave of arrests by the Syrian authorities. The government says it is battling ""armed terrorist groups"" but international leaders and rights groups dispute that. The torture meted out to those arrested on suspicion of opposing the government has generally followed a set pattern, says the Amnesty International report, titled ""'I wanted to die': Syria's torture survivors speak out."" Many detainees say they were beaten on arrest, and then subjected to severe beatings on arrival at detention centers. But their accounts show the greatest risk of abuse came when they were interrogated, the report says. Several detainees describe being forced into a vehicle tire and then beaten with cables or sticks, the report says. Others tell of being suspended above the ground by their wrists and then beaten, and of being forced to strip naked, often for long periods in extreme cold. An 18-year-old victim named as ""Karim"" told researchers that his interrogators used pincers to gouge flesh from his legs while he was held for 25 days in Daraa in December. Another man, a 29-year-old Arabic language teacher identified as ""Musleh,"" also described horrific treatment while being held in Daraa. ""We were hung from wood -- crucified -- while blindfolded and handcuffed, and then beaten mercilessly and repeatedly between 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.,"" he told the Amnesty researchers. Detainees also were forced to witness abuse and hear others -- sometimes relatives or friends -- being tortured and raped, the report says. ""I heard the screams of those being tortured for 24 hours a day. While in the cell we were busy praying for the safety of those who are being tortured,"" Musleh is quoted as saying. The accounts reveal ""a nightmarish world of systematic torture,"" said Ann Harrison, interim deputy director for Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. ""The testimonies we have heard give disturbing insights into a system of detention and interrogation which, a year after protests began, appears intended primarily to degrade, humiliate and terrify its victims into silence,"" she said. She said the experience for detainees arrested over the past year is similar to that endured under former President Hafez Assad, father of the current leader, Bashar al-Assad. Researchers spoke with dozens of Syrians in Jordan, including 25 who said they were tortured or ill-treated in detention before fleeing the country, an Amnesty press statement says. More than half the 19 cases featured in the report are from Daraa province, it adds. The abuses are being routinely carried out despite Syria being a party to the Convention against Torture and other international agreements, the report says, and the Syrian authorities ""appear to have no desire to try to stamp out these grave human rights violations."" The rights group urges Syria to take ""urgent measures"" to prevent further crimes under international law, including ending the arbitrary arrest and detention of those protesting peacefully against the government and halting the systemic use of torture. It also calls on the international community to take on responsibility for protecting the human rights of the Syrian people and ensuring violations are investigated and prosecuted. International leaders should also assist humanitarian agencies, rights groups and non-governmental organizations in helping the survivors of torture and their families, particularly in cases of sexual violence. Lastly, the report urges the U.N. Security Council to act by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court for investigation, imposing a comprehensive arms embargo and freezing the assets of al-Assad and his associates. Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution last month that many other countries argued could have helped stop the violence. The resolution would have condemned al-Assad and called on him to step aside. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, including many women and children, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, current president of the U.N. General Assembly, said Tuesday. Opposition activists have put the toll at more than 9,000. About 30,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries in the past year, according to Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' coordinator for Syrian refugees. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. Members of the Syrian security forces are also among those killed as the initially peaceful protests have spiraled into widespread violence. CNN's Bruce Conover contributed to this report.","Syrian survivors describe brutal treatment by security forces, Amnesty International says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Clashes between Hamas militants and Israeli soldiers raged to the north and east of densely populated Gaza City early Sunday, the 16th day of an Israeli offensive, witnesses and medical sources said. A photo provided by the Israel Defense Forces shows troops in Gaza on Saturday. Heavy gunfire could be heard to the east of Gaza City -- home to about 400,000 of Gaza's 1.5 million people -- as fighting moved closer, according to a CNN stringer in the area. Israeli shelling north of the city killed two people, sources at Shifa hospital told CNN. Sunday's fighting came after one girl was killed and 49 other people were severely burned by fires caused by Israeli shelling in southern Gaza on Saturday, local hospital sources said. The shelling ignited several buildings, including a U.N. school, near the city of Khan Younes, sources said. The girl died of burns she suffered in one of the fires, the sources said. Also Saturday, a family of nine was killed when a shell hit their home in the village of Jebalya in northern Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. The Israeli military was ""not operating in the area of this house, and no fire was directed in that direction,"" a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said. Later Saturday, the IDF said that two rocket-launching squads near Jebalya were hit. Meanwhile, Hamas militants fired 20 Grad long-range rockets into Israel on Saturday, injuring four civilians, according to an IDF spokesman. And the Hamas commander in charge of launching rockets into Israel from the Gaza City area was killed Saturday by Israeli ground fire, the IDF said. Amir Mansi was spotted firing a rocket Saturday from the Jabel Rise area, east of Gaza City, during a ground force operation, the IDF said. Israeli forces opened fire, killing Mansi and wounding two other Hamas operatives, who were captured, the Israelis said.  Watch what overnight air attacks did » . Mansi was the leading Hamas authority on the Grad long-range missile-launching system, the IDF said. Grad rockets have allowed Hamas to reach farther into Israel than in previous attacks. Israelis say their Gaza military operation, which started December 27, is aimed at stopping Hamas militants from sending rockets into southern Israel. The operation began with airstrikes; a week later, the Israeli military launched a ground assault. More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in the attacks, including 235 children, and about 3,300 people have been wounded, according to Palestinian medical sources. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died since the operation began.   See images from the offensive » . On Saturday evening, two pair of Israeli F-16 fighter jets that were on bombing runs in southern Gaza violated Egyptian airspace, a CNN team observed. ""We can tell they're coming through Egyptian airspace because they're over the far side of the building where we're standing,"" CNN's Karl Penhaul reported from Rafah, Egypt. He was atop a building about 500 meters (547 yards) from the Gaza border. The Israelis have been bombing tunnels that run under the border of southern Gaza and Egypt. Israel says Hamas smuggles weapons and munitions through them into Gaza. A spokesman for the Egyptian prime minister's office said the Israeli aircraft did not have permission to use the airspace. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said no airspace violation had occurred. Before strafing the area in and around Rafah, the Israeli air force dropped leaflets warning residents to leave their homes because more Israeli attacks were imminent, Palestinian security sources said. According to an IDF spokesman, the leaflets say: ""Two days ago, the IDF distributed leaflets in Rafah in which the residents were warned to evacuate their homes for their own safety. As they heeded the IDF instructions, the harming of residents in combat was avoided. ""Over the coming period, the IDF will continue to target tunnels, weapon caches and terrorist operatives with growing intensity. For your safety and that of your family, stay away from terrorist elements or places where weapons are stored or places where terrorist elements operate."" In Gaza City on Saturday afternoon, heavy black smoke rose during a three-hour period during which Israel was to halt its attacks on militants so Palestinians could stock up on supplies. CNN's Ben Wedeman said the lulls, which have been tried before, aren't ""rock solid."" Limited military activity continues during that period, he said. A United Nations spokesman said Saturday's pause was not long enough to resume the transport of humanitarian supplies from Israel into Gaza. iReport.com: Share thoughts, reactions to crisis in the Middle East . Meanwhile, in Cairo, Egypt, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to discuss a possible cease-fire. Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal said during a televised news conference Saturday night that his followers will consider any proposals to stop the violence if conditions are met: the Israelis stop their ""aggression"" and all crossings between Israel and Gaza are opened.

"A central California man has been arrested for possession of child pornography, thanks to a tip from burglars who robbed the man's property, authorities said. Last month, a juvenile and a 19-year-old illegally accessed the property of Kraig Stockard, 54, of Delhi, California, according to a statement from Deputy Tom MacKenzie of the Merced County Sheriff's Department.  They broke into Stockard's barn and stole about 50 CDs they believed were blank. Stockard filed a police report on the incident on September 12, according to MacKenzie. But the young people who stole the CDs were in for a surprise. When they began putting the discs into their computer, they discovered that some of them contained pornographic images of children, the statement said. Despite having obtained the CDs under decidedly shady circumstances, the pair decided to report Stockard to the police. A search warrant was served and three more computers and three laptops were taken from Stockard's home, along with several external hard drives. Police said there were thousands of pictures and movies on the CDs -- more than 30 of the 50 discs had child pornography on them. Investigators said Stockard has been downloading indecent images of children since 2004.  He has admitted possessing the pornography on the CDs but has refused to say whether there is pornography on the computers, they said. Stockard was booked for possession of child pornography and posted $25,000 bail. The two burglar suspects who reported Stockard have not been arrested. Their case has been sent to the Merced County District Attorney's Office for review.  When reached for comment, a press officer told CNN the office could not comment on the case because one of the  informants in question is a juvenile.","Police arrest a man on child pornography charges after a tip from two burglary suspects .

"Washington (CNN) -- Finding al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and rolling back a resurgent Taliban are necessary steps toward winning the war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. commander there told a Senate committee Tuesday. Bin Laden remains at large more than eight years after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington that triggered the Afghan war, and is widely believed to be hiding along the rugged border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said the world's most wanted terrorist is ""an iconic figure"" whose survival ""emboldens al Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world."" ""It would not defeat al Qaeda to have him captured or killed, but I don't think we can finally defeat al Qaeda until he is finally captured or killed,"" McChrystal told the Senate Armed Services Committee. But he said if bin Laden is hiding across the border, ""It is outside of my mandate."" In addition, he said, pushing back the Taliban -- which allowed al Qaeda to operate from Afghanistan before 9/11 -- is a ""prerequisite"" for destroying the terrorist network. ""To pursue our core goal of defeating al Qaeda and preventing their return to Afghanistan, we must disrupt and degrade the Taliban's capacity, deny their access to the Afghan population, and strengthen the Afghan security forces,"" he said. McChrystal's appearance before senators was his second round of testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, following a session with the House Armed Services Committee earlier in the day. Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, joined him in both hearings. Both men were called to testify about President Obama's new plan for the Afghan war, which involves the deployment of another 30,000 U.S. troops and a July 2011 date for the beginning of an American withdrawal. McChrystal said the next 18 months will be ""critical"" to the war effort and said U.S. forces must convince Afghans that ""we are going to win."" The United States and its NATO allies must reverse the Taliban's actual and perceived momentum and establish ""contiguous security"" around the country rather than the pockets that currently exist, McChrystal said. One advantage U.S. troops have is that the Taliban -- which ruled most of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks -- remain largely unpopular among Afghans and draw support only through the threat of violence. ""I have never seen evidence that the Taliban have popular support like a political liberation movement,"" he said. In August, the general had cautioned that a failure to reverse Taliban gains within 12 months could make defeating the insurgents impossible. But his testimony Tuesday lengthened that timeline. ""The sober fact is that there are no silver bullets,"" he told the House committee. ""Ultimate success will be the cumulative effect of sustained pressure."" McChrystal said he ""participated fully in the president's assessment and decision-making process"" and fully supports Obama's decision. And Eikenberry, whose leaked cables to Washington indicated that he opposed sending large numbers of troops to the conflict, told the Senate he is ""100 percent"" behind the new strategy ""with the refinement of the mission."" His initial questions, Eikenberry told the House, were about the number of troops, the timeline for those troops, and the context in which those troops would operate. ""The mission was refined, the ways forward were clarified, and the resources now have been committed to allow us to achieve the refined mission,"" said the ambassador, a retired general who held a senior post in Kabul before retiring from the Army. ""With that, at this point in time ... I am unequivocally in support of this mission and I am exactly aligned with Gen. McChrystal in moving forward now to vigorously implement the assigned mission."" Both Eikenberry and McChrystal went out of their way to minimize the differences in their views after reports of an Eikenberry cable advising the president that McChrystal's plans to send more troops would be ill advised because of a lack of confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In their opening statements, both said they were honored to testify together and each called the other a friend. But more of those differences were seen when the men gave their predictions about the final outcome of the war. ""I believe we will absolutely be successful,"" McChrystal responded when the committee chairman, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, asked the general point-blank about the chances for success of the U.S. mission. Earlier, in his opening remarks, the general had said, ""The mission is not only important, it is also achievable. We can and will accomplish this mission."" Eikenberry was more cautious, saying that ""success is not guaranteed but it is possible."" But McChrystal emphasized that the July 2011 date is only a marker in the broader picture, and not a ""major factor"" in U.S. military strategy. ""I don't view July 2011 as a deadline. I don't believe it is a deadline at all,"" he told lawmakers, later adding that he assumed a U.S. troop withdrawal will begin at that time. ""It is a solid decision the president has made and I operate under the assumption that we will begin to decrease our forces beginning in July 2011,"" the general said. McChrystal said that the influx of additional troops should bring ""significant progress"" in the war by next summer, and by next December he should be able to ""lay out progress"" and show evidence of success in a report he will present. ""My expectation is the insurgency will be less robust in the summer of 2011, significantly so, and it is also my expectation that the Afghan security forces will be more robust,"" McChrystal said. ""I see confidently in the summer of 2011 that beginning the reduction of forces will be appropriate, the pace and scope of which needs to be conditions-based on how strong is insurgency at that point."" He said the Taliban must not become ""an existential threat"" to the Afghan government, ""and thus to the Afghan people."" ""So rather than wipe out every Taliban member, what we need to do is lower their capacity to the point where -- within their own means -- Afghanistan can hold them from being a major threat to either their way of life or their government. ""I think that, over time, that will cause the Taliban to go away, to become irrelevant, and cease to exist,"" he explained. At present, 68,000 U.S. troops are operating under both NATO and U.S. commands in Afghanistan, and around 42,000 non-U.S. forces are under NATO. The Pentagon announced 1,500 more Marines would be deploying this month as part of the new strategy. Last week, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Britain, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and non-NATO member Georgia are among at least 25 countries offering to send a total of 7,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Four men were convicted in Germany on Thursday in connection with a foiled terrorist plot against Western targets, court officials said. The men had begun mixing a huge amount of explosive material that could have resulted in a strong blast, bigger than attacks in 2005 on London's public transport network and the 2004 Madrid railway bombings, authorities said. Three of the men -- two Germans and a Turk -- were arrested in September 2007. The other was arrested later. The Germans -- Fritz Gelowicz and Daniel Schneider -- were sentenced to 12 years in prison. Turkish citizen Adem Yilmaz received 11 years. Attila Selek, a German citizen of Turkish descent, received five years. Gelowicz, Schneider and Yilmaz were convicted of, among other things, being members of a terrorist organization, court officials said. The men had joined the Islamic Jihad Union in 2006. Selek received a shorter sentence because he was convicted only of supporting the organization. Three of the men had trained at camps in northern Pakistan with the group that had ties to al Qaeda, German authorities said. The group said it wanted to target the Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, German authorities said. The group also wanted to force Germany to stop using an air base in Uzbekistan as a stopover point for moving equipment and personnel in and out of northern Afghanistan. -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Authorities say planned blast would have eclipsed London and Madrid bombings .

"(CNN) -- Militants with the Islamist group al-Shabaab stormed Somalia's presidential palace in Mogadishu on Tuesday, firing their way onto the grounds after a car bomb blasted the gate, authorities said. Somali and African Union troops exchanged heavy gunfire with the militants and thwarted the attack, a senior Somali security official said. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was not harmed and Somalia's government praised the troops. ""Fortunately, the prompt actions of the Somali National Army, assisted by AMISOM forces (African Union Mission in Somalia), quickly halted the attack,"" said government spokesman Mustafa Duhulow. Three attackers were killed and one was captured, he said. ""Bomb disposal personnel have rendered safe a number of devices, including a suicide vest that one attacker was wearing that had failed to detonate,"" Dhulow said. Al-Shabaab said it was behind the raid, one of several recent Mogadishu attacks for which the al Qaeda-linked group has claimed responsibility as it presses its campaign to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. Earlier, al-Shabaab spokesman Abdulaziz Abu Musab claimed the group's militants had captured the offices of the President and the prime minister. ""Terrorists can make as many claims and threats on the internet as they want,"" Mohamud said from his office. ""The attack failed."" U.S. condemns attack . The U.S. State Department issued a statement condemning the attack and praising AMISOM troops, which get U.S. support. ""Incidents such as this further demonstrate that insecurity in Mogadishu persists, including very real threats from al-Shabaab,"" the statement said. The incident comes after several high-profile attacks in the capital, including a car bombing -- claimed by al-Shabaab -- that killed at least six people at the Parliament building on Saturday. On Thursday, gunmen killed one Somali lawmaker and wounded another in a drive-by shooting in Mogadishu, the third assassination of a Parliament member claimed by al-Shabaab this year. Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. The two groups effectively merged in 2012, according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. The group aims to establish Islamic rule in Somalia, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well. It allegedly carried out a mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September that left at 67 people dead.

"State House Entebbe ebbed and flowed with dramatic contrasts: laughter at sexual jokes versus the pain of impending persecution and prosecution; Western freedoms clashing with African culture; an unwinnable battle between science and learned behavior; nature and nurture. Who decides? President Yoweri Museveni did, in this moment, inking into law harsh penalties for gay people, supported overwhelmingly by Ugandans. I was floored at the barrage of criticism belted out to The West. ""Arrogant western groups are to blame."" Applause. ""Leave us alone."" Applause. ""We don't need your (donor) money."" Huge applause. The press conference was attended by MPs, scientists, Ugandan officials and other journalists. I stepped out for a moment to do a report by telephone, which we call a beeper at CNN, and returned to a room that was pretty jovial. It felt uncomfortable to laugh about something that had such serious implications. ""What did I miss?"" I asked my producer Antonia. ""Something about the mouth being for kissing and eating only, and not for going south, only north,"" comments delivered by the president to more laughter, she said. I approached the mic and asked two questions that were significantly less amusing -- there was palpable tension in the room as a blanket of silence descended. I was in the minority, raising subjects like human rights and freedom of speech, and asking if he wasn't taking Uganda a step backwards in time? The response tore into Western values and ripped to shreds any willingness to tolerate Western ideas around sexuality or ""social imperialism,"" as the president put it. Now it's easy to roll your eyes but I know this region, and many Africans think the imposition of social norms by the U.S. or Western and former colonial powers is offensive and unwanted, though they love Western music, movies and cutting-edge technologies. Overall, East Africans are not generally anti-Western. I was shocked when Museveni declared, to even more clapping, that Uganda doesn't need aid money from the West. I turned to Antonia: ""Did he really just say that?"" She nodded and folded up the note we wrote to an aide requesting an exclusive interview with the president. Newsflash to me: I realized then that Uganda clearly didn't feel dependent on Western aid money. Perhaps China, a big Africa player, and Russia, could be stronger future allies. We caught the president on his way out of the room and he agreed to an exclusive CNN interview on the spot. We were whisked to the elegant boardroom and offices and set up. My colleagues Fabian and Antonia set up a two-camera shoot in five minutes. President Museveni made his argument: gay people are disgusting, and I made mine: they are not. He laid out his case based on the scientific research he was presented with and insisted homosexuality was a learned social behavior that can be unlearned. I was born and bred in Kenya and I believe that each individual has a right and the freedom to love whoever he or she chooses, gay, or straight. But here in Uganda, I am in the minority here. Why is he doing this? Moral conviction, but he is also looking ahead to the 2016 elections and the majority of his electorate is overwhelmingly anti-gay. However Museveni denies it is an election ploy. As I drove past the shimmering Lake Victoria, towards Kampala, one thing was for sure: It's going to take a long time before the West and Uganda can agree on this topic, if they ever will. For now, as the president articulated, the subject is ""a no-go area.""","CNN's Zain Verjee challenges Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni over new anti-gay law .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- The American exploration vessel ""Nautilus"" was supposed to begin broadcasting its undersea archeological and environmental exploration of the Black Sea July 7, according to the expedition's Facebook page. Instead, two days before the launch date, the ship was in Syrian territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, assisting with the recovery of the bodies of two Turkish pilots killed when their reconnaissance jet was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft defenses. The military search and recovery operation marked an unexpected change of course for a research expedition led by Robert Ballard, the undersea explorer who gained fame for discovering the wreckage of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1980s. Syria, Turkey spar over downed jet . ""I think it was our luck that the Nautilus was already docked in Istanbul,"" said Selcuk Unal, a spokesman for Turkey's foreign ministry. ""It had (previously) applied and been approved by our government to perform scientific research in the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea."" Unal told CNN that after the Turkish Phantom RF-4 reconnaissance jet was shot down June 22, Turkish authorities recognized the need for resources capable of operating at extreme depths for the salvage operation. ""When this incident happened, we immediately looked into our resources, including the military and private sector,"" Unal said. But he added that few governments or corporations had submersibles capable of traveling to depths of more than 1,000 meters. The Nautilus, however, specializes in this type of work. ""E/V Nautilus is a 211-foot research vessel equipped with state-of-the-art exploration and telepresence technology,"" said a statement on the expedition's official website. ""Our rotating Corps of Exploration aboard Nautilus will be mapping the geological, biological, archaeological and chemical aspects of these regions to depths of approximately 2,000 meters."" The website also said the Nautilus was equipped with several remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) that typically worked at extreme depths. ""We started to talk to them,"" Unal explained. ""They were kind enough to postpone their scientific research for some time and join the search and rescue operation... they departed Istanbul immediately, and they arrived to the search and rescue area in two-and-a-half days."" Opinion: Why do planes still crash? The Turkish military already had a number of vessels and aircraft operating in the crash zone, an area within Syrian territorial waters. But the operation was tense; Turkish officials said Syrian defenses opened fire on a second Turkish plane that was brought in after the Phantom RF-4 was initially shot down. Turkish officials say the Nautilus is effectively under Turkish military command while participating in the recovery operation. ""We can't risk anything,"" Unal said. ""As part of our agreement, there are still people as we speak from my ministry and from the navy and Turkish air force for coordination purposes on board the Nautilus."" According to a Turkish military statement, the ""Nautilus ship continued a deep search at points determined by Turkish Coast Guard (ship) Cesme by sonar, on 3-4 July, 2012, and the bodies of our pilots and some parts of the plane were reached."" The bodies of Gokhan Ertan and Hasan Huseyin Aksoy were recovered Thursday. They await a memorial ceremony at a Turkish airbase in Malatya on Friday. When contacted by CNN, a spokeswoman for the Nautilus' National Geographic-affiliated expedition said the group would not be commenting on its participation in the Turkish recovery operation. Scientists at the expedition's command center on the campus of the University of Rhode Island also said they could not comment on the emergency operation, though one scientist told a colleague that after the unexpected delay, he was ""eager to get back to doing science"" as soon as possible. The Turkish armed forces have released photographs of pieces of the downed Turkish jet resting on the Mediterranean sea bed. It is highly likely that the photographs were taken by the Nautilus' ROVs. These photos could hold valuable evidence about what weapon was used to shoot down the jet. The Syrian government insists anti-aircraft cannons brought the jet down when it flew within sight of the Syrian coast. Turkey says the jet was flying 13 nautical miles off the Syrian shore, in international airspace, when it was struck by a Syrian surface-to-air missile. Syria's president suggested the military may have thought it was a plane belonging to Israel.

"Cleveland (CNN) -- Seldom does a daughter use such harsh words to describe her own father. Ariel Castro's daughter called him ""the most evil, vile, demonic criminal"" she ever heard of during a CNN exclusive interview Thursday. ""He is dead to me,"" Angie Gregg said of the father police say kidnapped, held captive, raped and beat three young women in Cleveland for about a decade. She had known her ""daddy"" as a ""friendly, caring, doting man."" Now shocked and in disbelief, Gregg says she never wants to see him again. ""There will be no visits; there will be no phone calls,"" she said. ""He can never be Daddy again. I have no sympathy for the man."" As she mulled the accusations against him, she asked, ""How could you?"" ""I wonder this whole time, how he could be so good to us, but he (allegedly) took young women, little girls, someone else's babies, away from these families and over the years never felt enough guilt to just give up and let them free."" Gregg did not think anything out of the ordinary was going on in her childhood home. All that changed Monday when Amanda Berry broke loose. Police freed her fellow captives Georgina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, divulging the secret locked up inside the house at 2207 Seymour Ave. Snapshots: Who are the three women freed in Cleveland? When she first heard the news about their captivity, Gregg said, she ""just wanted to die."" She had known Berry and DeJesus from her school days. Peculiarities she noticed about her father over the years started falling into place in a new, grim light, and they are making her feel ""horrified,"" she said. ""This was going on right under my nose."" An odd place to visit . When she came calling, ""he would take forever to come to the door,"" she said. He always had the house locked up tight. Standing at a window, Castro would often give her a hand signal indicating to her to wait. Then he'd wave her around to the back door, not letting her in through the front of the house. Once inside, visits were fun and cordial. Gregg, her husband and Castro ""ate, looked at photos and listened to music,"" she said. ""He appeared to be happy to see us and never rushed for us to leave."" At times, he would disappear from dinner and give no explanation for his absence. The music was usually turned up loud, but Gregg thought this to be fitting since Castro was a musician. Once she asked if she could go upstairs to see her childhood bedroom. Castro coaxed her out of the idea, telling her, ""Oh, honey, there's so much junk up there. You don't want to go up there,"" she said. Again, she thought nothing of it, ""besides him being a pack rat."" The basement was always locked. Prosecutor: 'Kidnapper operated torture chamber' Clinging to the house . The list of oddities continued. Castro clung to home, never wanting to leave for more than a day, even to visit Gregg out of state when she lived with her family in Indiana. ""He was adamant in the fact that he wanted to leave home early morning and he had to be back by evening,"" Gregg said. Her family often made travel plans with Castro that they then had to cancel because of her father's obsession with his own four walls. Gregg said that she never saw signs of the 6-year-old at her father's house and that she never saw her with him. But about two months ago, he showed her a picture in his cell phone. Gregg asked who it was. Her father told her that the girl was his girlfriend's child by somebody else. ""I figured at the most he had an illegitimate child out there, you know, and I would find out eventually,"" Gregg said. She asked him to get a paternity test. She wanted to know if she had another sister out there somewhere. Now she knows that she does. Daughter Emily Castro in prison for slashing baby's throat . Domestic violence . Gregg recalled fond memories of growing up in the house and fun times with her father. He lined up the children in the backyard and trimmed their bangs himself, she said. He took her for rides on his motorcycle. And he never abused her, she said, or her sisters, as far as she knows. But he beat their mother, Grimilda Figueroa, whom he accused of fooling around with neighbors. He was very jealous, Gregg said. ""When Mom and Dad were fighting, it's like I just wanted to melt into the ground,"" she said. ""I've seen him basically stomp on her like she was a man,"" Gregg remembered. Then after a bludgeoning, her mother had enough, and the family split up. The other children left with her mother, but Gregg stuck by Castro, believing the excuses he made for the violence. She finished growing up under his roof, she said. How this case differed from the 'House of Horrors' A daughter divorced . Gregg is through believing in her father and is appalled at the extent of his alleged deception and cruelty. ""To go to the vigils, to show these girls the footage of their parents' pleas for their return, to rape, starve and beat innocent human beings ... I am disgusted."" Gregg wants the girls who suffered in captivity to get the treatment they need, recover as well as they can and have the best lives possible. It was the first thing she mentioned during the interview. She is relieved to see them and the little girl, her new sister, return to their families. She hopes they can understand her father's actions are not a reflection on her family. ""We don't have monster in our blood,"" she said. Gregg's mother died in 2012 after a bout with brain cancer. Now she has lost her father, too. She still cries for her mother, she said. ""I don't cry for him."" Get all the latest developments in the Cleveland case .

"Washington (CNN) -- What's the most emotional and divisive issue in American politics? Abortion, right? Just this weekend, former Republican front-runner Rick Perry used the abortion issue to slam current Republican front-runner Herman Cain at the Iowa Faith and Freedom forum. Perry said: . ""It is a liberal canard to say I am personally pro-life, but government should stay out of that decision. If that is your view, you are not pro-life, you are pro having-your-cake-and-eating-it-too."" Over the previous week, Herman Cain had alarmed anti-abortion voters with a series of verbal miscues, indicating both that abortion must be stopped but also that the decision should be left to the individual woman, with no role for government. At the Faith and Freedom forum, Cain over-corrected for his week of stumbles: ""No abortions. No exceptions."" That new position goes far beyond the usual pro-life policy, which allows exceptions for rape, child abuse, and to save the life of the mother. Pro-life activists must unhappily confront the probability that many of the leading candidates for the GOP nomination in 2012 - while all professedly pro-life - in reality neither care very much nor think very much about the abortion issue. But now look at the world from the politicians' point of view. They must hold together a coalition that is sliced apart by the abortion issue. Pro-choice Republicans do not hold forums. But they exist, and they have power. With the result that while you can't get nominated for president by the GOP if you are pro-choice (see Giuliani, Rudy), you also can't get nominated if you oppose abortion too much (see Huckabee, Mike). For the politicians, it's all baffling and vexing. And yet -- incredible as it sounds now -- there is reason to expect that the abortion issue may someday just vanish from national politics. After all, that's what happened to the last great moral issue to rattle the American party system: alcohol prohibition. For 70 years from the end of the Civil War to the Great Depression, a human lifetime, the ""drys"" and the ""wets"" mustered all the passion, commitment, and moralism of the pro-life and pro-choice movements of our day. ""It is my opinion that the saloonkeeper is worse than a thief and a murderer. The ordinary thief steals only your money, but the saloonkeeper steals your honor and your character. The ordinary murderer takes your life, but the saloonkeeper murders your soul."" That's from the famous ""booze sermon"" of Billy Sunday, the great popular preacher of the 1910s and 1920s. Thousands of such passionate speeches -- millions more passionate words -- were uttered by names now brown with history: William Jennings Bryan, Carrie Nation, Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It was not all talk. Ferocious legislative battles were bought to prohibit alcohol at the county, state and then ultimately national level. The great scholar of American politics, Judith Shklar, estimated to her graduate students that through the long run of American history, more elections at more levels of government have turned on alcohol than any other issue, including slavery. Politicians hated the alcohol issue for the same reason they now dislike the abortion issue: It sliced apart the existing party structure. The Republicans could not win a national majority without the support of Protestant immigrants from Germany in cities like Milwaukee and St. Louis. The Democrats could not win without the enthusiastic support of Irish Catholics in New York and New England. City-dwelling Germans and Irish intensely resented attempts of their country-dwelling neighbors to regulate their behavior for them. ""If they don't feel like takin' a glass of beer on Sunday, we must abstain,"" a contemporary Irish-American politician bitterly complained. ""If they have not got any amusements up in their backwoods, we mustn't have none."" National politicians responded to Prohibition then in the same way they respond to abortion now: by looking for ways to avoid and de-escalate a destabilizing issue. ""Questions based upon temperance, religion, morality, in all their multiplied forms, ought not to be the basis of politics,"" declared Senator John Sherman of Ohio in 1873. ""We don't want to alienate anybody!"" complained a Michigan Republican leader of the 1880s as quoted in a contemporary newspaper. As Richard Jensen observes in his classic history, ""The Winning of the Midwest"", ""Very few prominent Republican politicians were abstainers ... The politicians were not less likely to be churchgoers (many voters, after all, attended church), but they had developed their own standards of personal morality."" Then as now! And yet a century later ... the issue is dead. Vanished. Forgotten. What happened? Three things. 1. Alcohol prohibition did finally get a national trial, from 1919-1933 and was universally experienced even by former supporters as a disaster. 2. The problem addressed by prohibition has dwindled away. While it's difficult to know with any precision how much people drank in the years after the Civil War, it's almost certain that 19th Century Americans drank much more than they do today. (For that matter, Americans today drink nearly 20% less than they did as recently as 1980.) 3. And maybe most important, drinking and non-drinking are no longer so intimately associated with other ethno-cultural divisions within American life. As alcohol ceased to be a cultural symbol, the appropriate regulation of alcohol ceased to be an ideological issue. When alcohol regulation flared up again in the 1980s, during the debate over stricter punishments for drunk driving, the debate never turned into a culture war because ""alcohol"" was not code (as it had been a century before) for a dozen other identities and grievances. Can we imagine such a fate for the abortion issue? Condition number one could well happen, and would be revolutionary. But even in its absence, condition number two is beginning to obtain in the United States. In the early 1980s, there were some 29 abortions per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. Today that rate has declined to about 19 abortions per 1,000 women. The rate will never reach zero, but we may expect that it will continue to decline as contraceptives improve and attitudes to out-of-wedlock birth become more accepting, and as younger generations increasingly reject abortion as an acceptable resolution of a pregnancy. What about condition three? Alcohol became central to American politics at a time when Americans were arguing whether the country should be rural or urban, a farm economy or industrial, and whether Catholics could ever become good Americans. As those arguments lost their intensity, so did the alcohol issue. Abortion became central to modern politics at exactly the same time as Americans were arguing over sexuality generally, over the status of women and the rights of gays. I think it's a good guess that if we come to a new consensus about the status of women -- absorbing and digesting the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the feminist revolution of the 1970s into a new dispensation more comfortable with both women's equality to men and their differences from men -- disagreements over abortion will come to matter less. Such disagreements won't disappear, any more than we've seen the end of debates about whether bars should open on Sundays. But the disagreements won't matter so furiously much as they now seem to do. Too bad for Herman Cain that day still seems at least a couple of decades remote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Herman Cain's comments on abortion brought him heavy criticism .

"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (CNN) -- Hundreds of Christians packed the Church of the Nativity on Thursday for a midnight Mass in what is thought to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ. A worshipper touches a star at the point where tradition says Jesus Christ was born in the Church of Nativity. The standing-room-only service included singing and organ music. There were also large crowds outside the church, one of the most sacred places in Christianity. So many people had flocked to the area this Christmas season that there were no rooms left at the inns and hotels in Bethlehem. Some took this as a sign that tourism in Bethlehem was on the upswing. Christmas is the one time of year when the West Bank's small, shrinking Christian communities show everyone else that they are still there. Before the midnight Mass, Palestinian scout groups representing Christians throughout the West Bank did as they always do on this day -- they marched, banging their drums loudly and, in a way, trying to make a point.  Watch Bethlehem's Christmas celebrations » . The drumbeat has been heard by more and more people, locals say, as tourism has skyrocketed this year. ""This year, tourism is much better than last year -- we reached 1,250,000,"" said Victor Batarseh, the mayor of Bethlehem. ""All our hotels are full around Christmastime. We have 30,000 tourists coming in."" Tourists in record numbers were on hand this year, braving an unusually cold, gray and windy day to watch the parade of drums and holiday songs. ""It's kind of neat to see it in the Middle East, and they're playing Christmas carols and the songs we know,"" said one American tourist. ""I'm loving it, it's just been an incredible atmosphere and just a wonderful learning experience,"" said another. The Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem also came to the birthplace of Jesus, as he does every Christmas Eve, allowed through normally tightly shut gates by Israeli troops. The heavy security is a testament to ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. ""My Christmas wish is that we will have real peace, based on justice and freedom,"" said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian parliament member. ""My Christmas wish is that the justice that Jesus Christ gave his life for will happen sometime in his birthplace in Palestine."" CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Hundreds of Christians pack Church of the Nativity Thursday for midnight Mass .

"(CNN) -- Citing the threat of avalanches, officials Tuesday suspended the search for two hikers missing since Friday morning on Mount Hood and held out little hope they would be found alive. ""Could they be alive?"" asked Dr. Terri Schmidt, physician supervisor for American Medical Response in Clackamas County, Oregon. ""Yes. Is it very likely? No."" The specialist in emergency medicine noted that time is not in their favor. ""What we know is that at about 48 hours -- two days -- the chances of finding somebody alive after that go down to about 1 percent."" She added, ""At some point, we have to say it's time."" Still, she said, Anthony Vietti, 24, and Katie Nolan, 29, have several factors in their favor: ""They're young; they're healthy; they -- as far as we can tell -- are relatively experienced and relatively well-equipped."" The body of a third hiker, 26-year-old Luke Gullberg, was found dead Saturday from hypothermia. Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts said Tuesday that, despite the odds, the the search operation had not moved into a recovery operation. In fact, the search was not continuing in any form. Operations coordinator Nate Thompson bemoaned the heavy snow that fell over the weekend and forced the suspension. ""A lot of our clues are now covered,"" he said. Steve Rollins, a team leader with Portland Mountain Rescue, said the avalanche danger would not permit rescuers to venture out any time soon. ""Slopes that do not normally avalanche are avalanching now,"" he said. ""I don't see that we're going to have conditions that will permit us to put anybody safely on the ground in the foreseeable future."" Thompson hypothesized that the hikers may have been involved in an accident and that Gullberg, the most experienced of the hikers, may have broken away from the others and begun to backtrack in an effort to seek help. Above his body, rescuers found a water bottle, a helmet, a harness, a camera and camera case and a mitten belonging to Nolan. ""Maybe Katie lost a mitten in an accident,"" Thompson said. If Gullberg did indeed seek to return for help and Nolan lost one of her mittens in an accident, he may have left his gear, his pack and his supplies and gloves with her, taking the lone mitten, he said. But descending can be more difficult than climbing in some places. ""If there was some form of an accident and Luke did downclimb, this is a much more difficult descent,"" he said. National Weather Service meteorologist Charles Dalton told CNN that some 15 inches of snow had fallen at an altitude of about 6,000 feet between Monday and Tuesday afternoon, when temperatures were just below freezing. The three hikers, all from the Pacific Northwest, set out at about 1 a.m. Friday (4 a.m. ET), on what was to have been a fairly easy, ""semi-technical"" hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain, said Deputy Scott Meyers of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. Vietti's home is Longview, Washington; Nolan's is Portland, Oregon. Gullberg was from Des Moines, Washington. Gullberg's MySpace page is filled with photos of him hiking in various places. The mountain rises 11,239 feet above sea level, with a base that stretches across 92 miles (148 km). It is the highest mountain in Oregon. Mount Hood is a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes, according to the Web site mthood.info. Gullberg's death is the latest of many accidents on Mount Hood, KPTV reported. The worst occurred in May 1986 when nine people, including seven students from Oregon Episcopal School, died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm.","Officials cite avalanche threat, hold out little hope two hikers are still alive .

"(CNN) -- How do Burmese punks keep their mohawks standing tall? Why does cash in Myanmar need to be kept clean? What does making a kissing sound in a Yangon restaurant get you? As recently as a year ago, few people would have cared about the answers to any of these questions. But newfound political freedom has brought a surge in tourism to the once isolated country, making Myanmar a 2013 traveler's hot spot, and a place worth getting up to speed on. Fall in love with Burmese food . 1. New Year celebrations last four days . The Burmese make a big deal of the New Year. Thingyan, known as the ""water throwing festival,"" is celebrated in April. This year it takes place April 13-16. Everything shuts down over the four-day New Year -- banks, restaurants, shops. The biggest celebrations are in Yangon and Mandalay. During the New Year water-throwing frenzy everyone throws and sprays water at each other. Staying dry isn't an option. Water symbolizes the washing away of the previous year's bad luck and sins. On New Year's Day, the fourth day of the festival, fish and birds are released as acts of merit and feasts are held for monks. In recent years of privation, hard-core Burmese punks used leather glue to spike up their hair at New Year. The superstrong glue meant their mohawks stayed standing through the Water Festival, but when the party was over they had to shave their hair. These days, Burmese punks use hairspray. Myanmar: Is now a good time to go? 2. Myanmar has fantastic beaches . Myanmar has 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) of coastline and some of the finest stretches of beach in Asia. Many beaches along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea remain undiscovered by tourists and unspoiled by development. Many of them face west, so they produce great sunsets. The best known is Ngapali Beach, a 45-minute flight from Yangon, where almost two miles of white sand are lined with palm trees overlooking the Andaman Sea. Here, you'll find a number of large resorts. Less developed is Ngwe Saung, a beautifully unspoiled beach that's a five-hour drive from Yangon. Also called Silver Beach, its eight-mile (13 kilometers) stretch makes it one of the longest beaches in Asia. 3. The Internet isn't censored anymore, but it's still slow . The Internet arrived in Myanmar in 2000, but high prices and slow connections mean it's still not widely used. Under the former government, websites such as YouTube and Gmail were blocked, but restrictions have largely been lifted and last month Google chairman Eric Schmidt visited the country. Far more popular than the Internet are mobile phones, though here, too, prices are high compared with other Asian countries. Local IT firms are lobbying to introduce cheaper SIM cards and a breakthrough is expected soon. A U.S.$15 SIM card for mobile phones will be made available in June, in the run-up to the Southeast Asian Games to be held in Myanmar in December, but will be available only to foreigners. 4. You'll need plenty of cash -- and make sure it's clean . There are few ATMs in Myanmar, so visitors need to bring plenty of U.S. dollars. The higher the denomination, the better the exchange rate. Your greenbacks should be squeaky clean -- that means no creases, stains, marks or tears. A note that's folded or even a little worn is worthless in Myanmar. At present, credit cards are accepted only in five-star hotels and up-market shops and restaurants, usually with a 2-3% fee added to the bill. But this is changing. By the end of the year, credit cards should be more widely accepted. The local currency is the kyat (pronounced ""chat"") and U.S.$1 will get you about 882 kyat. The new 10,000-kyat note (less than U.S.$12) is the highest denomination -- be prepared for a bulging wallet. There's little worry about carrying a lot of cash. Crime against foreigners is rare and the Burmese -- the vast majority of whom are Buddhist -- are generally honest. Myanmar records 1 million tourists, surge in tourism income . 5. A kissing sound gets you a beer . When the Burmese want to get a waiter's attention they make a kissing sound, usually two or three short kisses. It's the sort of sound you might make if calling a cat. Walk down 19 Street in Yangon's Chinatown and you'll hear that kissing sound a lot. This narrow, pedestrian-only street is where the Burmese come to drink. Restaurants line either side of the street and chairs and tables are set out in front. The local brew is Myanmar Beer and it's cheap -- about 60 cents for a glass of draught. This is prime people-watching territory and if you keep an eye out you'll spot Yangon's hip-hop royalty on the prowl. Just don't expect to see any females. Most Burmese women -- married and single -- stay home in the evening. That's not to say Western women aren't welcome. It's understood that foreigners have different customs. 6. Hotels are expensive . Room rates shot up 350% last year, which means that a room that cost U.S.$25 a night in 2011 now goes for almost U.S.$100. It's a simple matter of supply and demand. Since the country opened up, business travelers and tourists have been packing flights to Myanmar. There are a lot more visitors -- more than a million last year -- but roughly the same number of hotels. More hotels are on the way, but they take time to build and the hotel shortage is expected to continue five to 10 years. Book accommodation well ahead. A lot of hotels are renovating and since they don't want to miss out on the visitor boom, they're staying open while upgrading. When making a reservation it's worth checking to see if any work is in progress and, if so, requesting a room away from the noise. Myanmar hit by severe hotel shortage . 7. The men wear skirts . The traditional Burmese dress is the longyi, a wraparound skirt worn by men and women. Men tie theirs in the front and women fold the cloth over and secure it at the side. NLD Leader Aung San Suu Kyi is known for her beautiful longyis and tailored tops. Her high-profile appearances have helped boost the popularity of the traditional dress among young women in Myanmar. As for what's worn underneath, that's a matter of personal preference. In the cities, Burmese men usually wear underwear beneath their longyis when they go out, but at home wear it as the Scots wear their kilts. In the countryside, underwear is much less common -- for men and women. As one man jokingly put it: ""Longyi are great. Free air-conditioning."" That's a plus, especially when the summer temperature tips 104 F (40 C). It's completely acceptable for a foreigner to wear a longyi and can be a conversation starter. 8. The food is exceptional . It's considered rude to eat with the left hand as this is the hand used for personal hygiene. To spell that out -- the left hand does the job of toilet paper. So eating -- as well as giving money -- is always done with the right hand. A typical Burmese meal includes steamed rice, fish, meat, vegetables and soup and all the dishes arrive at the same time. The Burmese use their fingertips to mold the rice into a small ball and then mix it with various dishes. As is the norm, Buddhists usually avoid eating beef and the Muslims don't eat pork. Meals are served with plenty of condiments -- from sweet to savory -- and everyone has their preferred way of customizing a dish. Myanmar vs. Burma. Which do you prefer? 9. The trains are seriously bumpy . The poor condition of railway tracks means carriages get shaken about. This makes for a bouncy ride, but trains are still a great way to see the country. Myanmar's trains are slow and have a reputation for running late. The most reliable route, Yangon to Mandalay, takes about 16 hours, assuming no delays. On overnight trains, there's more chance of getting some shut-eye in an upper class seat than in a sleeper. It can get surprisingly cold a few hours after dusk, so it's smart to bring something warm to wear. Buses are usually a faster option, but they're often crowded. Domestic flights are the most comfortable way to cover long distances and relatively cheap. 10. Yangon has a newspaper vendor on every street corner . After five decades under a repressive military regime, the Burmese are enjoying their newfound press freedom and showing a healthy appetite for news. In the past, all publications had to submit their stories to the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division for approval. Censorship was gradually phased out in 2012 and at the beginning of this year the bureau was formally abolished. Under the former ruling military junta, Myanmar had a reputation for jailing anyone who dared voice opposition; that included many in the media. Last year was the first year since 1996 that no journalists were jailed. Burmese journalists who fled the country and were forced to live in exile are slowly returning. April 1 was a landmark for the country's media. For the first time since 1964, daily newspapers were permitted. It's a big step for press freedom, but there are concerns that some of the popular weekly newspapers will struggle to make the transition to daily circulation. 11. The people with red teeth aren't vampires . Chewing betel nut is a national pastime. Small street stalls selling the palm-sized green leaves are everywhere. The leaves are filled with hard squares of betel nut, spices and sometimes a pinch of tobacco and then folded up and popped in the mouth and chewed. You have to chew a while before you feel the mild narcotic effect of the betel nut. At about 6 cents a wrap it's a cheap hit, but there's a downside. Not only does betel nut stain your teeth a reddish-brown, the little packages are spat out on the floor when finished -- making for messy sidewalks. It's also highly addictive.

"(CNN) -- Is ballet dying? Isabella Boylston, the 27-year-old new principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, says it's not. Born in Idaho, she started dancing at 3 even though no one in her family knew anything about it. Her love for ballet has taken her touring around the world. While ballet is still very much admired, this classical and rigorous art form is no longer enjoying the popularity it once had in its glory heydays. ""For most of the 20th century, including the entire post-war period, ballet was central to our cultural life. Now more than ever before it needs to be connected to the culture and the direction we're heading,"" says Jennifer Homans, a dance critic who has written about the history of ballet. Homans says the tremendous social changes that occurred after the 1990s affected ballet's cultural prominence. The important question now is: What is the place of ballet in a rapidly changing and high-tech society where people like to watch three-minute YouTube videos or check text messages constantly? To help revitalize ballet in the 21st century, New York University is opening the Center for Ballet and the Arts on September 22. ""The big issue is the future of ballet. It is being reinvented as we speak -- and that takes time, talent and resources,"" says Homans, who is the heading the center. With this new ballet think tank, and with dancers like Boylston who is full of optimism, will ballet leap gracefully into the 22nd century? Time will tell. CNN spoke with Boylston about what it's like to live and breathe ballet today. Why should we care about ballet? Ballet is such a unique art form. You can say things through dance that you could never express in words, and ballet has the ability to touch people on a deep, abstract level. In some ways, ballet is more valuable now than ever. Everything today is so fast-paced and technologically overloaded -- people are constantly staring into computers or their phone screens for entertainment. But going to the theater to see a ballet is unique in that it's completely live and in the moment -- unfiltered and unedited. It's a real and tangible meditation. What sparked your passion for dance? I was about 11 when I completely fell in love with ballet. I was going to this little ballet school situated above a tavern, and we had live piano music, which is really rare for ballet class at that age. My teacher would bring a bag full of silk scarves and at the end of each class we would each take one and dance around and improvise to the music. It felt so free and was the perfect outlet for my creativity. I also loved watching dance movies. I loved ""Center Stage"" and ""The Turning Point."" Do you have a favorite character? So far, it's been Giselle. It's about a girl who falls in love for the first time and she's on this incredible high, then she gets betrayed and everything comes crashing down. She goes completely mad in front of everyone onstage and dies. In the second act she comes back as a spirit and finds forgiveness within herself. When I performed it this past season, I felt like I became her. It was so emotional, and I could feel so much support from the other dancers onstage. Everyone was invested in the story. Another favorite role is Odette/Odile in ""Swan Lake."" The Tchaikovsky score is incredible, and I love the animalistic swan imagery. It's a fun challenge to play up the contrast between White Swan and the Black Swan. What are the 3 most painful things you've ever had to do? Most people don't realize how athletic ballet is -- you have to be so mentally strong to be a dancer. One of the toughest things I had to do was Act 2 of ""Swan Lake"" when I was in the Corps de Ballet. You have to stand very still on one leg in a position called b plus for what seems like an eternity, after jumping and doing hard dancing. Your feet cramp and everything hurts. When I first performed it as a teenager, I think I had tears streaming down my face. But then you learn how to pace yourself and it becomes more enjoyable. Another ballet is ""Theme and Variations,"" by George Balanchine. It's definitely one of the hardest things I've done. You get unbelievably tired, to the point that it feels almost impossible to get through. I've seen people throw up in the wings from exhaustion after it. It's the same with Black Swan Pas de Deux from ""Swan Lake"". But, I don't focus on the pain. We love what we do. And it's the best feeling when you get through something really physically hard and the curtain comes down and you've given it your all physically and emotionally. How many hours do your dance every day? On average, I probably dance for 7 to 9 hours a day. We start every day with ballet ""class,"" which is a series of exercises you do to maintain strength and warm up. That's followed by rehearsals and sometimes a performance at night. What do you say to people who say ballet is boring? They've probably never seen a great ballet with great dancers. For instance, if you watch a bad football game it can be boring, too. Ballet has something for everyone to admire. If you don't like the choreography, you can listen to the music, and if you hate that too, then at least there are beautiful people onstage. There are some young choreographers working today like Justin Peck, who make ballets that are the farthest thing from boring. We are making a dance film together that will come out later this year. Stay tuned! Do your feet hurt all the time? Actually, no. Your feet become accustomed to being en pointe and our pointe shoes are surprisingly supportive, taking the stress off your toes. Other parts of my body hurt though. Ironically, the harder I'm working the less pain I have, because your body gets into crazy shape. Any indulgences? I've been pretty lucky and can eat pretty much whatever I want, especially when we are in season. On a show day I always have a bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast. I don't eat a lot of sweets. My favorite food is pasta, specifically bucatini all'amatriciana, which I discovered when I was performing in Rome. And I love having a glass of wine after a show.","Isabella Boylston is a principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre in New York City .

"Los Angeles (CNN)One of seven patients infected by the deadly superbug bacteria CRE is blaming a manufacturer of the medical scope used in his endoscopic procedure at a Los Angeles hospital, the patient's attorney said Thursday. The accusation was made on the same day the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety advisory about how the scope's design may impede effective cleaning. The patient, an 18-year-old high school student whose name wasn't released, is planning to sue one of the scope's manufacturers, said attorney Kevin Boyle. The student was ""very, very close to death,"" Boyle said. ""He's not doing well now."" That manufacturer, Olympus, is one of three that the FDA has identified as makers of the scope. Olympus said the firm provides instructions, guidance and supplemental educational materials on how to conduct effective cleaning of its endoscopes, also called duodenoscopes. ""While all endoscopes, including duodenoscopes, require thorough reprocessing after patient use in order to be safe, the Olympus TJF-Q180V requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps, including meticulous manual cleaning, to ensure effective reprocessing,"" which is a reuse of the same device, said Mark A. Miller, the company's executive director of communications and marketing. In addition to instructions and guidance given to every customer, Olympus makes available supplemental educational materials on cleaning the devices. Miller said. ""Olympus is monitoring this issue closely including today's safety communication from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We are working with the FDA, relevant medical societies and our customers regarding these concerns,"" Miller said. Meanwhile, the other two manufacturers identified by the FDA, Fujifilm and Pentax, couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. Understanding CRE, the 'nightmare' superbug . In all, seven patients at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center have caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments for bile ducts, gall bladder or pancreas, and two of them have died, a hospital spokeswoman said. The deadly bacteria CRE, or carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, was a contributing factor in the deaths, but the exact cause of those deaths wasn't immediately disclosed, a hospital spokeswoman said. The medical center is contacting 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January and is offering them home tests to screen for the deadly bacteria. The 18-year-old patient went to the UCLA hospital for a suspected leaking pancreas in 2014, Boyle said. But the outpatient endoscopic procedure didn't reveal a leaking pancreas, and the youth returned home, Boyle said. Later, the young man was taken to a hospital again, where he remained for more than 80 days, Boyle said. The patient also spent time in intensive care, Boyle added. The attorney declined to state whether the second hospital visit was at the same UCLA facility. The attorney also said Thursday the patient doesn't blame the UCLA hospital for his infection. The UCLA hospital was scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday afternoon at 5:30 p.m. ET on the superbug incident. The patient was released from hospitalization, but within the last two weeks, he returned a third time to a hospital, where he remains, Boyle said Thursday. The attorney also declined to identify that hospital. Boyle alleges that in mid-2014, Olympus altered the design of the endoscope and removed a cleaning channel but didn't change the cleaning protocol. The scoping procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy said. The medical procedure is used to, among other things, unblock bile ducts and take care of pancreas issues. ""It is estimated that more than 500,000 ERCPs are performed each year in the U.S.,"" the society said. ""From what we know, over the past few years, there have been fewer than 100 known cases of transmission of these problematic bacteria through ERCP."" The ERCP procedure involves a duodenoscope, a flexible, lighted tube that is threaded through the mouth, throat, stomach and into the top of the small intestine (the duodenum), the FDA said. The device contains a hollow channel that allows the injection of contrast dye or the insertion of other instruments to obtain tissue samples for biopsy or treat certain abnormalities. The device also has a movable ""elevator"" mechanism at the tip, the agency said. Even meticulously cleaning the devices before high-level disinfection ""may not entirely eliminate"" the risk of transmitting infection, the FDA said. ""Reprocessing is a detailed, multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable devices. Recent medical publications and adverse event reports associate multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in patients who have undergone ERCP with reprocessed duodenoscopes, even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly,"" the FDA said. ""Although the complex design of duodenoscopes improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ERCP, it causes challenges for cleaning and high-level disinfection. Some parts of the scopes may be extremely difficult to access and effective cleaning of all areas of the duodenoscope may not be possible,"" the FDA said. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt and John Bonifield contributed to this report.","A patient, 18, is hospitalized with a deadly CRE superbug infection, attorney says .

"(CNN)Goodbye, Stephen Colbert. We hardly knew you. In fact, that was the idea, wasn't it? Colbert -- the pugnacious, ""nation""-inspiring champion -- hosted his last ""Colbert Report"" on Comedy Central Thursday night. About six months from now, he will take a new role as host of CBS' ""Late Show."" It will be like Superman changing into Clark Kent -- or, perhaps, into Kal-El. For the Colbert we've been watching bears only a tangential resemblance to the real thing. The real Colbert, as revealed in profiles in the New Yorker and The New York Times, is a modest family man, a devout Catholic with three children who's ""extremely normal,"" one of his neighbors said. The Colbert of the ""Colbert Report"" is bombastic and ironic, equal parts Bill O'Reilly (who's referred to as ""Papa Bear"" on the show) and David Letterman, the man the real Colbert is replacing. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that bombast and irony have paid off handsomely for the onetime ""Daily Show"" correspondent and ""Strangers with Candy"" actor. In some ways, he has become the power he's ridiculed. Without Colbert, we wouldn't have a word for what's now called ""truthiness,"" the concept that if you feel it in your gut, it must be true. (It was Merriam-Webster's word of the year in 2006: the power of Stephen at work.) We wouldn't ""Know a District"" and the sometimes humorless people who are elected to them. And we wouldn't understand how to turn the other cheek to Internet activists who wanted to #cancelColbert. Colbert 'Late Show' staying in New York . Yes, occasionally the Colbert alter ego pushed boundaries a little fiercely. When he was the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner, his scathing jokes about President Bush, the Bush administration and the news media -- delivered with all mere feet away -- hit close to home.   (So close, in fact, that the entertainment for the 2007 dinner was provided by the much safer Rich Little.) And then there was the Colbert super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow. Colbert thought it would show the absurdity of campaign finance laws. It did -- but mainly because both Democrats and Republicans were willing to go along with it. Anything for money, it seems. It's a funhouse mirror that Colbert's partner in crime, Jon Stewart, has willingly supported. Both have found comedy gold through mockery, but if Stewart is the exasperated uncle, Colbert has been the mischievous nephew. By questioning reality through a character, Colbert has actually shown how absurd real reality often is. Obama fills in for Stephen Colbert . No wonder he'll be missed. Who else can symbolize America with a Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor, a NASA device and a minor league hockey mascot? Colbert IS the Real America. Even President Obama paid tribute. Occasionally he's shown us who he is underneath the character, of course. He answered a Reddit AMA very much as himself, and took the time to be a grown man for a Rookie magazine feature. He may be that guy when his ""Late Show"" stint begins. But we don't know who the new Colbert will be. Will he be full of smarm, like a Martin Short parody? A puckish intellectual, a la Dick Cavett? A rollicking Steve Allen type? Whatever he is, he's said he's leaving the ""Colbert Report's"" Colbert behind. Colbert's time slot will be well-cared for, thanks to Larry Wilmore and the ""Nightly Show,"" which will follow Stewart's ""Daily Show"" starting January 19. But his impact may never be equaled. Surprisingly, Colbert was worried that the character wouldn't sustain. As he told The New York Times, ""I thought topical stuff had an ephemeral quality -- it would be meaningless in a week. I wanted my character to be eternal."" No worries there, Stephen Colbert. We'll always remember.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will be looking for nations around the world to get tougher on Iran in the wake of the alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, a senior State Department official said Tuesday. The official said that although Iran is under multiple sanctions, many countries are not enforcing the restrictions, and sometimes if they have problems with Iran, they don't speak out publicly. The official said the United States is going to be looking for countries to enforce existing sanctions, implement new ones and cut ties with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, to basically match what the United States has already done. To make the case, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other senior officials in the department are going to be placing calls to leaders and foreign ministers, U.N. Security Council members and others with influence on Iran, the official said. The official said the United States is looking for what Clinton calls a ""chorus of international condemnation"" of Iran. A senior administration official, asked if there will be sanctions on more individuals related to this particular plot, responded, ""We've done what we think is the network here."" Asked what actions the United States would take next, the official said, ""We are continuing to look for additional ways to apply financial sanctions on Iran. We are very much in the business of increasing pressure on Iran through sanctions so Iran understands they have a clear choice to be made between coming to the table seriously (and) meaningfully, and facing further isolation and sanction. ""We're continuing on that course."" Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns plans brief the diplomatic corps Wednesday at the State Department on the alleged Iran plot, a second senior department official said Tuesday. The official described it as an ""informational briefing"" and said that Burns will explain the details of how it went down, how the Obama administration handled it and the need to hold Iran accountable. A third senior State Department official told CNN that the briefing will also try to allay any concerns that were raised in diplomats by word of an assassination plot against an ambassador in Washington. The official said the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security is working with the Secret Service and ""taking all appropriate measures"" to protect foreign diplomats and diplomatic facilities.

"Washington (CNN) -- When it comes to 2016, Hillary Clinton is in no rush to decide about another run for the White House. This amid mounting speculation that Clinton will launch another bid, and with everything she says, and every move she makes, scrutinized for signals of where she stands when it comes to her political future. ""I'm not in any hurry. I think it's a serious decision, not to be made lightly, but it's also not one that has to be made soon,"" Clinton told New York Magazine in her first interview since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of this year. Far from her denials in interviews at the beginning of the year, when she told CNN that she had ""absolutely no plans to run,"" Clinton now appears to be wrestling with a decision, saying in the New York Magazine interview that ""I will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision."" Hillary Clinton on 2016 run: 'I'm realistic' Even as Clinton 2016 story count keeps rising many Democrats both inside and outside Clinton World agree that, because of who she is, she doesn't need to be the first one out of the gate to announce her 2016 intentions. ""There is definitely no rush for Hillary to decide about 2016,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. ""As someone who wants her to run, I still understand that she has lots of time. No one should try to rush Hillary on this. She has earned the right to advance her mission in the foundation. Hillary has earned the unique status she has today, and there is no need for her to be pressured into diving back into the political swamp."" Thanks to her name recognition, the former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys. In the most recent survey, conducted earlier this month by CNN/ORC International, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back Clinton as their presidential nominee. Vice President Joe Biden came in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6%, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at 2%. The CNN survey was in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated Clinton was far ahead of all the other possible Democratic contenders. Begala, who was a senior political adviser to President Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton's ""time horizon and the whole rest of the party's time horizon are very, very different,"" adding that ""anybody else has got to start to lay the groundwork"" much earlier than Clinton."" ""Hillary has more time than anyone else. And that's why her friends, and I'm one of them, are saying she can take her time. She doesn't need to build name identification. She doesn't even need to build a roster of donors."" Translation: Don't expect to see Clinton make a stop in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina anytime soon, as some of the other potential 2016ers, such as O'Malley and even Biden, have already made. Clinton already has a superPAC named ""Ready for Hillary"" actively raising money in support of a possible 2016 bid. And the political action committee that Begala advises, ""Priorities USA,"" which was formed in 2011 to back President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign and spent millions on TV ads critical of Mitt Romney, could play a similar role for Clinton should she run again. Asked if there is a concern that if Clinton waits too long, some big name donors and influential Democratic politicians could stray to other 2016 candidates, Begala said such a scenario is ""not a concern at all."" Not all Democrats agree. ""She is the prohibitive favorite, but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits. So the question is how long can she wait,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and a veteran of the Wesley Clark 2004 and John Edwards 2008 presidential campaigns. ""If she gets in early, she sucks up the oxygen, the money, and the grassroots. She could basically kill the field."" Palin: Hillary Clinton ill-suited to be president . When it comes to polling, Clinton's standing now compares to her situation the first time she ran for president, when she was the Democratic favorite in the early years of the 2008 presidential cycle. She was the front-runner in CNN polling from mid-2005 through 2006, prior to her January 2007 announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee, which formally kicked off her presidential fundraising and campaigning. By then, Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Biden, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico had all jumped in. Pelosi: Hillary Clinton more ready for White House than husband, Obama were . Clinton and Obama eventually went on to battle each other in a historic primary season, which ended with Clinton ending her bid for the nomination in June 2008, at the conclusion of the primary calendar. Ben LaBolt, a veteran of three presidential campaigns, suggests there may be a middle ground for Clinton. ""Secretary Clinton faces a paradoxical choice: If she announces that she's re-entering the political fray, scrutiny on her would be heightened exponentially. Yet even without an announcement, the press and her potential opponents are already treating her like she is running,"" said LaBolt, who served as a deputy press secretary for Obama's 2008 campaign and national press secretary for the 2012 re-election campaign. ""The solution might be to ensure trusted advisers are working from the outside to manage rapid response, cultivate donors and study her prospective competitors' records to lay the groundwork for a run for as long as possible without jumping two feet in."" Clinton herself downplays any imminent announcement, saying such speculation isn't good for the country. ""It's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there,"" Clinton said. ""And you want to talk to them about something that's really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what's next. I feel like that's our political process right now. I just don't think it is good.""","Hillary Clinton tells an interviewer that she's wrestling with a 2016 decision .

"(CNN) -- She's laid down the law in female skiing for the past five years, now Lindsey Vonn is pondering legal action in her quest to test herself against the men. The International Ski Federation (FIS) blocked her bid to challenge the sport's top male stars at a recent meeting in Canada, but as Vonn has proved throughout her glittering career to date she's no quitter. Speaking exclusively to CNN ahead of an Alpine World Cup event in Val d'Isere, France, the finest female skier of her generation insisted this fight wasn't over. Vonn said: ""I was definitely disappointed with their decision. After discussing with them my request they seemed pretty positive and optimistic that we could find a solution and then I got their answer and they were completely against it. ""I don't want to make a big stink out of it but I feel like their response that I can't race with the men simply because I'm a woman was definitely gender-biased so I'm going to do what I can and hopefully make something work. ""So right now I'm looking into options -- my father is an attorney so I'm just seeing if there's any options, legally, that I can take."" It is a brave person who pits their wits against Vonn. The 28-year-old already has a cabinet stuffed full of silverware, including Olympic gold at Vancouver in 2010, and is officially the second most successful female skier of all time. Vonn is renowned in Europe's skiing heartlands and a bona fide star in North America but she claims a battle with the male fraternity would elevate the sport to new heights in her homeland. She responded to the FIS ruling in typical fashion by sweeping all three downhill events at Lake Louise in Canada, despite crashing during one, and all that on the back of recovering from a stomach illness which left her hospitalized in November. Vonn was also on the podium at the most recent meeting in St. Moritz and is third in the overall standings as she strives for a fifth career Alpine World Cup title. But as she continues her preparation for this weekend's meet at Val d'Isere, her other goal has clearly not been forgotten. ""I don't see Lindsey giving up anytime soon, that's for sure, she'll try another avenue,"" said 1992 Olympic champion Kerrin Lee-Gartner, who thinks Vonn would have finished around 20th had her wish to race the men at Lake Louise been granted. ""She's doing this for her but with that she also appreciates what it'll do for skiing in North America and the United States. People know who she is but they don't really understand the depth of her greatness."" U.S. women's head coach Alex Hoedlmoser agrees with Lee-Gartner. The Austrian, himself a former national giant slalom champion, says Vonn's commitment sets her apart from her competitors. ""It's obvious that she has put all of her energy into the sport in the last five years,"" Hoedlmoser explained to CNN. ""That makes her special. She's living for her sport. She's prepared like nobody else going into races. That makes a difference."" After her new-season successes, the Minnesota native now has a career total of 57 victories, pushing her ahead of Switzerland's Vreni Schnieder and into second on the all-time win list. Only legendary Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proll remains ahead of Vonn, on 62 career victories, a tally that, barring injury, surely she will surpass. ""Moser-Proll was an unbelievable champion and won a lot of races at that time,"" added Hoedlmoser. ""But there wasn't the same competition then. ""The sport is getting more complex, it is harder to break those records. I think she [Vonn] is the greatest so far and it is a matter of time before she breaks those records."" Vonn, a four-time Alpine World Cup champion, lobbied the FIS to race the men at Lake Louise as it is one of the few meets in the skiing calendar where males and females compete on the same slopes. But a diktat from the sport's governing body ruled ""one gender is not entitled to participate in the races of the other."" ""It's not like I'm getting 20th every day and saying I want to race the men,"" Vonn told reporters in Canada. ""I try to let my skiing speak for itself. ""I don't know exactly where I'd stack up, but that's kind of the whole point, to see where I stand and see how much farther I can push my skiing because the men, they're skiing is the best in the world hands down. That's where I want to get my skiing to be."" A perfect illustration of Vonn's supremacy came at the venue that starts the weekend as Lake Louise, and ends it as Lake Lindsey. ""She was near-perfect the first day,"" Lee-Gartner explained. ""On the second day she made a major mistake and it was almost disastrous, she had her tails of her skis in the net, she was almost sideways and she still won by half a second. ""It's difficult for her to maintain the elite level of focus throughout the season. For Lindsey she is very goal orientated, she feeds off any doubt whatsoever. She says it fuels her fire and makes her go."" Vonn is not alone in her quest, and she points to female golfer Anneka Sorenstam as an inspiration in her battle. The Swede, who won 72 times on the LPGA Tour and triumphed in ten major championships, took on the men at a PGA Tour event back in 2003. Prior to the tournament, three-time major winner Vijay Singh said Sorenstam ""didn't belong"" at the tournament. She eventually shot four-over-par and missed the cut, but tied for first in driving accuracy during her first round. Vonn had previously told the New York Times: ""I'd like to have one chance in my life to race against them. Annika Sorenstam did it in golf and paved the way for women. I'm not asking for World Cup points. I just want the chance to compete."" Lee-Gartner says there are plenty of male competitors on the tour who support Vonn's desire but also some who joke she should be allowed to see how she gets on against them on the notoriously treacherous Kitzbuhel track in Austria. But, the FIS aside, there is almost total uniformity within the sport that skiing would benefit from the huge media interest any showdown would attract. ""The more I reflect on who she is, what she's done and how great it would be for this sport, in my opinion it is a marketing opportunity that FIS should be taking,"" Lee-Gartner added. ""I realise in Austria, Switzerland, alpine skiing is one of the premier sports they watch, they don't necessarily have an issue getting people interested in the sport. ""Anytime there's an athlete's presence and profile has surpassed the sport in that nation, which hers has in North America, I think we'd be crazy not to use that opportunity she's handing to us on a platter."" Vonn is already the most successful skier the United States has ever produced, and should she overtake Moser-Proll's record, only one person could claim to have more wins than her -- Sweden's male legend Ingemar Stenmark, on 86. Of Vonn's quest to cross the gender boundary, Hoedlmoser said: ""That's something she really wants, she sees it as the next level of ski racing. She wants to see how far up she is, that's the only goal. ""She can compete with them, it all depends on the snow preparation, what the conditions are. We have situations in training where she trains against men. She's never done it in a race situation and I think that's where she really wants to be."" Vonn is backed by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association and now seems determined to head down legal avenues to pursue her dream of sharing a slope with the men. Lee-Gartner added: ""I'm not sure if FIS will be able to say yes because they do things in a very old fashioned way. But she's a pioneer and for the first of anything it takes a little bit longer to break the barrier down.""","Skiing sensation Lindsey Vonn is considering legal action in her bid to race men .

"(CNN) -- From time to time, Sasha Raven Gross can be seen teetering around a neighborhood drinking hole. She flirts with strangers, talks gibberish and sometimes spins in circles for no apparent reason until she falls down. In one hand is her liquid of choice -- watered-down orange juice in a sippy cup. The 14-month-old toddler is the sort of barfly who's at the center of a recurring and heated debate: Should parents be allowed to bring their babies and children to bars? It is a question in Brooklyn, New York, that's fired up online arguments, prompted unofficial protests and made outsiders giggle. And while the issue may not be exclusive to that area, it's the stuff disputes are made of in what Sasha's dad, Matt Gross, calls the kid-heavy ""greater stroller zone"" of Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods. Single hipsters and others without (and sometimes with) kids complain about being asked to watch their language, to not smoke outdoors near strollers and to keep their drunk friends under control so as not to scare the little ones. They don't want to feel pressure to play peekaboo. They want to cry over their beers, they say, without having an infant drown them out. If anyone is spitting up, they want it to be them. ""I will get up on the subway for kids. I will be tolerant of them kicking the back of my seat while seeing a G-rated movie. But let me have my bars,"" said Julieanne Smolinski, 26, who feels guilty sucking down suds in front of staring 5-year-olds. The adults who bring their offspring to bars, she suggests, are ""clinging to their youth."" Parents, on the other hand, say that as long as they're responsible and their kids behave, they deserve the right to grab a quick drink with friends. And, they might add, in a place like New York -- where the cost of baby sitters can be prohibitive and tight living quarters can make hosting guests at home difficult -- they need places to hang out, too. ""As a stay-at-home dad, it can be kind of isolating. Bars, as much as they're places to drink, they're places to socialize and meet people,"" said Gross, 35, a freelance writer, an editor for the blog DadWagon and the columnist behind the Frugal Traveler in The New York Times. ""I long for adult contact. ... I don't want to be excluded from the adult world."" But the divide remains wide in the blogosphere. Around 150 readers weighed in recently when someone posted on the Brooklynian, a neighborhood blog, the simple query: ""Which bars are child free?"" One writer shared the tale of a drunk father standing at a bar while his beer sloshed on his stroller-strapped kid's face. Another poster announced a bar crawl in which ""no crawlers"" would be allowed. The public debate about babies in bars ignited about two years ago when the bar Union Hall, a popular stomping ground, banned strollers from the premises, Gross said. ""At a certain point, owners said, 'Hey, enough,' "" he explained. ""Strollers take up a lot of room, especially the nice strollers. Your average Bugaboo is a beast."" This ban on buggies in a neighborhood where ""kids rule"" caused an ""uproar,"" said Erica Reitman, the 36-year-old married -- but not a ""breeder,"" she insists -- marketing director who is behind the blog F****ed in Park Slope. ""There wasn't a march on the street, but there could have been. [Union Hall] relented under pressure and got rid of the policy."" The owner of Union Hall would not talk to CNN, but an unnamed bartender -- who mentioned the bar had been issued tickets by the fire department at one point because strollers blocked exits -- confirmed that there is no such policy in place. In a part of the city where Greg Curley says he sees ""a sense of entitlement on both sides,"" and where people don't hold back their opinions -- ""This is Brooklyn,"" he said -- he and his partners at The Double Windsor instituted a no-kids-after-5 p.m. rule. ""We're a neighborhood gathering place, not a hard-drinking bar, and we're not jerks about it"" said Curley, a co-owner and the general manager. ""But the overwhelming clientele that spends quite a lot of money here can't deal with babies."" Rules like this, simple compromises, don't bother Gross as they might other parents. He's not interested in taking Sasha out till all hours of the night anyway. But when he gets a little stir-crazy in their apartment, he likes to head out to grab a stout with his little girl. He's not taking her to punk dive bars where the music is loud, fights break out and patrons make out or pass out. They gravitate to mellow hangouts, and only in the late afternoon or early evening. ""I'm not going to keep her out past 7 p.m. When the bar starts filling up, that's when we head home,"" he said. ""It's responsible parenting and responsible adult behavior. I'm not knocking back double vodkas while my daughter is stumbling around.""","Babies in bars are the subject of heated discussion in Brooklyn, where strollers rule .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama poked fun Saturday night at his chief of staff and ribbed Washington's elite during a black-tie dinner at Alfalfa Club, a 93-year-old Washington social club. Colin Powell chats with other guests at the Alfalfa dinner in Washington on Saturday night. The first African-American president began by poking fun at the club's historical roots. ""I know that many you are aware that this dinner began almost 100 years ago as a way to celebrate the birthday of General Robert E. Lee,"" Obama said, referring to the man who commanded the Confederate army during the Civil War. ""If he were here with us tonight, the general would be 202 years old. And very confused."" The ceremony was closed to the media. But the White House released excerpts of the president's remarks. The Alfalfa Club was started by four Southerners in Washington's Willard Hotel in 1913. Its sole purpose was an annual night out for the boys, and it took its name from a thirsty plant that sends its roots deep down looking for liquid refreshment. The club remained exclusively open to men until 1994, when women were admitted as members. Arizona Sen. John McCain, whom Obama defeated for the presidency, and McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, also attended the event. Obama saved most of his ribbing for his chief of staff, Rahm Emmanuel, who has a reputation for being quick to anger. ""Now, this hasn't been reported yet, but it was actually Rahm's idea to do the swearing-in ceremony again,"" he said. ""Of course, for Rahm, every day is a swearing-in ceremony."" On the president's first full day in office, Chief Justice John Roberts re-administered the oath of office to Obama after they flubbed during the inauguration.  Watch highlights of Obama's second week as president » . Obama said that in his first weeks as president, he has had to ""engage in some of the toughest diplomacy of my life."" ""And that was just to keep my BlackBerry,"" he said. ""I finally agreed to limit the number of people who could e-mail me. It's a very exclusive list. How exclusive? Everyone look at the person sitting on your left. Now look at the person sitting on your right.

"(CNN) -- If there's any truth in the old saw that London's streets are paved with gold, it's probably because they've been gilded by cash stripped from the pockets of tourists. It won't surprise anyone who's seen their budget evaporate seconds after exiting their over-priced hotel, but the English metropolis has been named the world's priciest city break destination. Review site TripAdvisor compared prices in 48 leading tourist destinations to conclude that London has overtaken Oslo as the world capital of the inadvertent splurge. According to the site's annual TripIndex Cities study, seven of the world's 10 most expensive destinations are in Europe. Asia fields the majority of the list's most affordable cities for a holiday. The list says an evening out and overnight stay in a four-star hotel in London will relieve visitors of $523 -- more than three times the cost of the same break in Hanoi, which is named as best value. Travelers to Paris should be warned against working up too much of thirst while pounding its boulevards -- the city is identified as the priciest place for pre-dinner cocktails. Two dry martinis there set drinkers back an average $52. Even then the cocktails will probably be watered down by the salty tears of whoever's footing the bill. New York still the place for expensive hotels . TripAdvisor's research reveals Stockholm is the costliest place for an evening meal. For the same money in Hanoi visitors can can pay for a four-star hotel, cab fare, cocktails, dinner for two and still have enough change to call Sweden and gloat. New York tops the list for expensive hotels for the second year running, with a night in a four-star hotel costing an average of $365 -- four times the price of the same deal in Bangkok. While Oslo may have lost out to London in the overall list, the Norwegian city still rules when it comes to taxi fares. There, a three-kilometer (1.9 mile) journey will set customers back $57. In Jakarta, the cheapest city, the same journey can be made for less than $3. Here's TripAdvisor's top 10 of most expensive cities: London, Paris, New York, Stockholm, Oslo, Zurich, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Toronto, Sydney.

"(CNN) -- Joseph Wood snorted and struggled to breathe during his nearly two-hour lethal injection Wednesday, his attorney said. ""It took Joseph Wood two hours to die, and he gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes. We will renew our efforts to get information about the manufacturer of drugs as well as how Arizona came up with the experimental formula of drugs it used today,"" attorney Dale Baich said in a statement. He added: ""Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror -- a bungled execution."" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer had directed the Department of Corrections to review the process, saying she is concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the lethal injection. A federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution. ""One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer. This is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims -- and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family,"" Brewer said. Arizona's corrections department said in a statement that it followed protocol in Wood's execution, re-affirming his ""deep sedation"" seven times before he was pronounced dead. Aside from snoring, he did not make grimaces or otherwise move, the corrections department said. Wood was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father. ""I don't believe he was gasping for air; I don't believe he was suffering. It sounded to me like was snoring,"" said Jeanne Brown, a relative of Wood's victims. ""You don't know what excruciating is. What's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn't really call him a man,"" she said. The execution procedure began at 1:52 p.m. (4:52 p.m. ET) and concluded, with Wood's being pronounced dead, at 3:49 p.m. (6:49 p.m. ET). Troy Hayden, a media witness from KSAZ, told reporters the execution was difficult to watch. He likened Wood's breathing to a ""fish gulping for air."" ""It was tough for everybody in that room,"" he said. Michael Kiefer, a reporter for The Arizona Republic, has witnessed five executions, including Wood's. ""Usually it takes about 10 minutes, the person goes to sleep. This was not that,"" he told reporters afterward. ""It started off looking as if it was going alright but then obviously something didn't go right. It took two hours."" Kiefer described the sound Wood made as a ""deep, snoring, sucking air sound."" Wood's attorneys had filed an emergency motion for a stay after his execution began, saying then that Wood had been ""gasping and snorting for more than an hour."" The motion read: ""He is still alive. This execution has violated Mr. Wood's Eighth Amendment right to be executed in the absence of cruel and unusual punishment. We respectfully request that this Court stop the execution and require that the Department of Corrections use the lifesaving provisions required in its protocol."" Inmate objected to drugs . Earlier, the Arizona Supreme Court lifted its brief stay of the murderer's execution. Wood was first set to be executed at 10 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET), though it was temporarily halted when the court said it would consider his request for the justices to review his claims. The court lifted the stay shortly after that, saying without explanation that it considered the request but decided not to review Wood's case. Wood was the latest American death row inmate to argue that an anesthetic recently introduced in some states' execution protocols could fail to sufficiently knock out the inmate ahead of the lethal drugs, subjecting the person to an agonizing death. Opinion: 5 ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . Wood claimed among other things that the state was going to use an ""experimental"" drug protocol of midazolam and hydromorphone. In documents filed with the state Supreme Court, he contended the use of the anesthetic midazolam was problematic in recent U.S. executions and that it would violate the Constitution's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. Wood was ""very concerned they were experimenting,"" said attorney Baich, who witnessed the execution. ""The room was silent. I was focusing on Mr. Wood. There were seven announcements during the process that Mr. Wood was still sedated. This is -- to confirm that he was still sedated. ""He was still breathing and struggling to breathe and gasping and snorting. I have witnessed 10 executions, and I had never seen that before,"" Baich told CNN. Opinion: I was 17, on death row -- and innocent . Controversial Oklahoma execution . Drugs weren't Wood's only contention. He also argued the execution should be stopped because his trial attorney was ineffective and that new evaluations from psychologists show he has cognitive impairments that would make him innocent of premeditated murder. Some states turned to midazolam this decade after they could no longer get sodium thiopental, a drug that was regularly used for executions. A U.S. manufacturer stopped producing sodium thiopental in 2009, and countries that still produce it won't allow its export to the United States for use in lethal injections. Earlier this year, Oklahoma put executions on hold after the controversial execution of Clayton Lockett. Midazolam was part of the injection combination, and it took 43 minutes for him to die, Oklahoma officials said. While state officials said Lockett was unconscious the entire time, a media witness for CNN affiliate KFOR said he uttered the words, ""Man,"" ""I'm not,"" and ""something's wrong,"" before blinds to the execution chamber were closed. His lawyer, Dean Sanderford, said the inmate's body twitched and convulsed before he died. Oklahoma's Department of Public Safety, acting on orders from Gov. Mary Fallin to get to the bottom of what happened, is investigating whether prison officials followed protocols. The review is also supposed to include recommendations about how to prevent something similar from happening again. ""It's time for Arizona and the other states still using lethal injection to admit that this experiment with unreliable drugs is a failure,"" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. ""Instead of hiding lethal injection under layers of foolish secrecy, these states need to show us where the drugs are come from. Until they can give assurances that the drugs will work as intended, they must stop future executions,"" it read. Mississippi mom swaps death row for jail cell to await trial .

"(CNN) -- Your friends don't need to know about every song you hear on the radio.

Pandora, which makes the popular personalized Internet radio service, isn't just concerned about clutter in your Facebook friends' news feeds. Some listeners could feel violated when they learn that an application is broadcasting information about their activities, Pandora executives said. ""It's true that music is a social experience, but it's also a very private experience,"" Pandora founder Tim Westergren said in a recent phone interview. ""We have to be very cautious."" Facebook is poised to release new features at a news conference on Wednesday that will allow users to automatically publish information from other websites and apps to their Timeline profiles, according to a person familiar with the project. These will go beyond the Facebook Music app that's already available, the person said. For example, a fitness program that tracks physical activities could send Facebook an update after a long jog. The plans were reported earlier by the website All Things Digital. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. At a news conference in September, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said people would benefit from publishing more data and letting computer algorithms sort out what's important. ""No activity is too big or too small to share,"" Zuckerberg said. ""You don't have to 'Like' a movie. You just watch a movie."" Facebook will press on without the support of some major app makers, such as Apple, whose iTunes software is the No. 1 digital jukebox. An Apple spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Flipboard, an app that creates personalized magazines from social network feeds, has said the company doesn't plan to send information to Facebook about every article users read and will instead let users selectively post with a share button. She said people probably wouldn't want to broadcast everything. Pandora has supported many of Facebook's platform development efforts in the past. Pandora launched Facebook sharing features when they were first rolled out and was among the first to support Facebook's Instant Personalization program, which automatically recognizes a Pandora visitor's Facebook account. ""We have a great relationship with Facebook,"" a Pandora spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. ""We continue to be excited about what they are doing and more generally about the social dimension of music -- for example, there are a host of great new social features on the new Pandora.com site that we launched in September."" Pandora's feed can be tweaked or edited by each user, but only includes information when a user creates a new radio station or bookmarks or clicks the thumbs-up button on a particular song or artist. It doesn't post a feed of every song that plays. Facebook lets users manage which apps can publish to their profiles using a page called the Activity Log. In an interview with reporters in September, Facebook CTO Bret Taylor said the company's long-term goal is to have every app support the auto-publish features. Earlier partners have said that the tools have brought in hordes of newcomers to their websites. Pandora is one of many that is reluctant to sign on, but its absence from Facebook Music is noticeable. ""There is a segment for sure that wants to really promiscuously share and wants to hear about everything that their friends are listening to,"" Pandora CTO Tom Conrad told a small audience at a technology conference recently. However, they make up a minority, he said. ""There is a really large percentage of the Pandora audience that actually aren't interested at all in what their friends are listening to,"" Conrad said. ""They don't want to spam their entire social network with things they're discovering.""","Pandora does not plan to support Facebook Music and its auto-publish features .

"(CNN) -- The Chinese government is bracing itself for a rush of people wishing to marry when the summer Olympics kick off on August 8 -- because the number carries a special significance in Chinese culture, the state news agency said Sunday. A traditional Ming-style wedding is held in Nanjing, China, last December. The number ""eight"" (ba) is considered auspicious by many in China because it sounds like the word for ""wealth"" and ""fortune,"" the news agency Xinhua said. ""We've long been prepared for a stampede of newly-wed couples this year,"" Guo Xusheng, spokesman with the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, told Xinhua. Every year, many couples choose the 8th of August -- the eighth month of the year -- hoping ""eighth of the eighth"" luck will rub off on them, the news agency said. Nearly 3,400 couples got hitched on the day last year, some waiting all night outside the marriage registration office in Beijing. This year, the civil affairs bureau is accepting online reservations for marriage registrations for the day. The significance that numbers carry in Chinese culture often dictate various aspects of the people's lives there. And of all the numbers, eight is considered one of the luckiest.

"(CNN) -- How do you get a foot on the property ladder, when you live in one of the most expensive cities in the world? For an increasing number of first-time home buyers like Sandra Reddin, the answer doesn't lie on land -- but in the water. ""Doing the washing-up with swans floating by your window -- I love it,"" says the 55-year-old, who bought a houseboat earlier this year. In a city where $1 million will buy you a mere 25 square meters in prime central real estate, Londoners are turning to the labyrinth of waterways silently snaking their way through the metropolis. Centuries ago, these gently rippling canals were used to transport cargo -- a floating highway bustling with barges and connecting towns across the country. Now the narrowboats which heaved goods up and down the UK have become homes for those struggling to get a foothold in the third most expensive real estate market on the planet. While a house in Narrow Boat Close, a street in leafy south-east London, will set you back an average $350,000, an actual narrowboat costs around a quarter of the amount. Those looking to take the plunge can expect to pay anywhere between $3,000 and $250,000 for a canal boat in the English capital -- and it's not the only European city utilizing its waterways. With Paris property prices rivaling that of London, houseboats along the Seine may be a more affordable option for those determined to reside within eyesight of the Eiffel Tower. In nearby Amsterdam, pavement life spills onto the intricate network of canals, home not just to residential boats, but a huge array of hotel vessels, and the world's only floating flower market. Canal costs . But is life afloat really as financially attractive as it seems? Alan Wildman, of the UK's Residential Boat Owners' Association, pours cold water on the idea. ""People move on board thinking it's a way to get on the housing ladder -- which is absolute nonsense,"" says the 64-year-old, who lives on a narrowboat with his wife. ""It can be cheaper than living in a house. But when you consider all the other components of life afloat that go with it ... people can very quickly become disenchanted."" Long-term moorings in London can be over $30,000 a year -- ""and that's just for somewhere to hang your boat,"" adds Wildman. Unlike real estate, houseboats decrease in value, he said. If you're thinking of taking the plunge, it has to be for love -- not money. River romance . That said, stepping aboard Reddin's elegant 13-meter houseboat ""Happy Days,"" it's easy to see the allure of life on the river. Inside, the wooden vessel is bigger than you'd expect, boasting a wood fire, fully kitted-out bathroom, kitchen, and double bedroom. A golden afternoon light bounces off the water, streaming in through the long narrow windows. Though relatively roomy, I still manage to knock my head on the low door, ungracefully exiting onto the decking for a sunset sip of wine. ""It's a very neat little operation,"" says Reddin, nodding towards the compact home, where everything has its place. The photographer bought her $124,000 boat a few months ago, seeing it as an affordable way to live in the heart of the city, while constantly change the view out her window. It now bobs in desirable north London's Regent's Canal, an area where waterfront properties regularly have million-dollar price tags. The mother-of-two was paying $3,000 a month to rent an apartment in another part of north London when she decided to give it up for life on the water. ""You've got all these different noises,"" she says. ""Little ducks landing on your roof, the lapping of the water, and when it rains, it's just amazing."" Tough love . Reddin is under no illusions that boat-living isn't all smooth sailing -- particularly come winter. ""I'm quite a gung-ho, intrepid type. I think you need to be for this lifestyle,"" she says. Wildman offers a reality check: ""Imagine you're out on the canal and you're iced in, and your toilet tank is getting full, and you've got to cruise half a mile to get to a pumping-out point. ""You've got to take the rough with the smooth."" If you want to live on board, you also need to be prepared to cut out any excess, says Nathan Rogers, manager of dealership NarrowboatShop.co.uk. ""You have to be disciplined in terms of your living space and how you utilize it,"" he warns. ""But this also leads to a streamlining and simplification of everyday life."" Close quarters . In such a confined space, is it possible to bring up a brood of scampering children? ""It means you have to get on with each other,"" says Wildman, who has seen many families happily grow up on the water. ""If you've got to get children to school, you need a continuous mooring permit,"" he adds, which is more expensive than current regulations requiring owners to move every two weeks. There are around 30,000 to 40,000 people living on boats in the UK, estimates Wildman. He describes a tight-knit floating community where neighbors look out for each other. ""It's very much like old England,"" he says. Though in modern times, people are getting on board for very different reasons. Learn: Size matters -- how big is your yacht?

"(CNN) -- Two tornadoes ripped into a New Orleans suburb Wednesday afternoon, damaging homes and knocking down power lines, but no injuries were reported, the National Weather Service and local authorities said.

"A Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy in Pakistan plans to take her case to the country's highest court after a high court last week rejected her appeal, her attorney says. Asia Bibi, a mother of five from Punjab province, was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during a 2009 argument with Muslim fellow field workers. The workers had refused to drink from a bucket of water she had touched because she was not Muslim. In November 2010, a Pakistani district court  found Bibi guilty of blasphemy. The offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code, and Bibi was sentenced to hang. On October 16, the Lahore High Court upheld the verdict. Human Rights Watch described the court's decision as a ""disgrace to Pakistan's judiciary."" ""Asia Bibi's case is an example of how Pakistan's vaguely worded blasphemy law has led to discrimination, persecution and murder since its imposition almost three decades ago,"" spokesman Phelim Kine told CNN. Bibi's attorney, Naeem Shakir, told CNN on Monday that he would file an appeal once he had received a detailed copy of the judgment. ""I have a very strong case, I am sure the Supreme Court will provide us with relief. There is no concrete evidence against Asia Bibi, and the courts are only relying on the statement on those two women,"" Shakir said. Blasphemy allegations . At a 2010 media conference, Bibi said the allegations against her were lies fabricated by a group of women who didn't like her. ""We had some differences, and this was their way of taking revenge,"" she said. An investigation by Shahbaz Bhatti, who was then Pakistan's minister for minority affairs, also found the charges stemmed from religious and personal enmity, and he recommended Bibi's release. Bhatti was the only Christian member of the Cabinet in Pakistan, where 95% of people are Muslim, and had opposed the blasphemy law. In 2011, he was assassinated in Islamabad. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility, saying the killing was ""a message to all of those who are against Pakistan's blasphemy laws."" Two months earlier, the governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, had been shot dead by his security guard because he, too, had supported Bibi and spoken out against the law. Court reaction . Speaking Monday after last week's verdict, Shakir admitted also feeling that his life was in danger. ""I do feel threatened. Even in the court, there were some two dozen people who were against Asia Bibi. I have not received any threats literally, but the presence of people there makes the environment very hostile toward us,"" he told CNN. Those calling for Bibi's execution welcomed the court's ruling, Shakir said: ""Some of them were so overjoyed and happy that they started crying in delight on hearing the decision of the court."" Qari Saleem, one of the clerics pursuing the case, told CNN via phone that Bibi deserved the punishment. ""I am very happy at the decision of the court, and justice has been done,"" Saleem said, adding that sweets had been distributed in court after the ruling ""out of joy and happiness."" Human rights groups' reaction . Initial news of Bibi's death sentence sparked outrage among international human rights groups, which condemned Pakistan's blasphemy law as a source of violence and persecution against religious minorities. Human Rights Watch's Kine said the law largely targeted religious minorities  and was ""all too often manipulated to seek personal disputes."" ""Pakistan's Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif should use the power granted to him under Pakistan's Constitution to end Asia Bibi's nightmare of years of imprisonment and the threat of a death sentence by pardoning her and repealing or reforming the country's blasphemy law to prevent such tragic mockeries of justice from occurring in (the) future,"" he said. Amnesty International last week described the decision as ""a grave injustice."" ""Asia Bibi should never have been convicted in the first place -- still less sentenced to death -- and the fact that she could pay with her life for an argument is sickening,"" an Amnesty spokesman said. In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI called for Bibi to be released, and in 2012, activists presented a petition to the U.N. Human Rights Council calling on Pakistan to free her. Bibi wrote about her ordeal in a 2012 book called ""Get Me Out of Here."" It includes a letter she wrote to her family urging them to have faith in God. ""My children,"" she wrote, ""don't lose courage or faith in Jesus Christ.""","Human Rights Watch describes latest ruling as a ""disgrace to Pakistan's judiciary""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll continues to rise from devastating flooding in southeastern Pakistan, with authorities saying Friday that 107 children are among the 434 people killed. Roughly 660,000 people are living in refugee camps in the wake of high waters that have wrought havoc for several weeks, Pakistan's national disaster authority said in a statement. This is fewer than the 700,000 reported by the same agency just over a week ago. About 8.9 million people have been affected by the floods, which have destroyed 1.5 million homes in 37,000 villages in Sindh province alone, according to the statement. This marks the second straight year that Pakistan has seen deadly flooding. In August 2010, more than 20 million people were displaced and 1,700 people killed. The latest disaster has lasted longer than a month and caused an estimated $9.7 billion in damage to homes, roads and farms. The United Nations warned Friday that humanitarian aid is running out in the hard-hit region. This comes two weeks after the international organization and its partners launched an effort to raise $357 million to help those most affected -- of which only $19 million has been received, the U.N. said on its website. Safe drinking water and emergency shelter materials could run out within weeks, while agencies on the ground have enough food for a month for the hundreds of thousands affected. ""It is tragic to see families displaced from the floods with no shelter and barely enough to survive on,"" said Fawad Hussein, a U.N. official focused on flood relief. ""These families worry their children will go hungry, and without access to safe drinking water, they fear they will become sick from drinking contaminated water.""","107 of the 434 killed in the flooding are children, the government says .

"Foss Lake, Oklahoma (CNN) -- It began as routine training with new sonar equipment on an Oklahoma lake. But what highway patrolmen found from their boat was macabre. It was a car. And, as they were to discover later, there were bones and skulls inside. Then, equally surprising, they found another car. And it had bones inside it, too. Rusted and caked with mud, a 1952 Chevrolet and a 1969 Chevrolet Camaro held as many as six bodies. The recovery of the vehicles and remains Tuesday have residents near Foss Lake, a reservoir about 110 miles west of Oklahoma City, wondering whether two mysteries -- involving disappearances that the town of Sayre never forgot -- can finally be put to rest. Investigators say they believe one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970, and the other car could be linked to the disappearance of a man in the 1960s who a federal official says was with a sibling and a friend, officials told CNN and its affiliates KFOR and KOCO. Darrell Splawn, a diver with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, was sent down on Tuesday, one week after the sonar located the corroding vehicles. They were right next to each other, at a depth of 12 feet and 50 feet from a marina. Visibility was almost nil. He, like others, had no idea how the vehicles -- which faced in different directions -- came to be in the lake. Splawn located an open door and felt a shoe. ""It didn't really cross my mind as to a body being there. It could have just been a shoe,"" the trooper told CNN on Wednesday. Skeletal remains were seen when the car was brought to shore. Now authorities are trying to positively identify the remains, a process that could take years, and try to learn what happened. So much time has passed in the two cases that the son of one missing person is now 85 and struggling with dementia. Young motorist was supposed to go to football game . Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples told KOCO that one of the cars, the Camaro, may have belonged to 16-year-old Jimmy Williams, a Sayre teenager who disappeared in 1970 with two friends: Thomas Rios and Leah Johnson, both 18. Rios had just moved to Sayre from Oklahoma City with his mother and stepfather about four months before his disappearance, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System website said. The three teenagers went missing the night of November 20, 1970, when they went for a ride around Sayre in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization helping law enforcement in solving cold cases. Williams was supposed to be going to a football game in Elk City, but he may have instead gone hunting on a road called Turkey Creek with Rios and Johnson, the Doe Network website said. The website includes photos of the Camaro and cites Williams' family as its source of information. The three teens never returned home. The car was never found, and its vehicle identification number never surfaced on any databases. Williams' Social Security number was never used, the Doe Network said. Sayre residents were horrified after the disappearances and held a candlelight vigil for the teens as recently as four years ago. ""A lot of people showed up, and it brought awareness,"" said Dayva Spitzer, co-editor and publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat weekly newspaper. ""It was very nicely done."" Police Chief Ronnie Harrold told CNN that local residents have been making up their own theories about what became of the three teens for the 26 years he's been there. A grandfather disappears and leaves no trace . Debbie McManaman said she believes the older car contains the remains of her grandfather, John Alva Porter. Porter, then 69, was traveling in a green Chevy with a sibling, Alrie Porter, and friend Nora Marie Duncan, 58, on April 8, 1969, when they all went missing, said Mike Nance, regional system administrator for the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. ""It's been so long -- 44 years. There are a lot of things in between there we can't answer, because we don't know,"" McManaman told CNN on Wednesday. ""His bank account was there, his house was locked up. Utilities were on. He just walked away."" John Porter used to ride bulls and take part in Wild West shows. At the lake, Ervie Porter, the son of John Porter, watched as investigators crawled around the cars. Now 85, the younger Porter suffers from dementia. He told CNN he has spent a long time searching for his father. ""Still looking for him. But this is going to help me a whole lot."" Divers search in, around vehicles . After the two cars were pulled out, dive teams with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol scoured the lake bottom again. ""The divers then went back in the water and searched around,"" said spokeswoman Betsy Randolph, ""and found a skull."" Splawn said he found a skull, femur and some smaller bones during the additional search. ""This is the first time this has ever happened to me,"" he said. After thorough searches, both vehicles were towed away Wednesday evening. Trooper George Hoyle was operating the sonar equipment that last week spotted the two vehicles. Foss Lake is down substantially because of a drought and that could have been a factor in the discovery, officials said. Hoyle said he hopes families now will receive answers. ""It feels very good to us to be able to help them get that closure so they can have some resolve and serenity in their own lives,"" he said. Taken: The oldest cold case ever solved . Identification of remains will take time . The Oklahoma chief medical examiner's office will examine the remains once they are removed from the vehicles and ""will possibly try to match DNA of those remains with known surviving family members,"" a Custer County Sheriff's Office statement said. The remains will be first evaluated by using any identification cards, jewelry and teeth found on the bodies, said Chief Medical Examiner Eric Pfeifer. A muddied wallet, a purse and two corroded rifles were among the items recovered. Authorities cautioned Wednesday, however, that positive identification could take years. The state anthropologist, Angela Berg, will examine the remains. ""Scientific identification of these remains will be attempted using anthropological and if necessary, forensic pathological methods,"" Chief Administrative Officer Amy Elliott said in a written statement. ""Depending on the features of these remains and their state of preservation, identification can take anywhere from days to years. In some cases, if the DNA is degraded, positive identification using scientific means may not be possible. Evidence in killing of former beauty queen points to ex-priest . In December, state anthropologist Berg coincidentally began looking into the cold case of the Porters and Duncan and then contacted Nance after she discovered that another cold case existed about a second vehicle with three missing teens in the same area, Nance told CNN. When authorities discovered the two cars and remains of six people, Berg called Nance for information on the six missing persons, which the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System maintains, he said. NAMUS recently coordinated with law agencies the collection of DNA from the family of Duncan, the woman who went missing along with the Porters, and the federal agency posted her name on its website, Nance said. A topic of discussion, speculation since 1970 . Sayre, a town of about 4,000 residents, largely depends on gas, oil and agriculture. A prison with about 2,400 beds is just outside of town, which is in Beckham County. Foss Lake is in adjoining Custer County. Three or four sheriffs have tried to solve the 1970 disappearance of the teens, said Spitzer, the newspaper editor. ""It was just a cold case that ran out of clues,"" she said. ""There were no leads or clues."" Jimmy Williams worked at a mom-and-pop grocery store, and everyone expected him to return to work the day after he disappeared, said Spitzer. ""There are theories from A to Z, literally. Most people think they ran into bad guys, somebody who apprehended them or something."" Williams' brother, Gary, told a KFOR reporter that he felt positive that his brother's body has been found and that the discovery was made in God's timing, after so many local prayers. ""To the family, it is fresh to them, opening wounds,"" said Spitzer. ""For Sayre, it is at least some closure."" Four females brought back to life by new images, DNA tests .

"Washington (CNN) -- A group that's working to keep Democrats in control of the Senate is releasing its first television ad in the contested U.S. Senate race in Alaska between incumbent Sen. Mark Begich and his GOP challenger, Dan Sullivan. The ""multi-million dollar"" ad buy from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee comes as Begich's campaign faces a slew of negative headlines for releasing a political attack ad that focused on a gruesome 2013 murder and sexual assault case. The DSCC said it was already planning to go up with the new 30-second spot before the recent controversy, and the ad doesn't mention Begich's ad. Rather, it hits Dan Sullivan for opposing Obamacare. In the commercial, an elderly woman whose husband has Alzheimer's disease says Sullivan ""supports a plan"" to slash Medicare benefits, and his policies would raise prescription drug costs. In the commercial, an elderly woman whose husband has Alzheimer's disease says Sullivan ""supports a plan"" to slash Medicare benefits, and his policies would raise prescription drug costs. Fact Check: Would repeal of Obamacare hike seniors' drug costs? According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Alaska has the largest growth rate for seniors (age 65 and older); the population for that age group increased by 54% between 2000 and 2010. The ad also hits Sullivan for saying he's open to raising the minimum age for Social Security eligibility. While Sullivan has advocated for reform for younger generations, he has said ""we're not going to touch"" benefits for seniors who are either receiving Social Security benefits or about to receive them. ""But with the younger generation, to phase in reform, there is opportunity,"" he said last month at the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce GOP debate. CNN rates the race between Sullivan and Begich as one of six toss-up contests in this year's midterm elections. As a Democratic senator in a reliably red state, Begich is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to retake the majority in the Senate. The DSCC also has spent money on ads in Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Iowa, Colorado and Michigan. The new spot comes as Begich is under hot water after his campaign went up with a Willie Horton-style ad against Sullivan on Friday. The spot accused Sullivan of being soft on crime, focusing on a case in which a man allegedly murdered an elderly couple last year and sexually assaulted the couple's granddaughter, as well as another elderly woman in the home. At the time of the crime, the suspect had just finished a prison sentence of four years for another crime. His sentence should have been longer because his record included a separate felony, but he was only sentenced to four years because of a mistake by the state. Because Sullivan was serving as attorney general at the time of the suspect's sentencing in 2010, Begich's campaign tried to fault Sullivan for letting the suspect go early. However, the mistake that led to the short sentence was made before Sullivan became attorney general. Politifact gave the ad a ""Pants on fire"" rating, saying the ad ""is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation."" Shortly after the spot aired, the victims' family called on Begich and Sullivan, who had released his own ad countering the claims, to pull down their spots, saying the publicity could affect the jury pool for the trial scheduled for this month. Sullivan's campaign asked TV stations to stop running the ad Sunday, while Begich's team first said it would alter the ad to remove references to the case. The campaign later pulled down the ad altogether.","The DSCC is spending money against the GOP challenger in Alaska's Senate race .

"(CNN) -- For the last decade, Carolyn LeCroy has been helping children stay connected to their incarcerated parents through video messages. LeCroy was honored as a CNN Hero in 2008, and has since expanded her Messages Project to prisons in five states. Her story inspired actress Holly Robinson Peete, who recently joined LeCroy on a visit to a maximum security prison. CNN's Anderson Cooper spoke with Peete about her experience. Anderson Cooper: What was it about Carolyn's efforts that first sparked your interest? Holly Robinson Peete: I learned about a subset of the population that I never thought of before, which are the children of incarcerated parents. There was something about how hard of a sell it is; anytime you are talking about inmates or people in prison, people automatically -- there's some pushback. But with Carolyn's brand of philanthropy, I just found myself intrigued, and I had to help her out. Read the 2008 story: Ex-con's videos keep inmates, kids in touch . Cooper: How does the Messages Project work? Peete: The Messages Project goes into prisons across the country and films messages of incarcerated parents who are either reading a book, a bedtime story, giving a very positive message, giving love to the caregiver watching these children. Something so simple you would think wouldn't be a big deal, but to a child who's lost their parent to incarceration, they watch these videos over and over again. It has a really positive effect on them. So many times, a lot of these children end up in prisons themselves, and this is something that might be able to stop that chain. I think about watching my father's video. My father's been deceased for many years. When he was at my wedding, he just said, ""I love you."" I watch it over and over and over again, and it just lifts me up. To these children, these are not hardened criminals. Oftentimes they are just looked at as Mommy or Daddy. So, it's very important that the children know it's not their fault and that they know they're loved. More: CNN Heroes . Cooper: How did you get involved with the program? Peete: I met Carolyn in 2008 and we've been trying to get together. ... The Messages Project is now in Oklahoma, in Nebraska, in Virginia. And we kept talking about California. It's the most incarcerated state in the country. And that's where I live. So I said, ""We've got to get in there."" And we finally made it in. It ... was a lot of pressure; I wanted it to go well. Cooper: What did that day involve? Peete: It involved me driving for hours and hours and hours to the middle of the desert, to the middle of nowhere California. ... It involved meeting five inmates who, most of them, may never come out of that prison. And they really didn't strike me as people who had done anything except that they were dads in that moment and they wanted to get messages to their children. Cooper: What's it like seeing someone who is incarcerated and you know why they are there, and yet you see them in kind of a different light when they are trying to get a message to their child? Peete: Apparently these are hardened criminals, people who are doing time for very, very serious offenses, often murder and armed robbery. I personally didn't want to know until I left what they did. I just wanted to appeal to them as a mom and as a parent. I think we don't think about the impact of what the children of incarcerated parents have to go through. Sometimes their parents are just yanked, right in front of their eyes in some very difficult situations with policemen and guns. So, it's a mind-boggling situation for children, and these tiny messages are so impactful. Cooper: It's an incredibly intimate act, the making of these videos. Peete: Even being there and watching some of these men, I was moved to tears because I saw how gut-wrenching it was for them to say, ""I'm sorry. This is not your fault. Daddy loves you and I just want you to be the best person you can be."" Those little anecdotal things sound very clichÃ©. We take it for granted if we've got a parent in the home, but hearing that for a child can make all the difference in the world. I felt like I was doing something not necessarily for the inmates, but for their children. I was impacted by it for the rest of the day, and still am. Cooper: You were recognized by a couple of the prisoners. What was that like? Peete: We walked into the cell block, and ... two gentlemen that came out looked at me. One of them said, ""Hey, Holly. What's going on? Remember you met me in Vancouver, and it was 1980. You were shooting '21 Jump Street.'"" He said, ""I've been trying to get a script to your agent."" ... (laughs) Even in jail somebody has a script for you, Anderson. ... I was just very blown away at his resourcefulness, because sure enough, three days later my agent said, ""Did you meet a screenwriter in jail?"" Cooper: What is it about the CNN Heroes project that really caught your interest? Peete: I'm a CNN Heroes groupie. ... The Heroes just use whatever it is that is at their disposal, and I'm always blown away by what they are able to accomplish with so little. And for no other reason than it is their calling, it is something they are drawn to.","Program keeps kids connected with their parents in prison .

"Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina (CNN) -- Weakening by the hour but still covering a massive area, Hurricane Earl spun off the North Carolina on Thursday night, lashing parts of the Outer Banks with rain and high wind. People along the East Coast made just-in-case preparations despite the waning power of the storm. The hurricane has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm, the National Hurricane Center said Thursday night, but warned that ""Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks"" of North Carolina. Hurricane warnings and watches stretched from North Carolina to Delaware and into Massachusetts, where a hurricane warning was issued for Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the surrounding area. A hurricane watch was also issued for the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect for most other coastal areas between North Carolina and Nova Scotia. iReport: Share your images and information . As of 8 p.m., the center of Earl was about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and about 625 miles (1,005 kilometers) south-southwest of Nantucket. It was heading north at about 18 mph (30 kph). A tropical storm warning is now in effect for the coast of Massachusetts from north of Hull to the Merrimack River, and for the coast of Maine from Stonington to Eastport. The tropical storm warning from Cape Fear to west of Surf City, North Carolina, has been discontinued. The storm, which had been a Category 3 until Thursday night, has maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (168 kph), the Hurricane Center reported just before 11 p.m. ET. Further weakening is expected overnight, forecasters said, but ""Earl is expected to remain a large and strong hurricane as it passes near the Outer Banks."" Two more tropical systems are in the Atlantic -- Fiona and Gaston. Fiona is on track for Bermuda, and as of Thursday afternoon, Gaston wasn't threatening any land. Read more on Gaston and Fiona . But for now, all eyes are on Earl. President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for North Carolina on Wednesday evening. The action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts and makes federal funds available. Maryland's governor issued an emergency declaration earlier in the day. The monster storm is forecast to pass close to the Outer Banks on Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said. ""Even if the center of Earl remains offshore ... hurricane force winds are expected to occur in the Outer Banks overnight tonight,"" the center said in its 8 p.m. Thursday forecast. The storm is expected to take aim at southeastern New England on Friday night. ""Hurricane force winds are expected within the Hurricane warning area in Massachusetts Friday night,"" the center said Thursday. Officials in Dare County, North Carolina, issued mandatory evacuation orders Thursday for visitors to the coastal county, including the Outer Banks. The mandatory evacuation extended to residents in some areas, including the town of South Nags Head and Hatteras Island. Dare County schools and courts were closed Thursday and will be closed Friday. Earl concerns homeowners along coast . ""Early this evening Hatteras Island will begin feeling the impact of Hurricane Earl's approach,"" the county said in a statement Thursday evening. ""Throughout the evening, weather conditions will progressively deteriorate ... until the storm leaves the area around daybreak Friday morning."" ""Hurricane Earl will produce high seas, ocean overwash, dangerous rip currents, and strong winds,"" it said. On Thursday night, Dare County Manager Bobby Outten told CNN that ""evacuations went well."" ""We got everybody off Hatteras [Wednesday],"" he said, referring to one coastal island. In other nearby areas, Outten said, ""I'm sure there are people holding out."" ""Residents of Dare County have been through this many times,"" the county's emergency response coordinator, Warren Judge, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""And they have their own individual practices and procedures to get their homes and businesses secured and prepared for the oncoming storm. What we need to happen now is for the visitors to heed the warning, to evacuate."" Earl is a large storm, meaning effects will be widely felt even if it does not make a direct hit. It covers about 166,000 square miles -- larger than California, which covers just under 160,000 square miles. The storm's outflow, or the clouds associated with it, could stretch from one end of the state of Texas to the other, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. The North Carolina coast should begin experiencing tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph by Thursday evening, forecasters said, with hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph arriving later. Local coverage by CNN affiliate WECT . ""Conditions are going to deteriorate rapidly,"" FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said Thursday, and people should not be lulled into thinking Earl is going to miss them. ""We have teams in all coastal states ready to support (governors) all the way up the New England States,"" Fugate told CNN Thursday night, describing FEMA's standby teams. ""We're not going to wait till things get bad."" Large breaking waves of 10 to 15 feet are possible along the coast, with possible storm surge of 2 to 4 feet and 3 to 4 inches of rainfall, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Isolated tornadoes and waterspouts are possible. The National Hurricane Center said those in the hurricane warning area -- coastal North Carolina from Bogue Inlet up to the Virginia state line, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds -- could see storm surge of 3 to 5 feet. However, the most severe part of Earl is expected to remain offshore, which might mean a lower storm surge, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""The fact that it happens overnight always gives us cause for concern,"" Judge said. ""But we're going to get a glancing blow."" He said he hoped the storm will not deal a direct hit to the area and will pass through quickly. ""This is my first hurricane and I'm looking forward to it, "" said Sarah Baker, a native of Oklahoma who works for a vacation rental company in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. ""The locals have been really nice, telling me what I needed to buy to get ready."" Rip currents and stormy seas were reported all the way up the East Coast, from Florida to Maine. Earl will make its closest pass to New Jersey on Friday afternoon, Morris said. It is expected to make its closest pass to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Friday night as a Category 1 hurricane. Tourist towns on Cape see effects from Earl . The long duration of tropical-storm-force winds threatens widespread power outages in parts of the South and the mid-Atlantic region, he said. Earl is expected to make a direct landfall over southern Nova Scotia on Saturday morning as a strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm will turn northeast as it collides with a cold front, said National Hurricane Center director Bill Read. But the hurricane was undergoing a phenomenon known as eyewall replacement, in which the existing eyewall weakens and a new one forms. That means the eye likely will grow in diameter and the storm will grow even larger as hurricane force winds stretch farther out, he said. Several airlines said Wednesday that passengers to and from cities along the Eastern Seaboard, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Bangor, Maine, could reschedule travel in coming days without penalty. Though they have not announced cancellations, Air Tran, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta said they would waive reschedule fees for such travelers. North Carolina Gov. Bev Purdue urged residents and visitors to prepare for the storm and heed evacuation orders. Indeed, some people were stocking up on food at grocery stores and attaching plywood to windows and doors of coastal homes. However, others thumbed their noses at Earl, set to arrive just ahead of the Labor Day holiday, and said they were staying put. ""We're from Michigan, so we're used to storms,"" one man said. ""But this is our first hurricane, so we're kind of excited about it and hope everything goes well."" ""I got three bottles of wine hidden in there,"" another man said, gesturing toward his grocery bags. ""The kids are good with the milk."" He said Earl ""might ruin some beach time ... looks like it's OK, but we'll keep an eye on the TV."" One sign on the Outer Banks warned, ""Earl, you are not welcome here."" CNN's Angela Fritz and Randy Harber contributed to this report.","NEW: Just before 11 p.m. ET, sustained winds reported at 105 mph .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A nurse who administered propofol to Michael Jackson more than a dozen times said the pop star did not appear to be a drug-seeker. David Fournier was called as a witness Thursday by AEG Live in an effort to convince jurors that Jackson was so deceptive and secretive about his drug use that its executives had no way of knowing his health was in danger as he prepared for his comeback concerts. An economist hired by the concert promoter's lawyers will testify Friday in an effort to downplay how much money Jackson might have earned had he not died at age 50 -- an important issue if the jury decides AEG Live is liable in his death. Michael Jackson's mother and three children contend the company negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death -- which the coroner ruled was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol. AEG Live argues that Jackson chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray, who told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. Fournier, a certified nurse anesthetist, testified about an incident on June 3, 2003 in which Jackson stopped breathing while under sedation for a procedure with Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. After Jackson suffered a ""somewhat bizarre reaction"" during the sedation, Klein told Fournier it might be because the singer had an ""opioid antagonist"" implant. It was intended to help treat a dependence on Demerol, he said. ""You expect your clients and doctors be honest with you and I felt ambushed and was upset,"" Fournier testified. The nurse said it made him angry at both Klein and Jackson. AEG Live lawyers hope jurors see the incident as evidence that Jackson was dishonest about his drug use, which would support their contention that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was getting from Murray. Fournier also testified that Jackson failed to follow his instructions in two instances after being sedated for procedures. Jackson went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant for a bucket of chicken instead of going home and eating crackers, he testified. Another time he went to a rehearsal for a Grammy show performance and sprained his ankle, he said. Every instance where Jackson was given propofol was medically justified, Fournier said. The 14 times he administered it between 2000 and 2003 involved plastic surgeries, dermatological procedures and oral surgeries, he said. He first sedated Jackson in 1993 when he was being treated for serious scalp burns suffered while filming a Pepsi commercial several years earlier, he said. Some of the 25 times he was hired to assist with Jackson's procedures no drugs were given, he said. He would just hold his hand and assure him it would be all right. Jackson never asked for specific drugs and never quarreled with him, he said. All of the doctors who treated him were respected physicians, he said. Fournier's friendly relationship with Jackson ended in November 2003 when he canceled a procedure because Jackson was ""a little goofy, a little slow to respond."" Fournier said he refused to sedate Jackson because he suspected he was lying to him about his use of drugs. ""Despite 10 years of good quality care and taking good care of him for a long period of time, he never called me,"" he said. AEG Live's lead lawyer has said he would call as witnesses ""many, many, doctors"" who have treated Jackson to make their case that he was a secretive drug addict. The trial in a Los Angeles court concludes its 13th week Friday and is expected to last into September.","Nurse David Fournier gave Jackson propofol 14 times in 3 years .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was given a prestigious journalism award in Argentina on Tuesday, despite his frequent and outspoken criticism of media outlets at home and abroad. Chavez received the Rodolfo Walsh journalism award from Argentina's Universidad Nacional de La Plata ""for his unquestionable and authentic commitment to support the freedom of peoples."" During a raucous, two-hour acceptance speech in front of hundreds of students and the university's journalism faculty, Chavez accused large media outlets of ""manipulation"" and said that in Venezuela today, there is ""more freedom of expression and the press than any time in our history."" The Rodolfo Walsh award, given to people who advance the cause of press freedom, is named in honor of the late Argentine journalist who was killed in 1977 during Argentina's ""Dirty War,"" when military leaders systematically eliminated dissident voices. Walsh was also a co-founder of Prensa Latina, Cuba's state-run news agency. Past award winners include Argentine journalists Joaquin Morales Sola and Tomas Eloy Martinez as well as Bolivian president Evo Morales, a close ally of Chavez. Flush with petrodollars, Chavez's government in 2005 helped create Telesur, a state-funded television network that covers news from throughout Latin America and the globe. Telesur has been championed as an alternative voice to privately owned media conglomerates, but also criticized for its one-sided coverage of Chavez. Ironically, at Tuesday's award ceremony, private television networks were prohibited from broadcasting the event with their own cameras and instead had to air the signal provided by Telesur. Journalists and politicians in Argentina criticized the choice of Chavez as the award recipient, claiming that he has continually worked to silence his critics and suppress freedom of the press throughout Venezuela. ""Chavez has closed more than 30 radio stations and six television channels and constantly threatens to take away broadcast licenses of any media that is at all critical of his administration,"" said Jorge Macri, a congressman from Buenos Aires province. ""That's why I consider it a lack of respect for the people who have received this award previously that it is now being awarded to the Venezuelan president."" The award ceremony in Argentina came two days after protesters prevented trucks carrying Argentina's two largest daily newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion, from leaving the printing press. The action further inflamed an ongoing feud between Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and the Argentine media, which she has accused of unfairly criticizing her administration. Opposition leaders claim that the government authorized the blockade. On Monday, Clarin published a blank white page on its cover to protest the action. ""The Argentine government needs to take immediate measures to sanction this disregard and violation of a judicial ruling that constitutes an attack on freedom of the press,"" said Claudio Paolillo of the Inter American Press Society. Earlier Tuesday, Kirchner met with Chavez at the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, where they signed a series of economic accords. Kirchner skipped Chavez's award ceremony at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata -- which she and her late husband, former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, attended in the 1970s -- to meet with U2 frontman Bono, who is in Argentina for three concerts this week. According to a government spokesman, Bono asked Argentina's support in developing medical vaccines to eliminate diseases like malaria and for Kirchner's help in encouraging fellow G-20 leaders to demand that oil and mining companies publicly reveal their financial status.","Venezuelan president receives prestigious award honoring press freedom .

"(CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared Monday either to not know that demonstrators in cities throughout Libya are calling for an end to his rule or not accept it, according to excerpts from the interview, which a U.S. official described as ""delusional."" ""No demonstration at all in the streets,"" he told ABC News and the BBC in a joint interview carried out at a restaurant in Tripoli, excerpts of which were posted on the BBC's website. Told by the BBC's Jeremy Bowen that he had seen demonstrators in the streets that morning, Gadhafi asked, ""Are they supporting us?"" Gadhafi, wearing sunglasses and clad in brown tribal clothing, refused to accept the reporter's assertion that they were not. ""No. No one against us. Against me for what?"" He repeated his assertion that he is not president, but one of the people. ""They love me, all my people with me, they love me all. They will die to protect me, my people. No, no."" Asked why his people had captured and were holding the nation's second-largest city, Benghazi, Gadhafi said it was al Qaeda, not the Libyan people, who had done so. ""Al Qaeda,"" he said. ""They came from outside."" ABC's Christiane Amanpour, in a posting on the network's website, said Gadhafi arrived for the interview in a small convoy of sedans accompanied by little security. ""Gadhafi said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out, and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story,"" Amanpour wrote. He questioned how the international community could freeze his assets, impose sanctions and embargo arms sales based on media reports, and invited the United Nations to carry out an independent ""fact-finding mission,"" she reported. He vowed not to leave Libya, she reported, and denied having used force against his people. ""He seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him, and that other big cities in Libya, particularly those in the east, had been taken by his opponents,"" she said. ""He simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him. He denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation."" He reiterated an assertion he first made last week that his opponents have been given hallucinogens by al Qaeda operatives, and he said he felt betrayed by the United States, which had lifted its sanctions on the country after Gadhafi agreed to give up his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003. ""I'm surprised that we have an alliance with the West to fight al Qaeda, and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us,"" he said, according to Amanpour. ""Perhaps they want to occupy Libya."" Gadhafi called U.S. President Barack Obama a ""good man"" but said he might have been given ""misinformation."" ""The statements I have heard from him must have come from someone else,"" Gadhafi said. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice was unimpressed. ""It sounds, just frankly, delusional,"" she told reporters. ""And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people, it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality. ""It makes all the more important the urgent steps that we have taken over the course of the last week on a national basis, as well as the steps that we've taken collectively through the United Nations and the Security Council, and we're going to continue to keep the pressure on."" She called on Gadhafi ""to step aside to prevent further bloodshed and to allow the Libyan people to have a government that is responsive to their aspirations.""","NEW: ""It sounds, just frankly, delusional,"" says U.S. ambassador .

"The United States is preparing to announce a decision ""in the coming days"" on assistance to Egypt, the White House said Tuesday, and U.S. officials told CNN military aid will be cut, though not all of it. The announcement comes in the wake of the July coup against President Mohamed Morsy and the turmoil that has followed as recently as this week, one U.S. official said Tuesday. However, some military aid could continue, including funds to uphold Egypt's obligations under its peace treaty with Israel, and money for counterterrorism and security in Sinai, where extremists have been able to set up base, according to a senior U.S. official. The United States will also maintain nonmilitary funding that helps democracy promotion, the official said. In an initial report about the announcement, CNN did not specify that these portions of the aid would continue. Mohamed Morsy gets trial date as Egypt turmoil continues . The Obama administration withheld some military aid to Egypt in August. Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the move to suspend assistance -- more than $1 billion is given each year -- has been prompted by an ""accumulation of events,"" including recent violence against protesters, dozens of whom were killed over the weekend. The United States has not yet notified the Egyptians of the decision to cut off military aid, a senior official said. The announcement is not expected to be made on Wednesday and has already been pushed back a few times, the official said. In a statement late Tuesday, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said an announcement is coming soon but denied the United States is ""halting all military assistance."" ""We will announce the future of our assistance relationship with Egypt in the coming days, but as the president made clear at UNGA, that assistance relationship will continue,"" Hayden said in a statement. Any decision to cut aid would not preclude resuming the aid should Egypt make what the United States believes are positives steps towards restoring democracy, officials said. Death toll rises as violence rages . U.S. national security advisers recommended to the president last month that aid should be cut, U.S. officials told CNN in September. The recommendation, officials said, was made in a ""principals meeting"" of the president's national security team, including National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The meeting was the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the July 3 ouster of Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader. In addition to the suspension of some military aid earlier this year, there has also been a severe slowdown in military shipments from the United States to Egypt, including F-16s. The Obama administration has not labeled Morsy's removal from office a coup. Such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid. In the past, the White House has said it was in U.S. national security interests to keep the aid intact. But after U.S. calls to the Egyptian military for restraint over the last few months were met with a heavy-handed crackdown on Morsy supporters, Obama canceled a joint military exercise and announced a new review of U.S. aid to Egypt. Last month, U.S. officials said Obama's national security team had recommended a cut in aid that included all foreign military financing to the Egyptian military, except funding toward security in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Egyptian border with Gaza. ""This has been coming for quite a while, actually, and President Obama signaled that the United States was slowing down aid to Egypt in his address at the United Nations just a couple of weeks ago,"" said Robin Wright, an Arab affairs analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""The United States has become increasingly disillusioned with the way that the military leadership has cracked down on its own people. Over 1,000 died in the early weeks after the military coup, and in the past week, you've seen dozens more killed in confrontations."" CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said in the short-term, the U.S. decision could have a positive impact on the Egyptian government. ""Immediately, probably, the Egyptian government is going to find it's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion,"" Wedeman said. ""Egyptians I've already been in touch with about this decision or announcement from the United States that it's going to cut aid seem to react positively. There seems to be a lot of frustration with the United States, given its role in Egypt over the last 2½ years since the revolution."" But don't expect to see Egypt's military hurting financially, Wedeman said. ""For the Egyptian government, a cutoff in U.S. aid is symbolically significant, but in terms of the actual amount of money they're getting, it will not make a big difference,"" he said. Wedeman said that's because Gulf states have been pouring billions of dollars into Egypt since Morsy's ouster. A move to cut off aid would likely anger those Gulf allies who have urged the United States to support the military and warned against stopping assistance.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Florida Law enforcement officials said Monday they had launched an investigation into a tragic boating accident near St. Augustine, Florida, that took the lives of five people and seriously injured seven others. CNN affiliate WJXT shows the scene of the deadly boating accident near Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has taken over as the lead agency involved in the investigation. The incident took place on Sunday around 7:15 p.m., in the intracoastal waterway in St. Johns County, Florida, about 20 miles north of St. Augustine. According to FWC investigators, a 22-foot boat with 12 people on board rammed into the rear and right side of a 25-foot tugboat. ""We are still investigating and haven't come to any conclusions yet,"" said Carol Pratt, spokeswoman for FWC. She said they still do not know who was driving the boat. They also are waiting for victims' next of kin to be notified before releasing any of their names and ages. The tugboat was at a dock and boat launch under construction on the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Valley, said Jeremy Robshaw, a spokesman for St. Johns County Fire and Rescue. Robshaw said rescuers couldn't initially reach the end of the unfinished dock, but laid plywood sheets on the structure to get to crash victims. No one was onboard the tugboat, which is registered to F&A Enterprises in St. Augustine. The seven injured were taken to Shands Jacksonville Hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Two patients remain in critical condition, one is considered serious and three are in fair condition. A hospital spokesman did not have information on the seventh victim. FWC told CNN that they hope to release more information on the incident and on their investigation. As in any accident, toxicology studies will be done on the driver of the boat, to determine whether he or she was impaired, spokesman Carol Pratt told CNN.","Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission takes lead in the investigation.

"(CNN) -- Mexico is set to return to the Formula One calendar after an absence of more than two decades, F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has confirmed. The Mexico Grand Prix, along with races in New Jersey and South Korea, were included on the provisional calendar for 2014 only to be axed last December. But after last year's false start, the country now looks set to host its first F1 race in 23 years. ""I'm happy to announce we've concluded an agreement to have a race in 2015,"" Ecclestone said, the sport's official website reported. ""Don't miss this race!"" The race will be run at a refurbished 4.421-kilometre Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit in Mexico City. A date has yet to be finalized. Tavo Hellmund, organizer of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas and co-founding partner of the new Mexican Grand Prix said he was ""delighted"" a deal had been reached. ""Ever since Bernie and I began working on a race at Austin, it's been a dream of mine to help Formula One return to Mexico,"" said Hellmund. ""This announcement has therefore been years in the making, but we've gradually been able to assemble all the right pieces. I'm absolutely delighted,"" he added. Force India driver Sergio Perez, one of two Mexican drivers currently on the grid, also hailed the news. ""The return of F1 to our country is a sign that the Mexican state can achieve anything.""

"(CNN) -- OK, go ahead and get the ""Where's my global warming?"" jokes out of your system. With the U.S. Midwest trudging through its second blizzard in a week, we understand. But while it may seem contradictory at first, scientists say bigger blizzards fit the pattern they expect to see from a changing climate. The immediate meteorological cause of the back-to-back snowstorms is a colder-than-normal mass of air that's been hovering over the central United States, combined with an amped-up jet stream that's been dipping south from Canada. That makes conditions ripe for major snowstorms after a warmer-than-normal January for most of the Lower 48. ""Once you get into a pattern that sets up these storms, they can repeat themselves,"" National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini told CNN. The 21 inches that fell on Wichita, Kansas, in February just broke a monthly snowfall record set in 1913. Amarillo, Texas, saw 19 inches of snow on Monday alone, a total greater than its annual average and smashing a daily record of 12 inches that had stood since 1893. As researchers are quick to point out, weather is different than climate. Weather is what happens today, while climate involves trends in temperature and precipitation over decades. But global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since the 1880s, according to NASA, and because warmer air holds more moisture, a cold snap is likely to leave more snow on the ground. ""We have to keep in mind that in any given winter, you're going to have some big snowstorms,"" said Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the University of Georgia. ""But we're loading the dice or stacking the deck toward more intense blizzards."" While the idea of long-term climate change is a controversial notion politically, it's accepted as fact by most researchers. The warming trend is expected to continue if heat-trapping carbon dioxide -- a byproduct of fossil fuels -- continues to build up in the atmosphere. Sarah Kapnick, who studies snowfall patterns and climate at Princeton University, said the overall trend for snowfall in the western United States is down. Kapnick said her recent research points to more snow at high elevations and the Arctic, but the rest of the country would see less. ""The seasonal cycle is changing, and less of it accumulating,"" Kapnick said. Shepherd said scientists can't attribute any one storm to the effects of climate change, any more than they can point to a single home run as evidence that a baseball player has been using steroids. ""But when we get blizzards, they'll be stronger,"" he said.","A warming climate will mean worse storms but less snow overall, scientists say .

"(CNN) -- From wars in Ukraine and Afghanistan to the fast-spreading spectre of ISIS in the Middle East, it's no wonder that this week's NATO summit in Wales is being called ""the most important gathering of NATO leaders in more than a decade."" NATO leaders arriving in Cardiff will have a host of issues to deal with, so what should we expect? In short, we should see a return to NATO's core mission of facing a re-emerging security threat from the east. Russian President Vladimir Putin's push in to Ukraine has the 28-nation alliance focused on action -- and that goes double for NATO's new members in the east, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. But the 65-year-old alliance's worries aren't limited to Eastern Europe. ISIS, the terror group that has declared an independent state in Iraq and Syria in recent months, is threatening to spew violent ultra-jihadists on to NATO members' streets. And Afghanistan, NATO's biggest overseas commitment of troops, is in flux, so adjustments are required there as combat troops prepare to depart at the end of the year. Last -- but by no means least -- as NATO looks to its future, it wants to build on its past. The alliance will seek to use lessons it has learned in nation-building to create advisory and training teams in a drive to carve out a role as a global security hub. Return to core mission . A rapid or readiness action plan will emerge and will likely include much of the following: . 1. Preparing thousands of troops that can be ready to deploy at 48 hours' notice. 2. Preposition defense equipment at bases in Poland and the Baltic nations. 3. Equipping troops for constant rotation through the bases in front line states for as long as needed -- rather than maintaining a permanent force, which would contravene the NATO-Russia founding act. 4. Extending measures for air policing of NATO states. 5. Considering an increase in NATO's naval presence in the waters around member states. The major issues on the table will include: . Afghanistan . This is expected to be the first major topic up for discussion. NATO's role there will change as U.S. troops draw down over the next two and a half years. The role of ISAF forces in the country will shift from leading Afghan troops in the fight to supporting Afghans in an advisory and training role. Asymmetric and hybrid threats . NATO is also expected to discuss the best way to face Russia's new hybrid, or asymmetric style of attack -- Putin's sending of masked, unidentified ""green men"" into Ukraine to intertwine with local militias, rather than deploying a traditional invasion force of armored vehicles and tanks. The solutions to this challenge may include any of the following: special forces, cyberwarfare, counterinsurgency, greater intelligence gathering, or stronger border security. The aim is to reassure those NATO nations who feel most exposed to Putin's new nationalist-fueled expansionism -- namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland -- but it's also to improve the readiness time with which troops can be deployed to defend NATO's interests in the east. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who is attending the summit, will of course pay close attention to all these details, but as Ukraine is not a NATO member it may be of little direct benefit to him. The hope, of course, is that Putin will see NATO's resolve and recalibrate his westward adventurism. But nothing so far indicates that's remotely close to happening. In the interim, NATO leaders are expected to discuss how they can support Ukrainian democracy and strengthen security -- and also explore what further material and economic support they can offer to the war-torn country. Global Security Hub . Another major item on the agenda will be a discussion about NATO's role as a global security hub. The alliance is considering using its experience to build up the defense and security capacity of governments in hotspots around the world, using small teams of NATO advisers and trainers. Money . All NATO nations are obliged to commit 2% of their GDP on defense spending, but very few do. The U.S. spends 4.4% of its GDP on defense -- and President Barack Obama will be hoping to push the Europeans to keep closer to their commitment on this issue. ISIS . Obama is also keen to get NATO's support for tackling the growing ISIS menace emanating from Iraq and Syria. Perhaps indicating how late this issue has raced up the agenda, discussion on the topic may get it best airing at the summit dinner amid the trappings of historic warfare at Cardiff castle. Given the toxicity pervading discussion around Middle East intervention, the leaders will likely be hoping they don't leave the banquet with a bitter after taste.","NATO summit is called ""the most important gathering of NATO leaders in more than a decade""

"(CNN) -- As Inauguration Day approaches, the question on everyone's lips is: What will the first lady be wearing? Glitz, gowns and government bigwigs will all be on display at Monday's parade of inaugural pomp and circumstance. President Barack Obama will be ceremonially sworn into his second term in office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts around midday. After the daytime events, which will include the inaugural address and parade, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will end their night by taking to the dance floor at two inaugural balls. While the formal events bring out their fair share of celebrities, media mavens, and the just-darn-lucky citizens who scored tickets online, there will be only one belle of the ball: The first lady. Lessons in style from Michelle Obama . Behold one of the most prized traditions of the inaugural season: the wait for the dress. The hype around the inaugural ball gown is the closest thing this side of the pond to a royal wedding gown, and it's approached with the same gusto. ""There has always been an interest in what the first lady is wearing. Photographs and descriptions of the inaugural gown and who designed it have been news for decades,"" said Lisa Kathleen Graddy, the curator of The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection at the National Museum of American History. ""Sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers,"" she said. After all, it is typically the country's collective first impression of the first lady. Mr. President, who are you wearing? Monday evening, the president and first lady will attend the Commander in Chief's Ball, which honors service members and their families, a tradition started by former President George W. Bush; and at the Inaugural Ball, the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend. At the 2009 inaugural balls, Michelle Obama donned a white chiffon, one-shoulder dress created by Jason Wu, a then up-and-coming, 26-year-old Taiwanese-born designer. She didn't reveal who or what she would be wearing until she stepped out that night. Wu's name is now mentioned in the same breath as heavy-hitting designers like Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Hererra, Marc Jacobs and Diane Von Furstenberg. That now-iconic gown is part of ""A First Lady's Debut,"" a collection on display at The Smithsonian. Included in the display are the gowns worn by the 11 most recent first ladies, beginning with Mamie Eisenhower. The museum also houses The First Ladies Collection, which displays clothing worn by earlier White House residents. ""When we look at the gown that Jackie Kennedy wore 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore more than a hundred years before that, it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs, and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people,"" said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in March 2010. She continued: ""The detail of each gown -- the fabric, the cut, the color -- tells us something much more about each single first lady. It's a visual reminder that we each come from such different backgrounds, from different generations, and from different walks of life."" Graddy said Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan in particular captured the look and feel of their eras -- the early '50s, '60s and '80s, respectively. Mamie Eisenhower's iconic inaugural ball gown was designed by Jewish-American fashion designer Nettie Rosenstein, who championed ready-to-wear fashion and is credited by many with popularizing the ""little black dress."" It was a sparkling pink creation, made with 2,000 rhinestones. ""First Lady Pink"" soon became a popular color choice for ladies of the decade. While Eisenhower was quintessential 1950s, Jacqueline Kennedy went signature '60s with a gown by Ethel Frankau of Bergdorf Custom Salon. Frankau, who based the gown on descriptions and consultations with Mrs. Kennedy, created a slim, straight silhouette. A chiffon overlay covered an encrusted, off-white strapless bodice (wearing strapless couture without some sort of covering was considered risquÃ© at the time). Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan's hand-beaded gown by American couturier James Galanos cost $22,500 and oozed the Hollywood glamour that she and her actor-turned-politician husband brought to the White House. It's a given that no matter how handsome President Obama might look in his tuxedo at the galas, all eyes will be on his companion. ""The first lady is both an American celebrity and one of the most visible representatives of the nation. She's 'our' first lady and our pride and interest, and curiosity, extends to what she wears,"" Graddy said. See the past 100 years' worth of inaugural outfits in the gallery above.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Libya has paid $1.5 billion to the families of terrorism victims, overcoming the final obstacle to full relations with the United States, the State Department said Friday. Police officers survey the wreckage of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. The payment ends Tripoli's legal liability in U.S. terror cases and paves the way for increased U.S. involvement in the oil-rich nation. President Bush signed an executive order Friday restoring Libyan immunity from terrorism-related lawsuits and dismissing pending cases over compensation as part of a deal reached this summer. David Welch, the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, who negotiated the agreement, called Libya's rehabilitation from a terrorist nation to a U.S. ally ""historic."" The pact closes the book on a contentious period in U.S.-Libyan relations, which began in the 1980s with a series of attacks involving the two countries, including the bombings of Pan Am flight 103, a German disco and U.S. airstrikes over Libya. U.S. business executives hope the new relationship will lead to billions of dollars of new investment in Libya, a country rich in petroleum reserves but lacking a developed infrastructure. This summer, the United States and Libya signed a deal for the State Department to create a $1.8 billion compensation fund to finalize the claims for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1986 bombing of La Belle disco in Berlin, Germany. It also compensates Libyan victims of U.S. airstrikes in the 1980s. Congress unanimously adopted the Libyan Claims Resolution Act, sponsored by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, which cleared the way to end the feud and created the victim compensation fund. Under the agreement, Libya pays more than $500 million to settle remaining claims from the Lockerbie case and more than $280 million for victims of the disco bombing. It will also set aside funds to compensate victims of several other incidents blamed on Libya, although Libya has not accepted responsibility. In exchange, Libya will now be exempt from legislation passed this year enabling terrorism victims to be compensated using frozen assets of governments blamed for attacks. Tripoli sought the protection to encourage U.S. companies to invest in Libya without fear of being sued by terrorism victims or their families. An initial payment of $300 million was received this month, after the opening of a U.S. trade office in Libya and a historic visit by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Another $600 million was received Thursday and the remaining $600 million Friday, Welch said, adding that the families could start receiving payments within days. The remaining $300 million will go to Libyan victims of the bombing in Libya by U.S. warplanes in 1986. Libyans say dozens of people died in the U.S. air attack, including an adopted daughter of Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. President Reagan ordered the attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi after two U.S. soldiers were killed and 79 Americans were injured in the 1986 Berlin disco bombing. The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. Of the dead, 259 people died on board the plane and another 11 on the ground. Libya has paid 268 families involved in the Pan Am bombing $8 million each of a $10 million settlement. But it withheld the remaining $2 million owed to each family over a dispute regarding U.S. obligations to Tripoli. A group of relatives of Pan Am victims said in a statement Friday that they applauded Libya's fulfillment of the agreement. ""The Pan Am 103 families deeply appreciate Sen. Lautenberg's work to urge the administration to take every step to bring the agreement to fruition,"" spokeswoman Kara Weipz said in the statement. ""While our loved ones will never be forgotten, we are glad this chapter in our efforts is finally over."" Ties between the two countries began to improve in 2003, when Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program and began compensating Lockerbie victims. But lingering lawsuits prevented the two countries from fully normalizing ties. The State Department has said the deal was pursued on a ""purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party."" Senior State Department officials said the formula was designed to respect Libyan sensitivities about compensating victims for incidents for which it hasn't taken responsibility and also allow Libya to settle outstanding claims for the air strikes on Tripoli. Donations to settle Libyan claims were placed in the ""voluntary"" fund, from which each country involved in the claims draws the money to pay its citizens. Welch would not say exactly where the money came from but stressed that no American taxpayer money would be used to compensate Libya. The deal is to be followed by an upgrading of U.S. relations with Libya, including the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador, which was held up until the payments were made. Lautenberg applauded the payment Friday. ""American victims and their families have waited decades for Libya to pay for its deadly acts of violence and today they have received long-overdue justice,"" he said in a statement. ""I am pleased that our relentless pressure and support for terror victims has led to this historic moment."" Rice's visit in September, the first by a secretary of state since 1953, was hailed by both countries as a breakthrough. It followed months of negotiations between the two countries.","Payment is part of multitiered plan to normalize relations between the two countries .

"Riverside, California (CNN) -- Akiko Kosaka, a student from Japan attending the University of California at Riverside, had lost all hope for her family in Minamisanriku, the fishing village where more than half of the 17,000 residents are missing and feared dead in the aftermath of last week's tsunami. For three days, she scoured the Internet. She received one e-mail that her youngest sister, Yukako, 13, was likely safe in her middle school's shelter. But what about her parents, paternal grandparents and older sister, who all lived under the same roof? When the mayor was quoted in the media as saying he barely survived the tsunami, Kosaka thought the worst, because her father's pharmacy was located near the town hall. ""I didn't think they survived,"" Kosaka, 20, told CNN during a tearful interview Tuesday. ""I cried for three days -- Friday, Saturday, Sunday."" Then she received word Sunday night from a friend in Japan of the existence of a 45-second YouTube video showing her family home as the only one standing amid the rubble. The video highlighted her older sister holding a sign to a TV news crew saying in Japanese ""we are all safe."" Kosaka expressed relief upon hearing of the video, but became distraught after she couldn't find it online, despite staying up all night looking for it. Then a contact through a Japanese social network e-mailed her the link Monday morning. When seeing the video for the first time inside the home of her host family, Kosaka's reaction surprised everyone in the household. ""I screamed, and my host parents woke up and they thought it was really bad,"" Kosaka said. ""They asked what happened. And I said, 'They survived!'"" In the video, her 24-year-old sister, Shoko, is standing on the family home's balcony, off Kosaka's bedroom, and is asking the TV crew to pass along word to her sister in America that she's safe. Now Kosaka is trying to respond by using the media and the Internet to inform her relatives she's aware of their message -- though she's still concerned about them in the obliterated coastal village, which media accounts liken to a ghost town. Kosaka has yet to see her father, Katsumi; mother, Noriko; or paternal grandparents on any video -- or receive any word from them. Though she speaks English, Kosaka extended a message to them, in Japanese, through a CNN news crew: ""My older sister, Shoko, I saw your video. Thank you very much for being alive. It made me really happy that you are worried about me even in this tough situation. ""Grandpa and grandma, how is your health? Dad and mom, I know that everything is tough right now with your job and everything but I am so glad that you are alive. I really look forward to seeing you guys again."" In the offices of the University of California at Riverside Extension program, where she began a year-long study of English last September, Kosaka provided a personal narrative to the stark footage of her hometown street now in ruins. Kosaka's family home is the only one left standing on a hill because her father reconstructed the two-story house with a basement five years ago, Kosaka said. The other houses in the neighborhood were aging, she said. Kosaka expressed shock that the earthquake or the tsunami demolished the block because she thought the area would be safe on high ground, she said. Her family's house has a scenic view of the ocean, just a five-minute walk away, she said. In the video, a news crew approaches the family house, and Kosaka's older sister is wearing a white helmet and holds up one sign saying, ""Kosaka Family,"" and then another saying, ""We are all safe."" At another point in the video, the older sister indicates she's holding up the signs to the camera crew ""because my younger sister is in America. We are all okay."" When Kosaka heard of the video's existence, she thought to herself, ""I couldn't believe it. It's a miracle,"" she said. Since seeing the video, she watched it over and over again -- at least ""50 or something"" times within about 24 hours, she said, offering a wild guess. As she reviewed the video again Tuesday morning, Kosaka was still incredulous. ""This is my house,"" she said, viewing the video on a university office computer. ""When I saw this video, I was very shocked by it. I thought (the hillside community) was safe. There were houses next to my house, but they were destroyed. That means the tsunami came up to the house."" She was moved to see her sister shouting to the news crew from the balcony. ""It makes me very happy,"" Kosaka said. ""It's the only way to hear her voice."" Her sister's voice, though, struck Kosaka as ""tired and depressed."" ""Maybe she tries to stay strong for my family. So I'm very proud of her,"" Kosaka said. She believes her parents are likely OK, but her grandfather, Yoshio, is 85 and grandmother, Soyoko, is 80. ""My grandparents are old, so I'm worried about their health,"" Kosaka said, adding no one in her hometown probably has water, and the winter weather is still cold, with snow. She's also worried about the family pharmacy, where her father, 52, is a pharmacist and her mother assists. The family opened it 10 years ago. ""I think it was his dream,"" Kosaka added. Since Kosaka saw the video, she has been sharing her story with classmates. ""I cried in front of them too much,"" she said Tuesday. The University of California at Riverside Extension is the continuing education branch of the university and has an enrollment of 4,000 students from 60 countries who participate in English-language study or certificate programs, said Bronwyn Jenkins-Deas, associate dean and head of international programs. Of the 4,000 students, 109 of them are from Japan, and five of them had families affected by the quake or tsunami or both, Jenkins-Deas said. It is only Kosaka, though, who has yet to have direct contact with her family, Jenkins-Deas said. ""The story is quite amazing,"" Jenkins-Deas added.","Akiko Kosaka, 20, is from the tsunami-wracked village of Minami Sanriku, Japan .

"(CNN) -- The girlfriend of former NFL quarterback Steve McNair had grown frustrated with their relationship and was struggling with financial difficulties in the days before she killed him and herself in July. Steve McNair, former NFL quarterback, was a married father of four when he was killed last summer. Details of their relationship were revealed in a case summary released by Nashville police Monday. McNair, 36, and Sahel Kazemi, 20, were found fatally shot in a condominium in downtown Nashville on July 4. Police have since ruled their deaths a murder-suicide. ""My life is just s--- and I should end it,"" Kazemi said the night before the couple were found dead, according to Sonya New, her shift manager at a Dave & Busters restaurant. New also said Kazemi was not her usual self and seemed down. Though McNair was a married father of four, he was seeing Kazemi and at least one other woman, Leah Ignagni, according to Nashville police. McNair had spent the night at Ignagni's apartment on July 2, two nights before he was killed, Ignagni told police. On the morning of July 4, Kazemi texted McNair, saying she was stressed and needed money to pay bills. ""Baby I might have a break down im so stressed,"" Kazemi said in one text message. ""baby i might need to go to the hospital. baby whats wrong w(ith) me i can hardly breath(e)."" Chris Wall, who provided security for McNair and his family, told police he knew about McNair's relationship with Kazemi. McNair was tired of her calling when he was with his family, Wall said. Kazemi continued to text McNair throughout the day, asking for money and when she could see him next. ""baby what are u doing,"" Kazemi asked. ""At the pool with the kids. I got the guy transferring the money,"" McNair replied. At 4:04 p.m. on July 3, Kazemi said, ""baby I have to be w(ith) u 2nite. I dnt care where."" The messages continued for more than eight hours before McNair said he was on his way to the condo. He had told Kazemi earlier that he wouldn't leave the house ""til the kids fall asleep."" McNair and Kazemi exchanged a final series of messages early July 4, when he asked her to leave the front door to the condo open for him. A final message, sent at 1:14 a.m., simply said, ""its open.""

"Hargeisa, Somaliland (CNN) -- In 1856, British explorer Richard Burton described Somalia as a nation of poets. It may seem an unlikely moniker for a country that has since become defined by piracy, state collapse, and the many horrors unleashed by Al-Shabaab -- the Islamic extremists who control much of the country. But, much has changed since then. Despite appearances, the country used to be one of East Africa's most dynamic artistic enclaves, and much of the region's cultural activity took place in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, the internationally unrecognized state that broke away from Somalia in 1991. ""Hargeisa used to be the cultural hub for the Somali republic. There was a beautiful Chinese-built theater; also the main public library, at one time the biggest in Somalia,"" recalls Jama Muse Jama, who six years ago founded the Hargeisa Book Fair. The theater and library, like much of Hargeisa, was flattened during the civil war that preceded Somalia's collapse and Somaliland's declaration of independence. Now, Jama is hoping to restore some of what his country lost. ""If at the end of the fair, we have one more reader, we have succeeded,"" he says. The fair, which takes place during a week in August (this year's ended August 13), has become one of the most anticipated literary events in East Africa. Part book expo, part cultural festival (poets, musicians and dancers are as popular as the author panels), the fair attracts a variety of local literary legends like Hadraawi, widely considered the most famous living Somali poet. Outside, the hundreds in attendance throng around stalls selling new books published by the likes of the Redsea Online Publishing/Ponte Invisible -- a publishing company run by Jama -- and second-hand tomes, all to meet demand in this literature-hungry city. The city's dedication to the written word is particularly poignant, given that the Somali language didn't even have its own written alphabet until 1972. That year, Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre introduced a standard written version of the Somali language using Latin script. The Barre regime's move -- driven by a 5% literacy rate (according to the United Nations) -- represented a new approach beyond the oral poetic tradition. ""Government workers were given three months to learn. Anyone who failed was fired,"" recalls Said Salah Ahmed, an author, playwright and teacher of Somali at the University of Minnesota, who was a school principal at the time. As the campaign stretched from the cities to the towns to the smallest villages, he says teaching took place ""wherever -- under trees, under walls, wherever there was shade."" Jama also considers that period fondly. ""It was one of the best things that happened in Somali society,"" he says. While the first books to be published in the new language were mostly textbooks, there was also a smattering of European classics, with ""Animal Farm,"" ""Gulliver's Travels,"" and even Dale Carnegie's ""How To Win Friends And Influence People"" appearing on book shelves, according to Liban Ahmad, a Somali writer and teacher based in London. The period also brought on new forms of Somali literature, alongside poetry. ""Modern trends started to emerge, including original fiction works,"" recalls Mohamoud Shiekh Dalmar, who was working with the Somali Broadcasting Service. According to the UN, the Somali literacy rates climbed to 55% by the mid-1970s. Such progress wasn't sustainable though, as civil war and drought ultimately split the country. By 1990, literacy rates fell to 24%. Jama recalls books being burned at his school library. The official excuse given, he says, was that they fostered colonial sentiment, but he reasons that it was because they underlined Somaliland's separateness. ""It had been a flowering. But everything was killed,"" he says. Still, in the Somali diaspora aboad, a handful of authors, like Saleh and Dalmar, did their best to uphold the literary traditions. Now, with the help of writing and photography workshops held at the book fair, a new generation of young Somali writers will hopefully pick up the tradition. Saleh points out that new books are again being translated into Somali. Jama himself remains dedicated to his path: using the occasion of the 2014 fair to launch a new, permanent, European Union-funded cultural centre in Hargeisa. Somaliland's capital may yet reclaim its cultural-hub status. All it takes is a little imagination, which Jama has in spades.","Somaliland hosts one of the most anticipated book fair in East Africa .

"(CNN)  -- Donald Trump visited ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday night to tout his new book, ""Think Like a Champion."" In a wide-ranging interview, Trump shared his thoughts on how to prosper in this economy, Bernie Madoff, how President Obama is doing, taxes and his daughter's love life. On CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday night, Donald Trump said it's a great time for entrepreneurs. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: Why this book? Donald Trump: A lot of people wanted me to do a book right now about these troubled times that we're all in. And it's been sort of interesting. They're great times, as an entrepreneur. I don't think I've ever seen better times as an entrepreneur. But the world is a mess, and the country is a mess. King: Why [is it a] good time for an entrepreneur and not necessarily for others? Trump: Well, this is a time for smart people. This is a time for entrepreneurial people. This is a great time for people like me -- and maybe people like you, Larry, because I know you're a great investor. ... Weren't you involved with [Bernie] Madoff? King: A little bit, yes. You weren't, huh? How did you resist him? Trump: Honestly, I got lucky. He might have duped me like he did a lot of other people. He is a disaster. But now he's where he belongs. King: With troubled times like this for the average guy, is this the time to think like a champion?  Watch Larry King's entire interview with Donald Trump » . Trump:  This is the best time to think like a champion. As an example, the house is being foreclosed. You go see your bank -- maybe you can make a deal, maybe you can't. But you can make a deal with a bank on another house, and much better than the one you're living in. ... They'll do any deal to get rid of their product. They have houses by the thousands. And you go see that bank and you make a deal. King: How do you assess [Barack Obama]? Trump: Well, I really like him. I think that he's working very hard. He's trying to rebuild our reputation throughout the world. The previous administration was a total disaster, a total catastrophe. And, you know, the world looks at us differently than they used to. ... He was handed a pretty bad deck of cards. And I'm not saying I agree with everything he's doing. ... I do agree with what they're doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going. King: Do you assess him as a champion? Trump: Oh, yes, he's a champion. I mean, he won against all odds. When he first announced, people were giving him virtually no chance. And he's just done something that's amazing. King: Is fear harmful in this [economic] situation, Donald, or is it realistic? Trump: Well, I think it's realistic. People are afraid. They're scared. They're losing their jobs. They're losing their homes. And certainly there is a word known as fear, and there's nothing wrong with being fearful. But you have to do something about it. And that's what I write about in the book. You go out. You go to the right place, where there's better employment. You get a trade where they really need people. King: Have you had to lay off people? Because it seems everyone has had to do that. Trump: It's a sad thing, but whether it's ""The Apprentice"" or not,  the fact is you have to say to some people: ""You're fired."" The world is different. King: You said that this is a good time to buy real estate. What about financing? What if you want to buy and you can't get the mortgage? Trump: Larry, this is a great time to buy real estate. And as far as financing is concerned, the only financing you should be thinking about is seller financing. If the seller won't give you financing, don't do it, because the banks are not doing their job. They're not providing financing for deals. King: New York state is planning a so-called millionaire's tax. It would affect those with incomes starting at $300,000. Yea or nay? Trump: Well, it's a ridiculous thing. Albany is going to destroy  ... this state. And they are raising taxes on rich people. The rich people have lots of options, Larry. One option is Palm Beach, Florida. You move down to Palm Beach; it's not the worst thing in the world. I don't have to live on Fifth Avenue. I don't have to live on Park Avenue. It's hard, psychologically, for me to leave, but very easy physically. King: Why don't patriots want to pay taxes? Trump: Well, I don't know that that's necessarily unpatriotic. I think they want to pay taxes. Obviously, you have to pay taxes. But they want to pay a reasonable tax, and they don't want to see the money squandered. Money in this country is being squandered. King: OK. But then we would debate reasonable. Trump: Well, you always debate reasonable. I think unreasonable is the war in Iraq. I mean, there's $1 trillion right there. And, more importantly, thousands of people -- both on our side and the other side -- hundreds of thousands of people killed and maimed and so badly hurt, I think it's just a shame. Now, to me, that's unreasonable. And, by the way, ... Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center. King: Has the economy at all cramped your lifestyle? Anything you had to change? Trump: No, because I think I understand life. I think I understand how to live. I'm enjoying my life. I don't really live in an as extravagant a way as people think. As an entrepreneur, this is the best time I think I've ever seen in business. King: There's buzz that your beautiful daughter Ivanka is engaged or getting engaged. What's up? Trump: She has a beautiful boyfriend. He's a great guy, but they are not engaged. King: Would you like them to? Is he the kind of guy you would except as a son-in-law? Trump: He certainly is a wonderful guy. But it's all up to her. If she's happy, I'm happy.","Trump advises to take advantage of low prices, get seller to do the financing .

"(CNN) -- Strange things seem to happen when Grant Wilson enters a room. Grant Wilson, left, and partner Jason Hawes were driven by personal experiences to track ghosts. Human forms materialize in darkened hallways. The dead whisper greetings from beyond the grave. Unseen entities attack and hurl terrified people to the ground. Every day is Halloween for Wilson, co-star of the Sci Fi Channel's hit show, ""Ghost Hunters."" Close encounters of the paranormal kind would drive most people to look for another hobby, but Wilson says he ain't afraid of no ghosts. ""That's part of the job,"" says Wilson, who investigates suspected hauntings with his co-host, Jason Hawes.. ""We tell everyone that we train that you'll be punched, slapped and grabbed. Be prepared for it."" Anyone who has watched their 401(k) account evaporate during the recent stock market dive knows something about horror. But Wilson is part of a growing community that prefers getting their chills the old-fashioned way. They are ghost hunters, or, as they prefer to be called, paranormal investigators. ""Ghost-Hunters,"" which airs a special live show at 7 p.m. Halloween night, is helping lift the stigma once attached to paranormal investigators. The show has become so popular that the group featured in each episode -- The Atlantic Paranormal Society - has spawned imitators across the United States and affiliates in 12 countries. TAPS, as the ""Ghost Hunters"" group is informally known, even has its own ""Beyond Reality Radio"" show, magazine, lecture tours, T-shirts --and groupies. ""Ghost Hunters"" has made creepy cool, says David Schrader, a paranormal investigator and co-host of ""Darkness Radio,"" a radio show that investigates paranormal activity. ""Five or six years ago, you'd be embarrassed to sit around the water cooler talking about ghosts, but now everybody talks about it -- it's gone mainstream,"" Schrader says. It's also gone Hollywood. Paranormal shows like ""Paranormal State"" on A&E Television; ""Haunting Evidence"" on truTV (which, like CNN.com, is owned by Time Warner); ""Dead Famous"" on the Biography Channel; and ""A Haunting"" on the Discovery Channel are trying to mimic the success of ""Ghost Hunters."" Paranormal investigators aren't just chasing ghosts anymore; they're chasing television gigs, Schrader says. ""Everybody I know has a pilot in development -- including me,"" Schrader says. ""They throw it around like Frisbees. It's become a joke."" The paranormal shows have also created a paranormal circuit. Families and friends attend ghost-hunting conventions, retreats (one was dubbed ""GhoStock,"") swap tips on ghost-hunting gear and make pilgrimages to famous haunted places like The Stanley Hotel in Colorado, the setting for the Stephen King movie, ""The Shining.""  I hear dead people. » . Why they chase ghosts . Many of these amateur paranormal investigators are inspired -- and freaked out - by what they see on ""Ghost Hunters."" Some of the incidents recorded by ""Ghost Hunters"" are mystifying: Ghostly forms appear on camera, chairs lurch across rooms by themselves and voices of people long dead are played back to their wide-eyed relatives. In one of the most famous ""Ghost Hunters"" episodes, a cameraman is grabbed and hurled to the ground --though no one appears to touch him. The cameraman is so shaken that he sobs and quits the show. Wilson says people who think they have a ghost at home should not try a do-it-yourself home ghost repair. A person who uses Ouija boards or anything else to contact ghosts can unleash malevolent spirits. ""You might not be ready for what happens,"" Wilson says. Watch Grant's encounter with a ghost » . Some ghost-hunters say they entered the field because, like Wilson, they had personal experiences with the supernatural. Others want to know if there is something beyond death. Others like Marley Gibson, an author and paranormal investigator says they're more scared by current events. ""We're living in a world where we're fighting two wars, we've got poverty, homelessness, people not having health care and a job -- people want escapism,"" says Gibson, author of  ""Ghost Huntress: The Awakening"" a forthcoming book that follows the exploits of a 16-year-old girl who forms a paranormal research team. Ask ghost hunters if they get scared and many give the same reply -- I don't do scared, just startled. Gibson says many ghost-hunters go into investigations armed with strong spiritual beliefs. ""I've never met such spiritually-grounded, religious, God-fearing people as I have in the paranormal community,"" she says. 'I felt a ... very large finger or a paw poke me in the back' Sometimes paranormal investigators, though, admit they experience what Schrader, the Darkness Radio co-host calls, ""Oh [bleep]' moments."" Schrader had one last December, when he apparently took his job home with him one evening. He visited his ex-wife and children after coming back from a ghost-hunting retreat and decided to spend the night in the basement. Around three in the morning, he says, he heard his then one-year-old daughter screaming. He ran upstairs to hear her say that a shadow was watching her in her room. He comforted his daughter and returned to sleep downstairs. His wife then called him an hour later on his cell phone from her bedroom and whispered: ""Get up in my room. There's something here and I can see it."" Nothing was there but Schrader says some spirits had apparently thought it was OK to pay a visit to his family. He says people who are open to the existence of ghosts sometimes become ""beacons"" that attract spirits. Schrader decided to solve the problem by calling for a supernatural version of pest-control. He blessed the house with holy water and called in two ""demonologist"" to cleanse the house. No more ghosts. Patrick Burns, a paranormal investigator and co-host of ""Haunting Evidence,"" had one of his teeth-chattering moments when there was no one around to call. He says he was working on a documentary on ghosts from his home computer one night when he felt something touch him. ""I felt a very pronounced poke with a very large finger, or possibly a paw, just above my beltline on the back,"" he says. Now the average person might have taken that as a cue to run from the room. But Burns is a professional, and besides, he has his own paranormal television show. He shrugged and kept working. Then, he says, he felt the room temperature drop. Cold spots are often associated with hauntings, but Burns kept working because, as he said later: ""No way is my house is haunted."" Finally, he heard a thud that sounded like a body slammed against the wall. The impact is so hard that it shook the house, he says. ""I throw off my headphones and say, 'Okay you have my attention now,' ""Burns says. ""After that, nothing else happened. It just wanted me to acknowledge that it was there."" Sometimes encounters with the living can be just as strange as their encounters with the paranormal, ghost hunters say. Wilson, the  ""Ghost Hunters"" co-host, says he's more leery of people than ghosts. Paranormal investigators like him and Burns are now so famous that they have adoring fans. Wilson is a Roto-Rooter plumber by day, but he had to stop answering residential calls because too many people were breaking their toilets just to meet him Hawes, his ghost hunting/plumbing partner. Though Wilson says he's never been scared by a ghost, he still sounds shaken by one encounter. He says he once met an entity that displayed a personal interest in him. She appeared in front of him, displayed a tattoo of his face stenciled on her leg, and asked him what he thought. The ""entity"" was a fan Wilson met during a public appearance. ""That,"" Wilson admits, ""was a little scary.""","Sci Fi Channel ghost hunter says ghosts can get pushy .

"(CNN) -- After two years of a virtual stalemate of progress in Washington, members of Congress are headed home for five weeks during August. The pressure is on for both parties to tell two very different stories to voters with only a short time before the election. So who will have the better narrative? And will Americans listen? Voters are unhappy with everyone, which includes President Barack Obama, Democrats and Republicans. According to Real Clear Politics polling average, President Obama's approval rating stands at 41.6% while Congressional approval is in the tank at 12.3%. Partisan warfare is a clear culprit to these low ratings. During August, voters should be prepared to take plenty of Advil, because their headaches are about to get worse. Expect to hear Democrats complain loudly that Republicans are going to try to impeach Obama, that an attempt to sue the President is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the Supreme Court decision on contraceptives. Republicans will shout that Democrats are driving the impeachment story to fundraise off their liberal base, that the Senate is obstructing progress to protect their vulnerable members in red states from having to take tough votes and that suing Obama is necessary because he isn't doing his real job of working with Congress. The polarization merry-go-round in Washington can be very attractive for a member of Congress to fall into selling a partisan only message to their constituents. But, when Americans run into a TV show they don't like, they turn the channel. Voters are desperate to know about what can be accomplished to help them. Climate change isn't going to cut it for Democrats and abortion isn't going to work for Republicans. They simply don't connect to the average voter concerns. The issues that matter are front and center in everyday American life. Both sides are going to have to address the border crisis and their solutions to the problem. We are dealing with innocent children who are caught up in this mess. The news has saturated America and is a common topic around dinner tables and water coolers across the country. People are concerned and frustrated that Washington has spent too much time finger-pointing at each other. How do our elected officials plan to help create the conditions for more jobs, more money in their wallets and more food on the table? How can their lives be made better for themselves and their children? The Democrats will likely point to some positive economic indicators and rising consumer confidence to show that it is turning around. But they lack an overall agenda to demonstrate there is a future method toward achieving economic stability. Republicans can show they have a plan to turn around the economy faster, but rightfully point out the inaction by the Senate Democrats to address Republican plans. The House of Representatives, run by Republicans, has passed myriad bills dealing with job creation, gas prices and small business issues. These bills can be used as basis for a forward-looking agenda. The battle over the female voter will continue through August, with Democrats pointing to the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby decision on female contraception coverage as a threat to women's rights. The Democrats have also tried to push through votes appealing to the middle class on the minimum wage and the gender gap in pay. House Republicans finally wised up and recently offered a female agenda of their own right before the August break that would increase job training, incentivize flexible work schedules, provide tax breaks for children and families, and strengthens charter schools. The package also includes new legislation to prevent retaliation when women ask about equal pay. Beyond this rhetoric, there is a better opportunity for Republicans in this election cycle to sell a positive message to voters because Democrats are being forced to defend the White House and its handling of the crises at home and abroad. It's more difficult for a Democrat to have to answer questions about the missing e-mail scandal at the Internal Revenue Service or President Obama's handling of Israel or the Ukraine and then pivot to a positive message on female gender pay. Mad people vote. And people are mad at Washington. Republicans can blame the President for his failure of leadership, but the bulk of their arguments must be centered on positive solutions that connect with people who are tired of the finger pointing. This means that Americans could lean toward the GOP when they vote this November, if the focus is kept on what people are demanding to know, which is, ""How we get out of this mess?""

"(CNN) -- The businessman son of embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appears to be out of rebel hands and says he wants to negotiate a cease-fire to save Tripoli from ""a sea of blood."" In an e-mail exchange with CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, Saadi Gadhafi -- whose capture had been announced by the rebel leadership on Sunday -- said he had the authority to negotiate and wanted to discuss a cease-fire with U.S. and NATO officials. ""I will try to save my city Tripoli and 2 millions of people living there ... otherwise Tripoli will be lost forever like Somalia,"" he wrote. Without a cease-fire, he added, ""Soon it will be a sea of blood."" Saadi Gadhafi was one of three sons of the now-hunted Libyan leader who the rebel National Transitional Council announced had been captured during their weekend advance on Tripoli. However, they said Monday that one of the other two, Mohammed Gadhafi, had escaped. And Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- a top adviser to his father -- made an appearance before international journalists early Tuesday to refute reports of his arrest. Where is Libya's leader, and how long can he hold out? There was no immediate comment from NTC officials on Saadi Gadhafi's status or his offer, made a day after rebel forces overran his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound and claimed control over nearly all of Tripoli. Libyan government officials have made several previous cease-fire offers during the course of the six-month revolt against Gadhafi's 42-year rule.","Saadi Gadhafi exchanged e-mail with a CNN correspondent .
